also for the courses of the priests and the levites , and for all the work of the service of the house of the lord , and for all the vessels of service in the house of the lord .
he gave of gold by weight for things of gold , for all instruments of all manner of service ; silver also for all instruments of silver by weight , for all instruments of every kind of service :
then david gave to solomon his son the pattern of the porch , and of the houses thereof , and of the treasuries thereof , and of the upper chambers thereof , and of the inner parlours thereof , and of the place of the mercy seat ,
and the pattern of all that he had by the spirit , of the courts of the house of the lord , and of all the chambers round about , of the treasuries of the house of god , and of the treasuries of the dedicated things :
also pure gold for the fleshhooks , and the bowls , and the cups : and for the golden basons he gave gold by weight for every bason ; and likewise silver by weight for every bason of silver :
moreover i will make a covenant of peace with them ; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them : and i will place them , and multiply them , and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore .
and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight ; and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims , that spread out their wings , and covered the ark of the covenant of the lord .
my tabernacle also shall be with them : yea , i will be their god , and they shall be my people .
even the weight for the candlesticks of gold , and for their lamps of gold , by weight for every candlestick , and for the lamps thereof : and for the candlesticks of silver by weight , both for the candlestick , and also for the lamps thereof , according to the use of every candlestick .
and by weight he gave gold for the tables of shewbread , for every table ; and likewise silver for the tables of silver :
and i will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of israel ; and one king shall be king to them all : and they shall be no more two nations , neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all :
neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols , nor with their detestable things , nor with any of their transgressions : but i will save them out of all their dwellingplaces , wherein they have sinned , and will cleanse them : so shall they be my people , and i will be their god .
all this , said david , the lord made me understand in writing by his hand upon me , even all the works of this pattern .
and david my servant shall be king over them ; and they all shall have one shepherd : they shall also walk in my judgments , and observe my statutes , and do them .
and they shall dwell in the land that i have given unto jacob my servant , wherein your fathers have dwelt ; and they shall dwell therein , even they , and their children , and their children ' s children for ever : and my servant david shall be their prince for ever .
and ye shall know that i am the lord , when i have opened your graves , o my people , and brought you up out of your graves ,
and shall put my spirit in you , and ye shall live , and i shall place you in your own land : then shall ye know that i the lord have spoken it , and performed it , saith the lord .
then he said unto me , son of man , these bones are the whole house of israel : behold , they say , our bones are dried , and our hope is lost : we are cut off for our parts .
therefore prophesy and say unto them , thus saith the lord god ; behold , o my people , i will open your graves , and cause you to come up out of your graves , and bring you into the land of israel .
and join them one to another into one stick ; and they shall become one in thine hand .
the word of the lord came again unto me , saying ,
moreover , thou son of man , take thee one stick , and write upon it , for judah , and for the children of israel his companions : then take another stick , and write upon it , for joseph , the stick of ephraim , and for all the house of israel his companions :
ataroth , and dibon , and jazer , and nimrah , and heshbon , and elealeh , and shebam , and nebo , and beon ,
even the country which the lord smote before the congregation of israel , is a land for cattle , and thy servants have cattle :
wherefore , said they , if we have found grace in thy sight , let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession , and bring us not over jordan .
and moses said unto the children of gad and to the children of reuben , shall your brethren go to war , and shall ye sit here ?
and wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of israel from going over into the land which the lord hath given them ?
and say unto them , thus saith the lord god ; behold , i will take the children of israel from among the heathen , whither they be gone , and will gather them on every side , and bring them into their own land :
thus did your fathers , when i sent them from kadesh - barnea to see the land .
and the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes .
for when they went up unto the valley of eshcol , and saw the land , they discouraged the heart of the children of israel , that they should not go into the land which the lord had given them .
now the children of reuben and the children of gad had a very great multitude of cattle : and when they saw the land of jazer , and the land of gilead , that , behold , the place was a place for cattle ;
the children of gad and the children of reuben came and spake unto moses , and to eleazar the priest , and unto the princes of the congregation , saying ,
and the lord said unto me , distress not the moabites , neither contend with them in battle : for i will not give thee of their land for a possession ; because i have given ar unto the children of lot for a possession .
when he was come down from the mountain , great multitudes followed him .
and when we passed by from our brethren the children of esau , which dwelt in seir , through the way of the plain from elath , and from ezion - gaber , we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of moab .
for the lord thy god hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand : he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness : these forty years the lord thy god hath been with thee ; thou hast lacked nothing .
and jesus put forth his hand , and touched him , saying , i will ; be thou clean . and immediately his leprosy was cleansed .
and , behold , there came a leper and worshipped him , saying , lord , if thou wilt , thou canst make me clean .
meddle not with them ; for i will not give you of their land , no , not so much as a foot breadth ; because i have given mount seir unto esau for a possession .
and when jesus was entered into capernaum , there came unto him a centurion , beseeching him ,
and command thou the people , saying , ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of esau , which dwell in seir ; and they shall be afraid of you : take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore :
and jesus saith unto him , see thou tell no man ; but go thy way , shew thyself to the priest , and offer the gift that moses commanded , for a testimony unto them .
ye have compassed this mountain long enough : turn you northward .
and jesus saith unto him , i will come and heal him .
and the lord spake unto me , saying ,
and saying , lord , my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy , grievously tormented .
for i am a man under authority , having soldiers under me : and i say to this man , go , and he goeth ; and to another , come , and he cometh ; and to my servant , do this , and he doeth it .
the centurion answered and said , lord , i am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof : but speak the word only , and my servant shall be healed .
but ye shall offer the burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the lord ; two young bullocks , one ram , seven lambs of the first year ;
and it came to pass , that when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land , then i said , o lord god , forgive , i beseech thee : by whom shall jacob arise ? for he is small .
also in the day of the firstfruits , when ye bring a new meat offering unto the lord , after your weeks be out , ye shall have an holy convocation ; ye shall do no servile work :
a several tenth deal unto one lamb , throughout the seven lambs ;
thus hath the lord god shewed unto me : and , behold , the lord god called to contend by fire , and it devoured the great deep , and did eat up a part .
and their meat offering of flour mingled with oil , three tenth deals unto one bullock , two tenth deals unto one ram ,
then said i , o lord god , cease , i beseech thee : by whom shall jacob arise ? for he is small .
let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand , upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself .
so will not we go back from thee : quicken us , and we will call upon thy name .
turn us again , o lord god of hosts , cause thy face to shine ; and we shall be saved .
thus hath the lord god shewed unto me ; and , behold , he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth ; and , lo , it was the latter growth after the king ' s mowings .
a several tenth deal shalt thou offer for every lamb , throughout the seven lambs :
and their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil : three tenth deals shall ye offer for a bullock , and two tenth deals for a ram ;
ye shall offer these beside the burnt offering in the morning , which is for a continual burnt offering .
the lord repented for this : this also shall not be , saith the lord god .
and one goat for a sin offering , to make an atonement for you .
thus he shewed me : and , behold , the lord stood upon a wall made by a plumbline , with a plumbline in his hand .
and on the seventh day ye shall have an holy convocation ; ye shall do no servile work .
and the lord said unto me , amos , what seest thou ? and i said , a plumbline . then said the lord , behold , i will set a plumbline in the midst of my people israel : i will not again pass by them any more :
after this manner ye shall offer daily , throughout the seven days , the meat of the sacrifice made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the lord : it shall be offered beside the continual burnt offering , and his drink offering .
and the high places of isaac shall be desolate , and the sanctuaries of israel shall be laid waste ; and i will rise against the house of jeroboam with the sword .
ye shall offer them beside the continual burnt offering , and his meat offering , ( they shall be unto you without blemish ) and their drink offerings .
so the king of the south shall come into his kingdom , and shall return into his own land .
and shall also carry captives into egypt their gods , with their princes , and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold ; and he shall continue more years than the king of the north .
but out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate , which shall come with an army , and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north , and shall deal against them , and shall prevail :
and the king of the south shall be strong , and one of his princes ; and he shall be strong above him , and have dominion ; his dominion shall be a great dominion .
but ye shall offer a sacrifice made by fire for a burnt offering unto the lord ; two young bullocks , and one ram , and seven lambs of the first year : they shall be unto you without blemish :
in the first day shall be an holy convocation ; ye shall do no manner of servile work therein :
and in the fifteenth day of this month is the feast : seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten .
and in the fourteenth day of the first month is the passover of the lord .
and one kid of the goats for a sin offering unto the lord shall be offered , beside the continual burnt offering , and his drink offering .
and their drink offerings shall be half an hin of wine unto a bullock , and the third part of an hin unto a ram , and a fourth part of an hin unto a lamb : this is the burnt offering of every month throughout the months of the year .
and a mighty king shall stand up , that shall rule with great dominion , and do according to his will .
and a several tenth deal of flour mingled with oil for a meat offering unto one lamb ; for a burnt offering of a sweet savour , a sacrifice made by fire unto the lord .
and when he shall stand up , his kingdom shall be broken , and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven ; and not to his posterity , nor according to his dominion which he ruled : for his kingdom shall be plucked up , even for others beside those .
and three tenth deals of flour for a meat offering , mingled with oil , for one bullock ; and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering , mingled with oil , for one ram ;
also i in the first year of darius the mede , even i , stood to confirm and to strengthen him .
and in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the lord ; two young bullocks , and one ram , seven lambs of the first year without spot ;
and now will i shew thee the truth . behold , there shall stand up yet three kings in persia ; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all : and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of grecia .
this is the burnt offering of every sabbath , beside the continual burnt offering , and his drink offering .
moreover in those days the nobles of judah sent many letters unto tobiah , and the letters of tobiah came unto them .
and it came to pass , that when all our enemies heard thereof , and all the heathen that were about us saw these things , they were much cast down in their own eyes : for they perceived that this work was wrought of our god .
so the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month elul , in fifty and two days .
my god , think thou upon tobiah and sanballat according to these their works , and on the prophetess noadiah , and the rest of the prophets , that would have put me in fear .
therefore was he hired , that i should be afraid , and do so , and sin , and that they might have matter for an evil report , that they might reproach me .
and , lo , i perceived that god had not sent him ; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me : for tobiah and sanballat had hired him .
and i said , should such a man as i flee ? and who is there , that , being as i am , would go into the temple to save his life ? i will not go in .
also they reported his good deeds before me , and uttered my words to him . and tobiah sent letters to put me in fear .
for there were many in judah sworn unto him , because he was the son in law of shechaniah the son of arah ; and his son johanan had taken the daughter of meshullam the son of berechiah .
the hills were covered with the shadow of it , and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars .
she sent out her boughs unto the sea , and her branches unto the river .
why hast thou then broken down her hedges , so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her ?
the boar out of the wood doth waste it , and the wild beast of the field doth devour it .
return , we beseech thee , o god of hosts : look down from heaven , and behold , and visit this vine ;
and the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted , and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself .
it is burned with fire , it is cut down : they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance .
the measure thereof is longer than the earth , and broader than the sea .
and he said , i have been very jealous for the lord god of hosts : for the children of israel have forsaken thy covenant , thrown down thine altars , and slain thy prophets with the sword ; and i , even i only , am left ; and they seek my life , to take it away .
and they encamped against them , and destroyed the increase of the earth , till thou come unto gaza , and left no sustenance for israel , neither sheep , nor ox , nor ass .
should not the multitude of words be answered ? and should a man full of talk be justified ?
and so it was , when israel had sown , that the midianites came up , and the amalekites , and the children of the east , even they came up against them ;
then answered zophar the naamathite , and said ,
and the hand of midian prevailed against israel : and because of the midianites the children of israel made them the dens which are in the mountains , and caves , and strong holds .
for thou hast said , my doctrine is pure , and i am clean in thine eyes .
and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord : and the lord delivered them into the hand of midian seven years .
should thy lies make men hold their peace ? and when thou mockest , shall no man make thee ashamed ?
and he said , i have been very jealous for the lord god of hosts : because the children of israel have forsaken thy covenant , thrown down thine altars , and slain thy prophets with the sword ; and i , even i only , am left ; and they seek my life , to take it away .
and that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom , that they are double to that which is ! know therefore that god exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth .
and the lord said unto him , go , return on thy way to the wilderness of damascus : and when thou comest , anoint hazael to be king over syria :
but oh that god would speak , and open his lips against thee ;
and after the earthquake a fire ; but the lord was not in the fire : and after the fire a still small voice .
it is as high as heaven ; what canst thou do ? deeper than hell ; what canst thou know ?
canst thou by searching find out god ? canst thou find out the almighty unto perfection ?
and i delivered you out of the hand of the egyptians , and out of the hand of all that oppressed you , and drave them out from before you , and gave you their land ;
and it came to pass , when the children of israel cried unto the lord because of the midianites ,
that the lord sent a prophet unto the children of israel , which said unto them , thus saith the lord god of israel , i brought you up from egypt , and brought you forth out of the house of bondage ;
who also honoured us with many honours ; and when we departed , they laded us with such things as were necessary .
for they came up with their cattle and their tents , and they came as grasshoppers for multitude ; for both they and their camels were without number : and they entered into the land to destroy it .
and israel was greatly impoverished because of the midianites ; and the children of israel cried unto the lord .
saying , go unto this people , and say , hearing ye shall hear , and shall not understand ; and seeing ye shall see , and not perceive :
for the heart of this people is waxed gross , and their ears are dull of hearing , and their eyes have they closed ; lest they should see with their eyes , and hear with their ears , and understand with their heart , and should be converted , and i should heal them .
be it known therefore unto you , that the salvation of god is sent unto the gentiles , and that they will hear it .
and when he had said these words , the jews departed , and had great reasoning among themselves .
but we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest : for as concerning this sect , we know that every where it is spoken against .
and when they had appointed him a day , there came many to him into his lodging ; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of god , persuading them concerning jesus , both out of the law of moses , and out of the prophets , from morning till evening .
and some believed the things which were spoken , and some believed not .
and when they agreed not among themselves , they departed , after that paul had spoken one word , well spake the holy ghost by esaias the prophet unto our fathers ,
and paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house , and received all that came in unto him ,
preaching the kingdom of god , and teaching those things which concern the lord jesus christ , with all confidence , no man forbidding him .
but when the jews spake against it , i was constrained to appeal unto caesar ; not that i had ought to accuse my nation of .
who , when they had examined me , would have let me go , because there was no cause of death in me .
and from thence , when the brethren heard of us , they came to meet us as far as appiiforum , and the three taverns : whom when paul saw , he thanked god , and took courage .
and when we came to rome , the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard : but paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him .
and from thence we fetched a compass , and came to rhegium : and after one day the south wind blew , and we came the next day to puteoli :
where we found brethren , and were desired to tarry with them seven days : and so we went toward rome .
and he left the oxen , and ran after elijah , and said , let me , i pray thee , kiss my father and my mother , and then i will follow thee . and he said unto him , go back again : for what have i done to thee ?
and after three months we departed in a ship of alexandria , which had wintered in the isle , whose sign was castor and pollux .
and he returned back from him , and took a yoke of oxen , and slew them , and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen , and gave unto the people , and they did eat . then he arose , and went after elijah , and ministered unto him .
and landing at syracuse , we tarried there three days .
and they said unto him , we neither received letters out of judaea concerning thee , neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee .
for this cause therefore have i called for you , to see you , and to speak with you : because that for the hope of israel i am bound with this chain .
and it shall come to pass , that him that escapeth the sword of hazael shall jehu slay : and him that escapeth from the sword of jehu shall elisha slay .
and jehu the son of nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over israel : and elisha the son of shaphat of abel - meholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room .
so he departed thence , and found elisha the son of shaphat , who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him , and he with the twelfth : and elijah passed by him , and cast his mantle upon him .
yet i have left me seven thousand in israel , all the knees which have not bowed unto baal , and every mouth which hath not kissed him .
whom jason hath received : and these all do contrary to the decrees of caesar , saying that there is another king , one jesus .
and when they found them not , they drew jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city , crying , these that have turned the world upside down are come hither also ;
but the jews which believed not , moved with envy , took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort , and gathered a company , and set all the city on an uproar , and assaulted the house of jason , and sought to bring them out to the people .
and some of them believed , and consorted with paul and silas ; and of the devout greeks a great multitude , and of the chief women not a few .
opening and alleging , that christ must needs have suffered , and risen again from the dead ; and that this jesus , whom i preach unto you , is christ .
and paul , as his manner was , went in unto them , and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures ,
now when they had passed through amphipolis and apollonia , they came to thessalonica , where was a synagogue of the jews :
and when they had taken security of jason , and of the other , they let them go .
and among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives : namely , of the sons of jeshua the son of jozadak , and his brethren ; maaseiah , and eliezer , and jarib , and gedaliah .
and they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month .
and they gave their hands that they would put away their wives ; and being guilty , they offered a ram of the flock for their trespass .
and ezra the priest stood up , and said unto them , ye have transgressed , and have taken strange wives , to increase the trespass of israel .
then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice , as thou hast said , so must we do .
now therefore make confession unto the lord god of your fathers , and do his pleasure : and separate yourselves from the people of the land , and from the strange wives .
let now our rulers of all the congregation stand , and let all them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times , and with them the elders of every city , and the judges thereof , until the fierce wrath of our god for this matter be turned from us .
and the children of the captivity did so . and ezra the priest , with certain chief of the fathers , after the house of their fathers , and all of them by their names , were separated , and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter .
only jonathan the son of asahel and jahaziah the son of tikvah were employed about this matter : and meshullam and shabbethai the levite helped them .
jesus answered and said unto him , art thou a master of israel , and knowest not these things ?
if i have told you earthly things , and ye believe not , how shall ye believe , if i tell you of heavenly things ?
and it came to pass in the third year , that jehoshaphat the king of judah came down to the king of israel .
verily , verily , i say unto thee , we speak that we do know , and testify that we have seen ; and ye receive not our witness .
and they continued three years without war between syria and israel .
and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness , even so must the son of man be lifted up :
and no man hath ascended up to heaven , but he that came down from heaven , even the son of man which is in heaven .
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have eternal life .
he that believeth on him is not condemned : but he that believeth not is condemned already , because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god .
for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world ; but that the world through him might be saved .
and of the sons of bani ; meshullam , malluch , and adaiah , jashub , and sheal , and ramoth .
of the sons also of bebai ; jehohanan , hananiah , zabbai , and athlai .
also of the levites ; jozabad , and shimei , and kelaiah , ( the same is kelita , ) pethahiah , judah , and eliezer .
and jehoshaphat said , is there not here a prophet of the lord besides , that we might inquire of him ?
and of the sons of pashur ; elioenai , maaseiah , ishmael , nethaneel , jozabad , and elasah .
and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat , there is yet one man , micaiah the son of imlah , by whom we may inquire of the lord : but i hate him ; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me , but evil . and jehoshaphat said , let not the king say so .
and of the sons of harim ; maaseiah , and elijah , and shemaiah , and jehiel , and uzziah .
then the king of israel called an officer , and said , hasten hither micaiah the son of imlah .
and of the sons of immer ; hanani , and zebadiah .
and of the sons of zattu ; elioenai , eliashib , mattaniah , and jeremoth , and zabad , and aziza .
and the king of israel said unto his servants , know ye that ramoth in gilead is ours , and we be still , and take it not out of the hand of the king of syria ?
and of the sons of elam ; mattaniah , zechariah , and jehiel , and abdi , and jeremoth , and eliah .
and he said unto jehoshaphat , wilt thou go with me to battle to ramoth - gilead ? and jehoshaphat said to the king of israel , i am as thou art , my people as thy people , my horses as thy horses .
moreover of israel : of the sons of parosh ; ramiah , and jeziah , and malchiah , and miamin , and eleazar , and malchijah , and benaiah .
and jehoshaphat said unto the king of israel , inquire , i pray thee , at the word of the lord to day .
of the singers also ; eliashib : and of the porters ; shallum , and telem , and uri .
then the king of israel gathered the prophets together , about four hundred men , and said unto them , shall i go against ramoth - gilead to battle , or shall i forbear ? and they said , go up ; for the lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king .
john answered and said , a man can receive nothing , except it be given him from heaven .
and they came unto john , and said unto him , rabbi , he that was with thee beyond jordan , to whom thou barest witness , behold , the same baptizeth , and all men come to him .
then there arose a question between some of john ' s disciples and the jews about purifying .
for john was not yet cast into prison .
after these things came jesus and his disciples into the land of judaea ; and there he tarried with them , and baptized .
but he that doeth truth cometh to the light , that his deeds may be made manifest , that they are wrought in god .
for every one that doeth evil hateth the light , neither cometh to the light , lest his deeds should be reproved .
teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you : and , lo , i am with you alway , even unto the end of the world . amen .
he that hath the bride is the bridegroom : but the friend of the bridegroom , which standeth and heareth him , rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom ' s voice : this my joy therefore is fulfilled .
ye yourselves bear me witness , that i said , i am not the christ , but that i am sent before him .
he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life : and he that believeth not the son shall not see life ; but the wrath of god abideth on him .
the father loveth the son , and hath given all things into his hand .
and what he hath seen and heard , that he testifieth ; and no man receiveth his testimony .
he that cometh from above is above all : he that is of the earth is earthly , and speaketh of the earth : he that cometh from heaven is above all .
for he whom god hath sent speaketh the words of god : for god giveth not the spirit by measure unto him .
he that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that god is true .
the inhabitants of the villages ceased , they ceased in israel , until that i deborah arose , that i arose a mother in israel .
now when they were going , behold , some of the watch came into the city , and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done .
in the days of shamgar the son of anath , in the days of jael , the highways were unoccupied , and the travellers walked through byways .
and when they were assembled with the elders , and had taken counsel , they gave large money unto the soldiers ,
my heart is toward the governors of israel , that offered themselves willingly among the people . bless ye the lord .
they chose new gods ; then was war in the gates : was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in israel ?
then said jesus unto them , be not afraid : go tell my brethren that they go into galilee , and there shall they see me .
praise ye the lord for the avenging of israel , when the people willingly offered themselves .
then the eleven disciples went away into galilee , into a mountain where jesus had appointed them .
hear , o ye kings ; give ear , o ye princes ; i , even i , will sing unto the lord ; i will sing praise to the lord god of israel .
so they took the money , and did as they were taught : and this saying is commonly reported among the jews until this day .
lord , when thou wentest out of seir , when thou marchedst out of the field of edom , the earth trembled , and the heavens dropped , the clouds also dropped water .
and if this come to the governor ' s ears , we will persuade him , and secure you .
the mountains melted from before the lord , even that sinai from before the lord god of israel .
go ye therefore , and teach all nations , baptizing them in the name of the father , and of the son , and of the holy ghost :
and jesus came and spake unto them , saying , all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth .
then sang deborah and barak the son of abinoam on that day , saying ,
and when they saw him , they worshipped him : but some doubted .
he must increase , but i must decrease .
and she was a widow of about fourscore and four years , which departed not from the temple , but served god with fastings and prayers night and day .

( yea , a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also , ) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed .
sing praises to god , sing praises : sing praises unto our king , sing praises .
the wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island , and the satyr shall cry to his fellow ; the screech owl also shall rest there , and find for herself a place of rest .
and there was one anna , a prophetess , the daughter of phanuel , of the tribe of aser : she was of a great age , and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity ;
god is gone up with a shout , the lord with the sound of a trumpet .
and thorns shall come up in her palaces , nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof : and it shall be an habitation of dragons , and a court for owls .
they shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom , but none shall be there , and all her princes shall be nothing .
for mine eyes have seen thy salvation ,
but the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it ; the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it : and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion , and the stones of emptiness .
which thou hast prepared before the face of all people ;
for the lord most high is terrible ; he is a great king over all the earth .
it shall not be quenched night nor day ; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever : from generation to generation it shall lie waste ; none shall pass through it for ever and ever .
a light to lighten the gentiles , and the glory of thy people israel .
o clap your hands , all ye people ; shout unto god with the voice of triumph .
and he hath cast the lot for them , and his hand hath divided it unto them by line : they shall possess it for ever , from generation to generation shall they dwell therein .
a prudent man foreseeth the evil , and hideth himself ; but the simple pass on , and are punished .
my son , be wise , and make my heart glad , that i may answer him that reproacheth me .
he that blesseth his friend with a loud voice , rising early in the morning , it shall be counted a curse to him .
take his garment that is surety for a stranger , and take a pledge of him for a strange woman .
then took he him up in his arms , and blessed god , and said ,
lord , now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace , according to thy word :
and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost , that he should not see death , before he had seen the lord ' s christ .
thine own friend , and thy father ' s friend , forsake not ; neither go into thy brother ' s house in the day of thy calamity : for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off .
and he came by the spirit into the temple : and when the parents brought in the child jesus , to do for him after the custom of the law ,
and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the lord , a pair of turtledoves , or two young pigeons .
and , behold , there was a man in jerusalem , whose name was simeon ; and the same man was just and devout , waiting for the consolation of israel : and the holy ghost was upon him .
and when the days of her purification according to the law of moses were accomplished , they brought him to jerusalem , to present him to the lord ;
( as it is written in the law of the lord , every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the lord ; )
and the shepherds returned , glorifying and praising god for all the things that they had heard and seen , as it was told unto them .
and when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child , his name was called jesus , which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb .
as the fining pot for silver , and the furnace for gold ; so is a man to his praise .
hell and destruction are never full ; so the eyes of man are never satisfied .
the hay appeareth , and the tender grass sheweth itself , and herbs of the mountains are gathered .
for riches are not for ever : and doth the crown endure to every generation ?
be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks , and look well to thy herds .
though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle , yet will not his foolishness depart from him .
and he went down with them , and came to nazareth , and was subject unto them : but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart .
moreover he built cities in the mountains of judah , and in the forests he built castles and towers .
and jesus increased in wisdom and stature , and in favour with god and man .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord , according to all that his father uzziah did : howbeit he entered not into the temple of the lord . and the people did yet corruptly .
he built the high gate of the house of the lord , and on the wall of ophel he built much .
jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and he reigned sixteen years in jerusalem . his mother ' s name also was jerushah , the daughter of zadok .
mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land , that they may dwell with me : he that walketh in a perfect way , he shall serve me .
he that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house : he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight .
a froward heart shall depart from me : i will not know a wicked person .
whoso privily slandereth his neighbour , him will i cut off : him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not i suffer .
and jotham slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city of david : and ahaz his son reigned in his stead .
i will behave myself wisely in a perfect way . o when wilt thou come unto me ? i will walk within my house with a perfect heart .
he was five and twenty years old when he began to reign , and reigned sixteen years in jerusalem .
i will set no wicked thing before mine eyes : i hate the work of them that turn aside ; it shall not cleave to me .
and they understood not the saying which he spake unto them .
now the rest of the acts of jotham , and all his wars , and his ways , lo , they are written in the book of the kings of israel and judah .
so jotham became mighty , because he prepared his ways before the lord his god .
i will sing of mercy and judgment : unto thee , o lord , will i sing .
iron sharpeneth iron ; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend .
whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof : so he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured .
a continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike .
whosoever hideth her hideth the wind , and the ointment of his right hand , which bewrayeth itself .
as in water face answereth to face , so the heart of man to man .
let him drink , and forget his poverty , and remember his misery no more .
open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction .
and when they saw him , they were amazed : and his mother said unto him , son , why hast thou thus dealt with us ? behold , thy father and i have sought thee sorrowing .
open thy mouth , judge righteously , and plead the cause of the poor and needy .
and he said unto them , how is it that ye sought me ? wist ye not that i must be about my father ' s business ?
give not thy strength unto women , nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings .
it is not for kings , o lemuel , it is not for kings to drink wine ; nor for princes strong drink :
lest they drink , and forget the law , and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted .
give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish , and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts .
and when he was twelve years old , they went up to jerusalem after the custom of the feast .
and when they had fulfilled the days , as they returned , the child jesus tarried behind in jerusalem ; and joseph and his mother knew not of it .
and the child grew , and waxed strong in spirit , filled with wisdom : and the grace of god was upon him .
now his parents went to jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover .
and it came to pass , that after three days they found him in the temple , sitting in the midst of the doctors , both hearing them , and asking them questions .
and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers .
i will early destroy all the wicked of the land ; that i may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the lord .
but they , supposing him to have been in the company , went a day ' s journey ; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance .
and when they found him not , they turned back again to jerusalem , seeking him .
the lambs are for thy clothing , and the goats are the price of the field .
and thou shalt have goats ' milk enough for thy food , for the food of thy household , and for the maintenance for thy maidens .
what , my son ? and what , the son of my womb ? and what , the son of my vows ?
the words of king lemuel , the prophecy that his mother taught him .
but when the congregation is to be gathered together , ye shall blow , but ye shall not sound an alarm .
how much more abominable and filthy is man , which drinketh iniquity like water ?
and the sons of aaron , the priests , shall blow with the trumpets ; and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations .
i will shew thee , hear me ; and that which i have seen i will declare ;
and if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you , then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets ; and ye shall be remembered before the lord your god , and ye shall be saved from your enemies .
what is man , that he should be clean ? and he which is born of a woman , that he should be righteous ?
behold , he putteth no trust in his saints ; yea , the heavens are not clean in his sight .
and when they shall blow with them , all the assembly shall assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
and if they blow but with one trumpet , then the princes , which are heads of the thousands of israel , shall gather themselves unto thee .
which wise men have told from their fathers , and have not hid it :
when ye blow an alarm the second time , then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey : they shall blow an alarm for their journeys .
unto whom alone the earth was given , and no stranger passed among them .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
make thee two trumpets of silver ; of a whole piece shalt thou make them : that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly , and for the journeying of the camps .
that thou turnest thy spirit against god , and lettest such words go out of thy mouth ?
with us are both the grayheaded and very aged men , much elder than thy father .
for he stretcheth out his hand against god , and strengtheneth himself against the almighty .
he runneth upon him , even on his neck , upon the thick bosses of his bucklers :
because he covereth his face with his fatness , and maketh collops of fat on his flanks .
and he dwelleth in desolate cities , and in houses which no man inhabiteth , which are ready to become heaps .
he shall not be rich , neither shall his substance continue , neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth .
the wicked man travaileth with pain all his days , and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor .
he believeth not that he shall return out of darkness , and he is waited for of the sword .
a dreadful sound is in his ears : in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him .
trouble and anguish shall make him afraid ; they shall prevail against him , as a king ready to the battle .
he wandereth abroad for bread , saying , where is it ? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand .
therefore shall zion for your sake be plowed as a field , and jerusalem shall become heaps , and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest .
the heads thereof judge for reward , and the priests thereof teach for hire , and the prophets thereof divine for money : yet will they lean upon the lord , and say , is not the lord among us ? none evil can come upon us .
they build up zion with blood , and jerusalem with iniquity .
they conceive mischief , and bring forth vanity , and their belly prepareth deceit .
for the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate , and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery .
he shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine , and shall cast off his flower as the olive .
it shall be accomplished before his time , and his branch shall not be green .
he shall not depart out of darkness ; the flame shall dry up his branches , and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away .
it is not expedient for me doubtless to glory . i will come to visions and revelations of the lord .
and i knew such a man , ( whether in the body , or out of the body , i cannot tell : god knoweth ; )
how that he was caught up into paradise , and heard unspeakable words , which it is not lawful for a man to utter .
of such an one will i glory : yet of myself i will not glory , but in mine infirmities .
for though i would desire to glory , i shall not be a fool ; for i will say the truth : but now i forbear , lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be , or that he heareth of me .
and it shall come to pass , if there remain ten men in one house , that they shall die .
and lest i should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations , there was given to me a thorn in the flesh , the messenger of satan to buffet me , lest i should be exalted above measure .
the lord god hath sworn by himself , saith the lord the god of hosts , i abhor the excellency of jacob , and hate his palaces : therefore will i deliver up the city with all that is therein .
for this thing i besought the lord thrice , that it might depart from me .
therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive , and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removed .
and he said unto me , my grace is sufficient for thee : for my strength is made perfect in weakness . most gladly therefore will i rather glory in my infirmities , that the power of christ may rest upon me .
that drink wine in bowls , and anoint themselves with the chief ointments : but they are not grieved for the affliction of joseph .
that chant to the sound of the viol , and invent to themselves instruments of musick , like david ;
that lie upon beds of ivory , and stretch themselves upon their couches , and eat the lambs out of the flock , and the calves out of the midst of the stall ;
ye that put far away the evil day , and cause the seat of violence to come near ;
pass ye unto calneh , and see ; and from thence go ye to hamath the great : then go down to gath of the philistines : be they better than these kingdoms ? or their border greater than your border ?
woe to them that are at ease in zion , and trust in the mountain of samaria , which are named chief of the nations , to whom the house of israel came !
and the lords of the philistines passed on by hundreds , and by thousands : but david and his men passed on in the rereward with achish .
now the philistines gathered together all their armies to aphek : and the israelites pitched by a fountain which is in jezreel .
and david said unto achish , but what have i done ? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as i have been with thee unto this day , that i may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king ?
wherefore now return , and go in peace , that thou displease not the lords of the philistines .
and she brought it before saul , and before his servants ; and they did eat . then they rose up , and went away that night .
and the woman had a fat calf in the house ; and she hasted , and killed it , and took flour , and kneaded it , and did bake unleavened bread thereof :
but he refused , and said , i will not eat . but his servants , together with the woman , compelled him ; and he hearkened unto their voice . so he arose from the earth , and sat upon the bed .
woe to the bloody city ! it is all full of lies and robbery ; the prey departeth not ;
now therefore , i pray thee , hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid , and let me set a morsel of bread before thee ; and eat , that thou mayest have strength , when thou goest on thy way .
the noise of a whip , and the noise of the rattling of the wheels , and of the pransing horses , and of the jumping chariots .
the horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the glittering spear : and there is a multitude of slain , and a great number of carcases ; and there is none end of their corpses ; they stumble upon their corpses :
then saul fell straightway all along on the earth , and was sore afraid , because of the words of samuel : and there was no strength in him ; for he had eaten no bread all the day , nor all the night .
because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured harlot , the mistress of witchcrafts , that selleth nations through her whoredoms , and families through her witchcrafts .
behold , i am against thee , saith the lord of hosts ; and i will discover thy skirts upon thy face , and i will shew the nations thy nakedness , and the kingdoms thy shame .
and it shall come to pass , that all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee , and say , nineveh is laid waste : who will bemoan her ? whence shall i seek comforters for thee ?
art thou better than populous no , that was situate among the rivers , that had the waters round about it , whose rampart was the sea , and her wall was from the sea ?
ethiopia and egypt were her strength , and it was infinite ; put and lubim were thy helpers .
because thou obeyedst not the voice of the lord , nor executedst his fierce wrath upon amalek , therefore hath the lord done this thing unto thee this day .
and he said unto her , what form is he of ? and she said , an old man cometh up ; and he is covered with a mantle . and saul perceived that it was samuel , and he stooped with his face to the ground , and bowed himself .
then said samuel , wherefore then dost thou ask of me , seeing the lord is departed from thee , and is become thine enemy ?
and the lord hath done to him , as he spake by me : for the lord hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand , and given it to thy neighbour , even to david :
then said the woman , whom shall i bring up unto thee ? and he said , bring me up samuel .
and saul sware to her by the lord , saying , as the lord liveth , there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing .
and the king said unto her , be not afraid : for what sawest thou ? and the woman said unto saul , i saw gods ascending out of the earth .
and when the woman saw samuel , she cried with a loud voice : and the woman spake to saul , saying , why hast thou deceived me ? for thou art saul .

and he that was dead came forth , bound hand and foot with graveclothes : and his face was bound about with a napkin . jesus saith unto them , loose him , and let him go .
and when he thus had spoken , he cried with a loud voice , lazarus , come forth .
and i knew that thou hearest me always : but because of the people which stand by i said it , that they may believe that thou hast sent me .
then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid . and jesus lifted up his eyes , and said , father , i thank thee that thou hast heard me .
jesus saith unto her , said i not unto thee , that , if thou wouldest believe , thou shouldest see the glory of god ?
and one of them , named caiaphas , being the high priest that same year , said unto them , ye know nothing at all ,
if we let him thus alone , all men will believe on him : and the romans shall come and take away both our place and nation .
then gathered the chief priests and the pharisees a council , and said , what do we ? for this man doeth many miracles .
but some of them went their ways to the pharisees , and told them what things jesus had done .
then many of the jews which came to mary , and had seen the things which jesus did , believed on him .
the jews then which were with her in the house , and comforted her , when they saw mary , that she rose up hastily and went out , followed her , saying , she goeth unto the grave to weep there .
now jesus was not yet come into the town , but was in that place where martha met him .
when jesus therefore saw her weeping , and the jews also weeping which came with her , he groaned in the spirit , and was troubled ,
then when mary was come where jesus was , and saw him , she fell down at his feet , saying unto him , lord , if thou hadst been here , my brother had not died .
jesus said , take ye away the stone . martha , the sister of him that was dead , saith unto him , lord , by this time he stinketh : for he hath been dead four days .
jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave . it was a cave , and a stone lay upon it .
jesus wept .
and said , where have ye laid him ? they said unto him , lord , come and see .
and some of them said , could not this man , which opened the eyes of the blind , have caused that even this man should not have died ?
then said the jews , behold how he loved him !
but i know , that even now , whatsoever thou wilt ask of god , god will give it thee .
then said martha unto jesus , lord , if thou hadst been here , my brother had not died .
then martha , as soon as she heard that jesus was coming , went and met him : but mary sat still in the house .
and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die . believest thou this ?
martha saith unto him , i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day .
jesus saith unto her , thy brother shall rise again .
as soon as she heard that , she arose quickly , and came unto him .
and when she had so said , she went her way , and called mary her sister secretly , saying , the master is come , and calleth for thee .
she saith unto him , yea , lord : i believe that thou art the christ , the son of god , which should come into the world .
therefore i was left alone , and saw this great vision , and there remained no strength in me : for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption , and i retained no strength .
yet heard i the voice of his words : and when i heard the voice of his words , then was i in a deep sleep on my face , and my face toward the ground .
his body also was like the beryl , and his face as the appearance of lightning , and his eyes as lamps of fire , and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass , and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude .
and i daniel alone saw the vision : for the men that were with me saw not the vision ; but a great quaking fell upon them , so that they fled to hide themselves .
these things said he : and after that he saith unto them , our friend lazarus sleepeth ; but i go , that i may awake him out of sleep .
but if a man walk in the night , he stumbleth , because there is no light in him .
howbeit jesus spake of his death : but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep .
then were there brought unto him little children , that he should put his hands on them , and pray : and the disciples rebuked them .
then said his disciples , lord , if he sleep , he shall do well .
and i am glad for your sakes that i was not there , to the intent ye may believe ; nevertheless let us go unto him .
but he said unto them , all men cannot receive this saying , save they to whom it is given .
then said jesus unto them plainly , lazarus is dead .
then when jesus came , he found that he had lain in the grave four days already .
then said thomas , which is called didymus , unto his fellowdisciples , let us also go , that we may die with him .
his disciples say unto him , if the case of the man be so with his wife , it is not good to marry .
and many of the jews came to martha and mary , to comfort them concerning their brother .
now bethany was nigh unto jerusalem , about fifteen furlongs off :
these are the journeys of the children of israel , which went forth out of the land of egypt with their armies under the hand of moses and aaron .
honour thy father and thy mother : and , thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself .
he saith unto him , which ? jesus said , thou shalt do no murder , thou shalt not commit adultery , thou shalt not steal , thou shalt not bear false witness ,
and he said unto him , why callest thou me good ? there is none good but one , that is , god : but if thou wilt enter into life , keep the commandments .
and , behold , one came and said unto him , good master , what good thing shall i do , that i may have eternal life ?
and he laid his hands on them , and departed thence .
and they departed from succoth , and pitched in etham , which is in the edge of the wilderness .
and they removed from etham , and turned again unto pi - hahiroth , which is before baal - zephon : and they pitched before migdol .
and they departed from before pi - hahiroth , and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness , and went three days ' journey in the wilderness of etham , and pitched in marah .
and they removed from marah , and came unto elim : and in elim were twelve fountains of water , and threescore and ten palm trees ; and they pitched there .
and moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of the lord : and these are their journeys according to their goings out .
then i lifted up mine eyes , and looked , and behold a certain man clothed in linen , whose loins were girded with fine gold of uphaz :
and they departed from rameses in the first month , on the fifteenth day of the first month ; on the morrow after the passover the children of israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the egyptians .
and in the four and twentieth day of the first month , as i was by the side of the great river , which is hiddekel ;
for the egyptians buried all their firstborn , which the lord had smitten among them : upon their gods also the lord executed judgments .
i ate no pleasant bread , neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth , neither did i anoint myself at all , till three whole weeks were fulfilled .
and the children of israel removed from rameses , and pitched in succoth .
in those days i daniel was mourning three full weeks .
he and his people with him , the terrible of the nations , shall be brought to destroy the land : and they shall draw their swords against egypt , and fill the land with the slain .
but when the multitudes saw it , they marvelled , and glorified god , which had given such power unto men .
thus saith the lord god ; i will also make the multitude of egypt to cease by the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon .
and he arose , and departed to his house .
and as jesus passed forth from thence , he saw a man , named matthew , sitting at the receipt of custom : and he saith unto him , follow me . and he arose , and followed him .
for demas hath forsaken me , having loved this present world , and is departed unto thessalonica ; crescens to galatia , titus unto dalmatia .
and i will pour my fury upon sin , the strength of egypt ; and i will cut off the multitude of no .
and jesus knowing their thoughts said , wherefore think ye evil in your hearts ?
only luke is with me . take mark , and bring him with thee : for he is profitable to me for the ministry .
and i will make pathros desolate , and will set fire in zoan , and will execute judgments in no .
and , behold , certain of the scribes said within themselves , this man blasphemeth .
and tychicus have i sent to ephesus .
thus saith the lord god ; i will also destroy the idols , and i will cause their images to cease out of noph ; and there shall be no more a prince of the land of egypt : and i will put a fear in the land of egypt .
but that ye may know that the son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins , ( then saith he to the sick of the palsy , ) arise , take up thy bed , and go unto thine house .
the cloke that i left at troas with carpus , when thou comest , bring with thee , and the books , but especially the parchments .
and i will make the rivers dry , and sell the land into the hand of the wicked : and i will make the land waste , and all that is therein , by the hand of strangers : i the lord have spoken it .
for whether is easier , to say , thy sins be forgiven thee ; or to say , arise , and walk ?
thus will i execute judgments in egypt : and they shall know that i am the lord .
at tehaphnehes also the day shall be darkened , when i shall break there the yokes of egypt : and the pomp of her strength shall cease in her : as for her , a cloud shall cover her , and her daughters shall go into captivity .
the young men of aven and of pi - beseth shall fall by the sword : and these cities shall go into captivity .
and , behold , they brought to him a man sick of the palsy , lying on a bed : and jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy ; son , be of good cheer ; thy sins be forgiven thee .
and i will set fire in egypt : sin shall have great pain , and no shall be rent asunder , and noph shall have distresses daily .
and he entered into a ship , and passed over , and came into his own city .
salute prisca and aquila , and the household of onesiphorus .
and the lord shall deliver me from every evil work , and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom : to whom be glory for ever and ever . amen .
that i may not seem as if i would terrify you by letters .
for though i should boast somewhat more of our authority , which the lord hath given us for edification , and not for your destruction , i should not be ashamed :
do ye look on things after the outward appearance ? if any man trust to himself that he is christ ' s , let him of himself think this again , that , as he is christ ' s , even so are we christ ' s .
of whom be thou ware also ; for he hath greatly withstood our words .
and having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience , when your obedience is fulfilled .
alexander the coppersmith did me much evil : the lord reward him according to his works :
casting down imaginations , and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god , and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ ;
notwithstanding the lord stood with me , and strengthened me ; that by me the preaching might be fully known , and that all the gentiles might hear : and i was delivered out of the mouth of the lion .
at my first answer no man stood with me , but all men forsook me : i pray god that it may not be laid to their charge .
for though we walk in the flesh , we do not war after the flesh :
therefore thus saith the lord god ; behold , i am against pharaoh king of egypt , and will break his arms , the strong , and that which was broken ; and i will cause the sword to fall out of his hand .
son of man , i have broken the arm of pharaoh king of egypt ; and , lo , it shall not be bound up to be healed , to put a roller to bind it , to make it strong to hold the sword .
and i will strengthen the arms of the king of babylon , and put my sword in his hand : but i will break pharaoh ' s arms , and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man .
and i will scatter the egyptians among the nations , and will disperse them through the countries .
do thy diligence to come before winter . eubulus greeteth thee , and pudens , and linus , and claudia , and all the brethren .
and i will scatter the egyptians among the nations , and disperse them among the countries ; and they shall know that i am the lord .
the lord jesus christ be with thy spirit . grace be with you . amen .
but i will strengthen the arms of the king of babylon , and the arms of pharaoh shall fall down ; and they shall know that i am the lord , when i shall put my sword into the hand of the king of babylon , and he shall stretch it out upon the land of egypt .
erastus abode at corinth : but trophimus have i left at miletum sick .
but when ye sin so against the brethren , and wound their weak conscience , ye sin against christ .
wherefore , if meat make my brother to offend , i will eat no flesh while the world standeth , lest i make my brother to offend .
for if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol ' s temple , shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols ;
and through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish , for whom christ died ?
now both the chief priests and the pharisees had given a commandment , that , if any man knew where he were , he should shew it , that they might take him .
nor consider that it is expedient for us , that one man should die for the people , and that the whole nation perish not .
and this spake he not of himself : but being high priest that year , he prophesied that jesus should die for that nation ;
and not for that nation only , but that also he should gather together in one the children of god that were scattered abroad .
then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death .
jesus therefore walked no more openly among the jews ; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness , into a city called ephraim , and there continued with his disciples .
and the jews ' passover was nigh at hand : and many went out of the country up to jerusalem before the passover , to purify themselves .
these be the words which moses spake unto all israel on this side jordan in the wilderness , in the plain over against the red sea , between paran , and tophel , and laban , and hazeroth , and dizahab .
and it came to pass in the fortieth year , in the eleventh month , on the first day of the month , that moses spake unto the children of israel , according unto all that the lord had given him in commandment unto them ;
on this side jordan , in the land of moab , began moses to declare this law , saying ,
the lord our god spake unto us in horeb , saying , ye have dwelt long enough in this mount :
behold , i have set the land before you : go in and possess the land which the lord sware unto your fathers , abraham , isaac , and jacob , to give unto them and to their seed after them .
and i spake unto you at that time , saying , i am not able to bear you myself alone :
but mary kept all these things , and pondered them in her heart .
and all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds .
and when they had seen it , they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child .
and they came with haste , and found mary , and joseph , and the babe lying in a manger .
and it came to pass , as the angels were gone away from them into heaven , the shepherds said one to another , let us now go even unto bethlehem , and see this thing which is come to pass , which the lord hath made known unto us .
glory to god in the highest , and on earth peace , good will toward men .
and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising god , and saying ,
and the angel said unto them , fear not : for , behold , i bring you good tidings of great joy , which shall be to all people .

for thus saith the lord ; behold , they whose judgment was not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken ; and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished ? thou shalt not go unpunished , but thou shalt surely drink of it .
but i have made esau bare , i have uncovered his secret places , and he shall not be able to hide himself : his seed is spoiled , and his brethren , and his neighbours , and he is not .
for , lo , i will make thee small among the heathen , and despised among men .
thy terribleness hath deceived thee , and the pride of thine heart , o thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock , that holdest the height of the hill : though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle , i will bring thee down from thence , saith the lord .
for i have sworn by myself , saith the lord , that bozrah shall become a desolation , a reproach , a waste , and a curse ; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes .
i have heard a rumour from the lord , and an ambassador is sent unto the heathen , saying , gather ye together , and come against her , and rise up to the battle .
also edom shall be a desolation : every one that goeth by it shall be astonished , and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof .
as in the overthrow of sodom and gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof , saith the lord , no man shall abide there , neither shall a son of man dwell in it .
thou knowest that i am not wicked ; and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand .
their tents and their flocks shall they take away : they shall take to themselves their curtains , and all their vessels , and their camels ; and they shall cry unto them , fear is on every side .
that thou inquirest after mine iniquity , and searchest after my sin ?
concerning kedar , and concerning the kingdoms of hazor , which nebuchadrezzar king of babylon shall smite , thus saith the lord ; arise ye , go up to kedar , and spoil the men of the east .
thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about ; yet thou dost destroy me .
is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress , that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands , and shine upon the counsel of the wicked ?
how is the city of praise not left , the city of my joy !
i will say unto god , do not condemn me ; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me .
damascus is waxed feeble , and turneth herself to flee , and fear hath seized on her : anguish and sorrows have taken her , as a woman in travail .
are thy days as the days of man ? are thy years as man ' s days ,
hast thou eyes of flesh ? or seest thou as man seeth ?
therefore her young men shall fall in her streets , and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day , saith the lord of hosts .
the earth is moved at the noise of their fall , at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the red sea .
and jesus said unto them , verily i say unto you , that ye which have followed me , in the regeneration when the son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory , ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones , judging the twelve tribes of israel .
therefore hear the counsel of the lord , that he hath taken against edom ; and his purposes , that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of teman : surely the least of the flock shall draw them out : surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them .
and every one that hath forsaken houses , or brethren , or sisters , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or lands , for my name ' s sake , shall receive an hundredfold , and shall inherit everlasting life .
but jesus beheld them , and said unto them , with men this is impossible ; but with god all things are possible .
behold , he shall come up and fly as the eagle , and spread his wings over bozrah : and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs .
then answered peter and said unto him , behold , we have forsaken all , and followed thee ; what shall we have therefore ?
jesus said unto him , if thou wilt be perfect , go and sell that thou hast , and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come and follow me .
the young man saith unto him , all these things have i kept from my youth up : what lack i yet ?
when his disciples heard it , they were exceedingly amazed , saying , who then can be saved ?
and again i say unto you , it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god .
then said jesus unto his disciples , verily i say unto you , that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven .
but when the young man heard that saying , he went away sorrowful : for he had great possessions .
but it shall come to pass in the latter days , that i will bring again the captivity of elam , saith the lord .
and i will set my throne in elam , and will destroy from thence the king and the princes , saith the lord .
for i will cause elam to be dismayed before their enemies , and before them that seek their life : and i will bring evil upon them even my fierce anger , saith the lord ; and i will send the sword after them , till i have consumed them :
and upon elam will i bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven , and will scatter them toward all those winds ; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of elam shall not come .
thus saith the lord of hosts ; behold , i will break the bow of elam , the chief of their might .
the word of the lord that came to jeremiah the prophet against elam in the beginning of the reign of zedekiah king of judah , saying ,
and hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons , and a desolation for ever : there shall no man abide there , nor any son of man dwell in it .
and their camels shall be a booty , and the multitude of their cattle a spoil : and i will scatter into all winds them that are in the utmost corners ; and i will bring their calamity from all sides thereof , saith the lord .
arise , get you up unto the wealthy nation , that dwelleth without care , saith the lord , which have neither gates nor bars , which dwell alone .
flee , get you far off , dwell deep , o ye inhabitants of hazor , saith the lord ; for nebuchadrezzar king of babylon hath taken counsel against you , and hath conceived a purpose against you .
but many that are first shall be last ; and the last shall be first .

who is this king of glory ? the lord of hosts , he is the king of glory . selah .
but he answered and said unto them , an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign ; and there shall no sign be given to it , but the sign of the prophet jonas :
then certain of the scribes and of the pharisees answered , saying , master , we would see a sign from thee .
a good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things : and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things .
o generation of vipers , how can ye , being evil , speak good things ? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh .
for by thy words thou shalt be justified , and by thy words thou shalt be condemned .
but i say unto you , that every idle word that men shall speak , they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment .
wherefore i say unto you , all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men : but the blasphemy against the holy ghost shall not be forgiven unto men .
he that is not with me is against me ; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad .
either make the tree good , and his fruit good ; or else make the tree corrupt , and his fruit corrupt : for the tree is known by his fruit .
and whosoever speaketh a word against the son of man , it shall be forgiven him : but whosoever speaketh against the holy ghost , it shall not be forgiven him , neither in this world , neither in the world to come .
for as jonas was three days and three nights in the whale ' s belly ; so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth .
and he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples , and said , behold my mother and my brethren !
but he answered and said unto him that told him , who is my mother ? and who are my brethren ?
then one said unto him , behold , thy mother and thy brethren stand without , desiring to speak with thee .
while he yet talked to the people , behold , his mother and his brethren stood without , desiring to speak with him .
then goeth he , and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself , and they enter in and dwell there : and the last state of that man is worse than the first . even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation .
then he saith , i will return into my house from whence i came out ; and when he is come , he findeth it empty , swept , and garnished .
when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man , he walketh through dry places , seeking rest , and findeth none .
the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon ; and , behold , a greater than solomon is here .
and all the drinking vessels of king solomon were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forest of lebanon were of pure gold : none were of silver ; it was not any thing accounted of in the days of solomon .
for whosoever shall do the will of my father which is in heaven , the same is my brother , and sister , and mother .
for the king ' s ships went to tarshish with the servants of huram : every three years once came the ships of tarshish bringing gold , and silver , ivory , and apes , and peacocks .
and king solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom .
and all the kings of the earth sought the presence of solomon , to hear his wisdom , that god had put in his heart .
and they brought every man his present , vessels of silver , and vessels of gold , and raiment , harness , and spices , horses , and mules , a rate year by year .
and solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots , and twelve thousand horsemen ; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities , and with the king at jerusalem .
and he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the land of the philistines , and to the border of egypt .
and the king made silver in jerusalem as stones , and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the low plains in abundance .
and they brought unto solomon horses out of egypt , and out of all lands .
now the rest of the acts of solomon , first and last , are they not written in the book of nathan the prophet , and in the prophecy of ahijah the shilonite , and in the visions of iddo the seer against jeroboam the son of nebat ?
and he shall take a wife in her virginity .
enter into his gates with thanksgiving , and into his courts with praise : be thankful unto him , and bless his name .
and twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps . there was not the like made in any kingdom .
a widow , or a divorced woman , or profane , or an harlot , these shall he not take : but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife .
know ye that the lord he is god : it is he that hath made us , and not we ourselves ; we are his people , and the sheep of his pasture .
neither shall he profane his seed among his people : for i the lord do sanctify him .
serve the lord with gladness : come before his presence with singing .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
make a joyful noise unto the lord , all ye lands .
and he that is the high priest among his brethren , upon whose head the anointing oil was poured , and that is consecrated to put on the garments , shall not uncover his head , nor rend his clothes ;
neither shall he go in to any dead body , nor defile himself for his father , or for his mother ;
neither shall he go out of the sanctuary , nor profane the sanctuary of his god ; for the crown of the anointing oil of his god is upon him : i am the lord .
for the lord is good ; his mercy is everlasting ; and his truth endureth to all generations .
speak unto aaron , saying , whosoever he be of thy seed in their generations that hath any blemish , let him not approach to offer the bread of his god .
for whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish , he shall not approach : a blind man , or a lame , or he that hath a flat nose , or any thing superfluous ,
or a man that is brokenfooted , or brokenhanded ,
and barak said unto her , if thou wilt go with me , then i will go : but if thou wilt not go with me , then i will not go .
every word of god is pure : he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him .
and i will draw unto thee to the river kishon sisera , the captain of jabin ' s army , with his chariots and his multitude ; and i will deliver him into thine hand .
who hath ascended up into heaven , or descended ? who hath gathered the wind in his fists ? who hath bound the waters in a garment ? who hath established all the ends of the earth ? what is his name , and what is his son ' s name , if thou canst tell ?
two things have i required of thee ; deny me them not before i die :
add thou not unto his words , lest he reprove thee , and thou be found a liar .
and solomon slept with his fathers , and he was buried in the city of david his father : and rehoboam his son reigned in his stead .
lest i be full , and deny thee , and say , who is the lord ? or lest i be poor , and steal , and take the name of my god in vain .
remove far from me vanity and lies : give me neither poverty nor riches ; feed me with food convenient for me :
and solomon reigned in jerusalem over all israel forty years .
and the children of israel again did evil in the sight of the lord , when ehud was dead .
and the lord sold them into the hand of jabin king of canaan , that reigned in hazor ; the captain of whose host was sisera , which dwelt in harosheth of the gentiles .
and the children of israel cried unto the lord : for he had nine hundred chariots of iron ; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of israel .
and deborah , a prophetess , the wife of lapidoth , she judged israel at that time .
the words of agur the son of jakeh , even the prophecy : the man spake unto ithiel , even unto ithiel and ucal ,
surely i am more brutish than any man , and have not the understanding of a man .
and she sent and called barak the son of abinoam out of kedesh - naphtali , and said unto him , hath not the lord god of israel commanded , saying , go and draw toward mount tabor , and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of naphtali and of the children of zebulun ?
i neither learned wisdom , nor have the knowledge of the holy .
him would paul have to go forth with him ; and took and circumcised him because of the jews which were in those quarters : for they knew all that his father was a greek .
and as they went through the cities , they delivered them the decrees for to keep , that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at jerusalem .
then came he to derbe and lystra : and , behold , a certain disciple was there , named timotheus , the son of a certain woman , which was a jewess , and believed ; but his father was a greek :
which was well reported of by the brethren that were at lystra and iconium .
and they passing by mysia came down to troas .
and so were the churches established in the faith , and increased in number daily .
now when they had gone throughout phrygia and the region of galatia , and were forbidden of the holy ghost to preach the word in asia ,
and a vision appeared to paul in the night ; there stood a man of macedonia , and prayed him , saying , come over into macedonia , and help us .
the roaring of the lion , and the voice of the fierce lion , and the teeth of the young lions , are broken .
the old lion perisheth for lack of prey , and the stout lion ' s whelps are scattered abroad .
fear came upon me , and trembling , which made all my bones to shake .
then a spirit passed before my face ; the hair of my flesh stood up :
now a thing was secretly brought to me , and mine ear received a little thereof .
in thoughts from the visions of the night , when deep sleep falleth on men ,
behold , he put no trust in his servants ; and his angels he charged with folly :
how much less in them that dwell in houses of clay , whose foundation is in the dust , which are crushed before the moth ?
it stood still , but i could not discern the form thereof : an image was before mine eyes , there was silence , and i heard a voice , saying ,
shall mortal man be more just than god ? shall a man be more pure than his maker ?
and there were six steps to the throne , with a footstool of gold , which were fastened to the throne , and stays on each side of the sitting place , and two lions standing by the stays :
moreover the king made a great throne of ivory , and overlaid it with pure gold .
and three hundred shields made he of beaten gold : three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield . and the king put them in the house of the forest of lebanon .
and when rachel saw that she bare jacob no children , rachel envied her sister ; and said unto jacob , give me children , or else i die .
and king solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold : six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target .
and jacob ' s anger was kindled against rachel : and he said , am i in god ' s stead , who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb ?
beside that which chapmen and merchants brought . and all the kings of arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to solomon .
and she said , behold my maid bilhah , go in unto her ; and she shall bear upon my knees that i may also have children by her .
now the weight of gold that came to solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold ;
and it came to pass after these things , that naboth the jezreelite had a vineyard , which was in jezreel , hard by the palace of ahab king of samaria .
and she gave him bilhah her handmaid to wife : and jacob went in unto her .
and king solomon gave to the queen of sheba all her desire , whatsoever she asked , beside that which she had brought unto the king . so she turned , and went away to her own land , she and her servants .
and bilhah conceived , and bare jacob a son .
and the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of the lord , and to the king ' s palace , and harps and psalteries for singers : and there were none such seen before in the land of judah .
and naboth said to ahab , the lord forbid it me , that i should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee .
and rachel said , god hath judged me , and hath also heard my voice , and hath given me a son : therefore called she his name dan .
and the servants also of huram , and the servants of solomon , which brought gold from ophir , brought algum trees and precious stones .
they are destroyed from morning to evening : they perish for ever without any regarding it .
doth not their excellency which is in them go away ? they die , even without wisdom .
but jezebel his wife came to him , and said unto him , why is thy spirit so sad , that thou eatest no bread ?
and rachel said , with great wrestlings have i wrestled with my sister , and i have prevailed : and she called his name naphtali .
only he shall not go in unto the vail , nor come nigh unto the altar , because he hath a blemish ; that he profane not my sanctuaries : for i the lord do sanctify them .
and ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which naboth the jezreelite had spoken to him : for he had said , i will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers . and he laid him down upon his bed , and turned away his face , and would eat no bread .
and bilhah rachel ' s maid conceived again , and bare jacob a second son .
he shall eat the bread of his god , both of the most holy , and of the holy .
the lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps , and strangled for his lionesses , and filled his holes with prey , and his dens with ravin .
and jezebel his wife said unto him , dost thou now govern the kingdom of israel ? arise , and eat bread , and let thine heart be merry : i will give thee the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite .
no man that hath a blemish of the seed of aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the lord made by fire : he hath a blemish ; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his god .
where is the dwelling of the lions , and the feedingplace of the young lions , where the lion , even the old lion , walked , and the lion ' s whelp , and none made them afraid ?
and he said unto her , because i spake unto naboth the jezreelite , and said unto him , give me thy vineyard for money ; or else , if it please thee , i will give thee another vineyard for it : and he answered , i will not give thee my vineyard .
or crookbackt , or a dwarf , or that hath a blemish in his eye , or be scurvy , or scabbed , or hath his stones broken ;
she is empty , and void , and waste : and the heart melteth , and the knees smite together , and much pain is in all loins , and the faces of them all gather blackness .
and she wrote in the letters , saying , proclaim a fast , and set naboth on high among the people :
so she wrote letters in ahab ' s name , and sealed them with his seal , and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city , dwelling with naboth .
and moses told it unto aaron , and to his sons , and unto all the children of israel .
moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of hinnom , and burnt his children in the fire , after the abominations of the heathen whom the lord had cast out before the children of israel .
he sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places , and on the hills , and under every green tree .
ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign , and he reigned sixteen years in jerusalem : but he did not that which was right in the sight of the lord , like david his father :
for he walked in the ways of the kings of israel , and made also molten images for baalim .
serving the lord with all humility of mind , and with many tears , and temptations , which befell me by the lying in wait of the jews :
and they brought the young man alive , and were not a little comforted .
and when he met with us at assos , we took him in , and came to mitylene .
and , behold , there was a man which had his hand withered . and they asked him , saying , is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days ? that they might accuse him .
and we went before to ship , and sailed unto assos , there intending to take in paul : for so had he appointed , minding himself to go afoot .
and he said unto them , what man shall there be among you , that shall have one sheep , and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day , will he not lay hold on it , and lift it out ?
for paul had determined to sail by ephesus , because he would not spend the time in asia : for he hasted , if it were possible for him , to be at jerusalem the day of pentecost .
how much then is a man better than a sheep ? wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days .
and we sailed thence , and came the next day over against chios ; and the next day we arrived at samos , and tarried at trogyllium ; and the next day we came to miletus .
then saith he to the man , stretch forth thine hand . and he stretched it forth ; and it was restored whole , like as the other .
and when they were come to him , he said unto them , ye know , from the first day that i came into asia , after what manner i have been with you at all seasons ,
then the pharisees went out , and held a council against him , how they might destroy him .
and from miletus he sent to ephesus , and called the elders of the church .
but when jesus knew it , he withdrew himself from thence : and great multitudes followed him , and he healed them all ;
and the children of israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand , women , sons , and daughters , and took also away much spoil from them , and brought the spoil to samaria .
and charged them that they should not make him known :
and zichri , a mighty man of ephraim , slew maaseiah the king ' s son , and azrikam the governor of the house , and elkanah that was next to the king .
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias the prophet , saying ,
for pekah the son of remaliah slew in judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day , which were all valiant men ; because they had forsaken the lord god of their fathers .
behold my servant , whom i have chosen ; my beloved , in whom my soul is well pleased : i will put my spirit upon him , and he shall shew judgment to the gentiles .
wherefore the lord his god delivered him into the hand of the king of syria ; and they smote him , and carried away a great multitude of them captives , and brought them to damascus . and he was also delivered into the hand of the king of israel , who smote him with a great slaughter .
he shall not strive , nor cry ; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets .
and paul went down , and fell on him , and embracing him said , trouble not yourselves ; for his life is in him .
and now , behold , i know that ye all , among whom i have gone preaching the kingdom of god , shall see my face no more .
and in his name shall the gentiles trust .
but none of these things move me , neither count i my life dear unto myself , so that i might finish my course with joy , and the ministry , which i have received of the lord jesus , to testify the gospel of the grace of god .
then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil , blind , and dumb : and he healed him , insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw .
save that the holy ghost witnesseth in every city , saying that bonds and afflictions abide me .
and now , behold , i go bound in the spirit unto jerusalem , not knowing the things that shall befall me there :
a bruised reed shall he not break , and smoking flax shall he not quench , till he send forth judgment unto victory .
for i know this , that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you , not sparing the flock .
take heed therefore unto yourselves , and to all the flock , over the which the holy ghost hath made you overseers , to feed the church of god , which he hath purchased with his own blood .
and if satan cast out satan , he is divided against himself ; how shall then his kingdom stand ?
for i have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of god .
and all the people were amazed , and said , is not this the son of david ?
wherefore i take you to record this day , that i am pure from the blood of all men .
but when the pharisees heard it , they said , this fellow doth not cast out devils , but by beelzebub the prince of the devils .
or else how can one enter into a strong man ' s house , and spoil his goods , except he first bind the strong man ? and then he will spoil his house .
and if i by beelzebub cast out devils , by whom do your children cast them out ? therefore they shall be your judges .
but if i cast out devils by the spirit of god , then the kingdom of god is come unto you .
testifying both to the jews , and also to the greeks , repentance toward god , and faith toward our lord jesus christ .
and how i kept back nothing that was profitable unto you , but have shewed you , and have taught you publickly , and from house to house ,
therefore watch , and remember , that by the space of three years i ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears .
and now , brethren , i commend you to god , and to the word of his grace , which is able to build you up , and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified .
also of your own selves shall men arise , speaking perverse things , to draw away disciples after them .
as every man hath received the gift , even so minister the same one to another , as good stewards of the manifold grace of god .
if any man speak , let him speak as the oracles of god ; if any man minister , let him do it as of the ability which god giveth : that god in all things may be glorified through jesus christ , to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever . amen .
and they all wept sore , and fell on paul ' s neck , and kissed him ,
beloved , think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you , as though some strange thing happened unto you :
sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake , that they should see his face no more . and they accompanied him unto the ship .
i have shewed you all things , how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak , and to remember the words of the lord jesus , how he said , it is more blessed to give than to receive .
and when he had thus spoken , he kneeled down , and prayed with them all .
i have coveted no man ' s silver , or gold , or apparel .
yea , ye yourselves know , that these hands have ministered unto my necessities , and to them that were with me .
and if the righteous scarcely be saved , where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear ?
for the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of god : and if it first begin at us , what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of god ?
come , behold the works of the lord , what desolations he hath made in the earth .
wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of god commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing , as unto a faithful creator .
he maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth ; he breaketh the bow , and cutteth the spear in sunder ; he burneth the chariot in the fire .
if ye be reproached for the name of christ , happy are ye ; for the spirit of glory and of god resteth upon you : on their part he is evil spoken of , but on your part he is glorified .
would to god ye could bear with me a little in my folly : and indeed bear with me .
but rejoice , inasmuch as ye are partakers of christ ' s sufferings ; that , when his glory shall be revealed , ye may be glad also with exceeding joy .
yet if any man suffer as a christian , let him not be ashamed ; but let him glorify god on this behalf .
but let none of you suffer as a murderer , or as a thief , or as an evildoer , or as a busybody in other men ' s matters .
therefore will not we fear , though the earth be removed , and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea ;
though the waters thereof roar and be troubled , though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof . selah .
god is our refuge and strength , a very present help in trouble .
the heathen raged , the kingdoms were moved : he uttered his voice , the earth melted .
the lord of hosts is with us ; the god of jacob is our refuge . selah .
there is a river , the streams whereof shall make glad the city of god , the holy place of the tabernacles of the most high .
god is in the midst of her ; she shall not be moved : god shall help her , and that right early .
and when the year was expired , king nebuchadnezzar sent , and brought him to babylon , with the goodly vessels of the house of the lord , and made zedekiah his brother king over judah and jerusalem .
but they mocked the messengers of god , and despised his words , and misused his prophets , until the wrath of the lord arose against his people , till there was no remedy .
and all the vessels of the house of god , great and small , and the treasures of the house of the lord , and the treasures of the king , and of his princes ; all these he brought to babylon .
therefore he brought upon them the king of the chaldees , who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary , and had no compassion upon young man or maiden , old man , or him that stooped for age : he gave them all into his hand .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord his god , and humbled not himself before jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of the lord .
zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign , and reigned eleven years in jerusalem .
moreover all the chief of the priests , and the people , transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen ; and polluted the house of the lord which he had hallowed in jerusalem .
and he also rebelled against king nebuchadnezzar , who had made him swear by god : but he stiffened his neck , and hardened his heart from turning unto the lord god of israel .
and they burnt the house of god , and brake down the wall of jerusalem , and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire , and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof .
for thus saith the lord god ; the city that went out by a thousand shall leave an hundred , and that which went forth by an hundred shall leave ten , to the house of israel .
hear ye this word which i take up against you , even a lamentation , o house of israel .
ye who turn judgment to wormwood , and leave off righteousness in the earth ,
seek the lord , and ye shall live ; lest he break out like fire in the house of joseph , and devour it , and there be none to quench it in bethel .
but seek not bethel , nor enter into gilgal , and pass not to beer - sheba : for gilgal shall surely go into captivity , and bethel shall come to nought .
for thus saith the lord unto the house of israel , seek ye me , and ye shall live :
but though i be rude in speech , yet not in knowledge ; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things .
have i committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted , because i have preached to you the gospel of god freely ?
i robbed other churches , taking wages of them , to do you service .
that strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong , so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress .
and when i was present with you , and wanted , i was chargeable to no man : for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from macedonia supplied : and in all things i have kept myself from being burdensome unto you , and so will i keep myself .
seek him that maketh the seven stars and orion , and turneth the shadow of death into the morning , and maketh the day dark with night : that calleth for the waters of the sea , and poureth them out upon the face of the earth : the lord is his name :
for i am jealous over you with godly jealousy : for i have espoused you to one husband , that i may present you as a chaste virgin to christ .
but i fear , lest by any means , as the serpent beguiled eve through his subtilty , so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ .
for if he that cometh preacheth another jesus , whom we have not preached , or if ye receive another spirit , which ye have not received , or another gospel , which ye have not accepted , ye might well bear with him .
for i suppose i was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles .
and after three days and an half the spirit of life from god entered into them , and they stood upon their feet ; and great fear fell upon them which saw them .
and they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them , and make merry , and shall send gifts one to another ; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth .
and the same hour was there a great earthquake , and the tenth part of the city fell , and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand : and the remnant were affrighted , and gave glory to the god of heaven .
and they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them , come up hither . and they ascended up to heaven in a cloud ; and their enemies beheld them .
and the seventh angel sounded ; and there were great voices in heaven , saying , the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our lord , and of his christ ; and he shall reign for ever and ever .
the second woe is past ; and , behold , the third woe cometh quickly .
saying , we give thee thanks , o lord god almighty , which art , and wast , and art to come ; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power , and hast reigned .
and the four and twenty elders , which sat before god on their seats , fell upon their faces , and worshipped god ,
and the temple of god was opened in heaven , and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament : and there were lightnings , and voices , and thunderings , and an earthquake , and great hail .
and saul disguised himself , and put on other raiment , and he went , and two men with him , and they came to the woman by night : and he said , i pray thee , divine unto me by the familiar spirit , and bring me him up , whom i shall name unto thee .
and he called the name of the place taberah : because the fire of the lord burnt among them .
then said saul unto his servants , seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit , that i may go to her , and inquire of her . and his servants said to him , behold , there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at endor .
and the people cried unto moses ; and when moses prayed unto the lord , the fire was quenched .
and when saul inquired of the lord , the lord answered him not , neither by dreams nor by urim , nor by prophets .
we remember the fish , which we did eat in egypt freely ; the cucumbers , and the melons , and the leeks , and the onions , and the garlick :
and when saul saw the host of the philistines , he was afraid , and his heart greatly trembled .
and the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting : and the children of israel also wept again , and said , who shall give us flesh to eat ?
and the manna was as coriander seed , and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium .
but our soul is dried away : there is nothing at all , beside this manna , before our eyes .
and when the dew fell upon the camp in the night , the manna fell upon it .
and the woman said unto him , behold , thou knowest what saul hath done , how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits , and the wizards , out of the land : wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life , to cause me to die ?
and the people went about , and gathered it , and ground it in mills , or beat it in a mortar , and baked it in pans , and made cakes of it : and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil .
and the philistines gathered themselves together , and came and pitched in shunem : and saul gathered all israel together , and they pitched in gilboa .
now samuel was dead , and all israel had lamented him , and buried him in ramah , even in his own city . and saul had put away those that had familiar spirits , and the wizards , out of the land .
and david said to achish , surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do . and achish said to david , therefore will i make thee keeper of mine head for ever .
and when the people complained , it displeased the lord : and the lord heard it ; and his anger was kindled ; and the fire of the lord burnt among them , and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp .
and it came to pass in those days , that the philistines gathered their armies together for warfare , to fight with israel . and achish said unto david , know thou assuredly , that thou shalt go out with me to battle , thou and thy men .
take ye the spoil of silver , take the spoil of gold : for there is none end of the store and glory out of all the pleasant furniture .
he shall recount his worthies : they shall stumble in their walk ; they shall make hast to the wall thereof , and the defence shall be prepared .
the gates of the rivers shall be opened , and the palace shall be dissolved .
and huzzab shall be led away captive , she shall be brought up , and her maids shall lead her as with the voice of doves , tabering upon their breasts .
but nineveh is of old like a pool of water : yet they shall flee away . stand , stand , shall they cry ; but none shall look back .
he that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face : keep the munition , watch the way , make thy loins strong , fortify thy power mightily .
for the lord hath turned away the excellency of jacob , as the excellency of israel : for the emptiers have emptied them out , and marred their vine branches .
the shield of his mighty men is made red , the valiant men are in scarlet : the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his preparation , and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken .
the chariots shall rage in the streets , they shall justle one against another in the broad ways : they shall seem like torches , they shall run like the lightnings .
now in the first year of cyrus king of persia , that the word of the lord spoken by the mouth of jeremiah might be accomplished , the lord stirred up the spirit of cyrus king of persia , that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom , and put it also in writing , saying ,
and them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to babylon ; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of persia :
to fulfil the word of the lord by the mouth of jeremiah , until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths : for as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath , to fulfil threescore and ten years .
be it known now unto the king , that , if this city be builded , and the walls set up again , then will they not pay toll , tribute , and custom , and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings .
be it known unto the king , that the jews which came up from thee to us are come unto jerusalem , building the rebellious and the bad city , and have set up the walls thereof , and joined the foundations .
now because we have maintenance from the king ' s palace , and it was not meet for us to see the king ' s dishonour , therefore have we sent and certified the king ;
then sent the king an answer unto rehum the chancellor , and to shimshai the scribe , and to the rest of their companions that dwell in samaria , and unto the rest beyond the river , peace , and at such a time .
we certify the king that , if this city be builded again , and the walls thereof set up , by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river .
this is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him , even unto artaxerxes the king ; thy servants the men on this side the river , and at such a time .
and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble asnappar brought over , and set in the cities of samaria , and the rest that are on this side the river , and at such a time .
then ceased the work of the house of god which is at jerusalem . so it ceased unto the second year of the reign of darius king of persia .
now when the copy of king artaxerxes ' letter was read before rehum , and shimshai the scribe , and their companions , they went up in haste to jerusalem unto the jews , and made them to cease by force and power .
take heed now that ye fail not to do this : why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings ?
give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease , and that this city be not builded , until another commandment shall be given from me .
there have been mighty kings also over jerusalem , which have ruled over all countries beyond the river ; and toll , tribute , and custom , was paid unto them .
jesus christ the same yesterday , and to day , and for ever .
be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines . for it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace ; not with meats , which have not profited them that have been occupied therein .
so that we may boldly say , the lord is my helper , and i will not fear what man shall do unto me .
let your conversation be without covetousness ; and be content with such things as ye have : for he hath said , i will never leave thee , nor forsake thee .
marriage is honourable in all , and the bed undefiled : but whoremongers and adulterers god will judge .
remember them that are in bonds , as bound with them ; and them which suffer adversity , as being yourselves also in the body .
be not forgetful to entertain strangers : for thereby some have entertained angels unawares .
let brotherly love continue .
then said the prophet jeremiah unto hananiah the prophet , hear now , hananiah ; the lord hath not sent thee ; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie .
for thus saith the lord of hosts , the god of israel ; i have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations , that they may serve nebuchadnezzar king of babylon ; and they shall serve him : and i have given him the beasts of the field also .
so hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month .
therefore thus saith the lord ; behold , i will cast thee from off the face of the earth : this year thou shalt die , because thou hast taught rebellion against the lord .
and hananiah spake in the presence of all the people , saying , thus saith the lord ; even so will i break the yoke of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years . and the prophet jeremiah went his way .
then hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet jeremiah ' s neck , and brake it .
go and tell hananiah , saying , thus saith the lord ; thou hast broken the yokes of wood ; but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron .
then the word of the lord came unto jeremiah the prophet , after that hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet jeremiah , saying ,
in that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst .
and they shall wander from sea to sea , and from the north even to the east , they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the lord , and shall not find it .
behold , the days come , saith the lord god , that i will send a famine in the land , not a famine of bread , nor a thirst for water , but of hearing the words of the lord :
and i will turn your feasts into mourning , and all your songs into lamentation ; and i will bring up sackcloth upon all loins , and baldness upon every head ; and i will make it as the mourning of an only son , and the end thereof as a bitter day .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
and the anointing oil , and sweet incense for the holy place : according to all that i have commanded thee shall they do .
and the cloths of service , and the holy garments for aaron the priest , and the garments of his sons , to minister in the priest ' s office ,
wherefore the children of israel shall keep the sabbath , to observe the sabbath throughout their generations , for a perpetual covenant .
six days may work be done ; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest , holy to the lord : whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day , he shall surely be put to death .
ye shall keep the sabbath therefore ; for it is holy unto you : every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death : for whosoever doeth any work therein , that soul shall be cut off from among his people .
they that swear by the sin of samaria , and say , thy god , o dan , liveth ; and , the manner of beer - sheba liveth ; even they shall fall , and never rise up again .
speak thou also unto the children of israel , saying , verily my sabbaths ye shall keep : for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations ; that ye may know that i am the lord that doth sanctify you .
and he gave unto moses , when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount sinai , two tables of testimony , tables of stone , written with the finger of god .
it is a sign between me and the children of israel for ever : for in six days the lord made heaven and earth , and on the seventh day he rested , and was refreshed .
as the lord commanded moses , so he numbered them in the wilderness of sinai .
of the children of joseph : of ephraim ; elishama the son of ammihud : of manasseh ; gamaliel the son of pedahzur .
of benjamin ; abidan the son of gideoni .
of dan ; ahiezer the son of ammishaddai .
of asher ; pagiel the son of ocran .
of naphtali ; ahira the son of enan .
these were the renowned of the congregation , princes of the tribes of their fathers , heads of thousands in israel .
and moses and aaron took these men which are expressed by their names :
and what nation is there so great , that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law , which i set before you this day ?
only take heed to thyself , and keep thy soul diligently , lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen , and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life : but teach them thy sons , and thy sons ' sons ;
keep therefore and do them ; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations , which shall hear all these statutes , and say , surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people .
for what nation is there so great , who hath god so nigh unto them , as the lord our god is in all things that we call upon him for ?
but ye that did cleave unto the lord your god are alive every one of you this day .
behold , i have taught you statutes and judgments , even as the lord my god commanded me , that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it .
ye shall not add unto the word which i command you , neither shall ye diminish ought from it , that ye may keep the commandments of the lord your god which i command you .
your eyes have seen what the lord did because of baal - peor : for all the men that followed baal - peor , the lord thy god hath destroyed them from among you .
now therefore hearken , o israel , unto the statutes and unto the judgments , which i teach you , for to do them , that ye may live , and go in and possess the land which the lord god of your fathers giveth you .
those that were numbered of them , even of the tribe of issachar , were fifty and four thousand and four hundred .
so then death worketh in us , but life in you .
for we which live are alway delivered unto death for jesus ' sake , that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh .
always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus , that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our body .
for which cause we faint not ; but though our outward man perish , yet the inward man is renewed day by day .
those that were numbered of them , even of the tribe of simeon , were fifty and nine thousand and three hundred .
for all things are for your sakes , that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of god .
of the children of gad , by their generations , after their families , by the house of their fathers , according to the number of the names , from twenty years old and upward , all that were able to go forth to war ;
knowing that he which raised up the lord jesus shall raise up us also by jesus , and shall present us with you .
those that were numbered of them , even of the tribe of reuben , were forty and six thousand and five hundred .
we having the same spirit of faith , according as it is written , i believed , and therefore have i spoken ; we also believe , and therefore speak ;
of the children of simeon , by their generations , after their families , by the house of their fathers , those that were numbered of them , according to the number of the names , by their polls , every male from twenty years old and upward , all that were able to go forth to war ;
those that were numbered of them , even of the tribe of judah , were threescore and fourteen thousand and six hundred .
of the children of issachar , by their generations , after their families , by the house of their fathers , according to the number of the names , from twenty years old and upward , all that were able to go forth to war ;
while we look not at the things which are seen , but at the things which are not seen : for the things which are seen are temporal ; but the things which are not seen are eternal .
those that were numbered of them , even of the tribe of gad , were forty and five thousand six hundred and fifty .
for our light affliction , which is but for a moment , worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory ;
of the children of judah , by their generations , after their families , by the house of their fathers , according to the number of the names , from twenty years old and upward , all that were able to go forth to war ;
and the children of reuben , israel ' s eldest son , by their generations , after their families , by the house of their fathers , according to the number of the names , by their polls , every male from twenty years old and upward , all that were able to go forth to war ;
of the children of benjamin , by their generations , after their families , by the house of their fathers , according to the number of the names , from twenty years old and upward , all that were able to go forth to war ;
those that were numbered of them , even of the tribe of benjamin , were thirty and five thousand and four hundred .
of the children of dan , by their generations , after their families , by the house of their fathers , according to the number of the names , from twenty years old and upward , all that were able to go forth to war ;
those that were numbered of them , even of the tribe of dan , were threescore and two thousand and seven hundred .
of the children of joseph , namely , of the children of ephraim , by their generations , after their families , by the house of their fathers , according to the number of the names , from twenty years old and upward , all that were able to go forth to war ;
those that were numbered of them , even of the tribe of ephraim , were forty thousand and five hundred .
of the children of manasseh , by their generations , after their families , by the house of their fathers , according to the number of the names , from twenty years old and upward , all that were able to go forth to war ;
those that were numbered of them , even of the tribe of manasseh , were thirty and two thousand and two hundred .
those that were numbered of them , even of the tribe of zebulun , were fifty and seven thousand and four hundred .
of the children of zebulun , by their generations , after their families , by the house of their fathers , according to the number of the names , from twenty years old and upward , all that were able to go forth to war ;
but the levites after the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them .
for the lord had spoken unto moses , saying ,
so were all those that were numbered of the children of israel , by the house of their fathers , from twenty years old and upward , all that were able to go forth to war in israel ;
even all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty .
those that were numbered of them , even of the tribe of naphtali , were fifty and three thousand and four hundred .
these are those that were numbered , which moses and aaron numbered , and the princes of israel , being twelve men : each one was for the house of his fathers .
of the children of naphtali , throughout their generations , after their families , by the house of their fathers , according to the number of the names , from twenty years old and upward , all that were able to go forth to war ;
of the children of asher , by their generations , after their families , by the house of their fathers , according to the number of the names , from twenty years old and upward , all that were able to go forth to war ;
they also that seek after my life lay snares for me : and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things , and imagine deceits all the day long .
but i , as a deaf man , heard not ; and i was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth .
my heart panteth , my strength faileth me : as for the light of mine eyes , it also is gone from me .
and jeremiah said unto the house of the rechabites , thus saith the lord of hosts , the god of israel ; because ye have obeyed the commandment of jonadab your father , and kept all his precepts , and done according unto all that he hath commanded you :
my lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore ; and my kinsmen stand afar off .
therefore thus saith the lord of hosts , the god of israel ; jonadab the son of rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever .
and the children of israel shall pitch their tents , every man by his own camp , and every man by his own standard , throughout their hosts .
but the levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony , that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of israel : and the levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony .
but thou shalt appoint the levites over the tabernacle of testimony , and over all the vessels thereof , and over all things that belong to it : they shall bear the tabernacle , and all the vessels thereof ; and they shall minister unto it , and shall encamp round about the tabernacle .
and when the tabernacle setteth forward , the levites shall take it down : and when the tabernacle is to be pitched , the levites shall set it up : and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death .
then they cry unto the lord in their trouble , and he bringeth them out of their distresses .
he maketh the storm a calm , so that the waves thereof are still .
and the children of israel did according to all that the lord commanded moses , so did they .
he sent his word , and healed them , and delivered them from their destructions .
thus saith the lord of hosts , the god of israel ; go and tell the men of judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem , will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words ? saith the lord .
oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness , and for his wonderful works to the children of men !
then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah , saying ,
but mine enemies are lively , and they are strong : and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied .
and let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving , and declare his works with rejoicing .
but it came to pass , when nebuchadrezzar king of babylon came up into the land , that we said , come , and let us go to jerusalem for fear of the army of the chaldeans , and for fear of the army of the syrians : so we dwell at jerusalem .
for i will declare mine iniquity ; i will be sorry for my sin .
they that go down to the sea in ships , that do business in great waters ;
but we have dwelt in tents , and have obeyed , and done according to all that jonadab our father commanded us .
for i am ready to halt , and my sorrow is continually before me .
these see the works of the lord , and his wonders in the deep .
for i said , hear me , lest otherwise they should rejoice over me : when my foot slippeth , they magnify themselves against me .
for he commandeth , and raiseth the stormy wind , which lifteth up the waves thereof .
they mount up to the heaven , they go down again to the depths : their soul is melted because of trouble .
thus i was as a man that heareth not , and in whose mouth are no reproofs .
they reel to and fro , and stagger like a drunken man , and are at their wits ' end .
the words of jonadab the son of rechab , that he commanded his sons not to drink wine , are performed ; for unto this day they drink none , but obey their father ' s commandment : notwithstanding i have spoken unto you , rising early and speaking ; but ye hearkened not unto me .
then are they glad because they be quiet ; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven .
and the priest shall value it , whether it be good or bad : as thou valuest it , who art the priest , so shall it be .
and if it be any unclean beast , of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the lord , then he shall present the beast before the priest :
and when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the lord , then the priest shall estimate it , whether it be good or bad : as the priest shall estimate it , so shall it stand .
but if he will at all redeem it , then he shall add a fifth part thereof unto thy estimation .
he shall not alter it , nor change it , a good for a bad , or a bad for a good : and if he shall at all change beast for beast , then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy .
and if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it , then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it , and it shall be assured to him .
again , they are minished and brought low through oppression , affliction , and sorrow .
and if he that sanctified it will redeem his house , then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it , and it shall be his .
and if a man shall sanctify unto the lord some part of a field of his possession , then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof : an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver .
if he sanctify his field from the year of jubile , according to thy estimation it shall stand .
but if he sanctify his field after the jubile , then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain , even unto the year of the jubile , and it shall be abated from thy estimation .
he turneth rivers into a wilderness , and the watersprings into dry ground ;
a fruitful land into barrenness , for the wickedness of them that dwell therein .
oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness , and for his wonderful works to the children of men !
let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people , and praise him in the assembly of the elders .
and sow the fields , and plant vineyards , which may yield fruits of increase .
he blesseth them also , so that they are multiplied greatly ; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease .
he turneth the wilderness into a standing water , and dry ground into watersprings .
and there he maketh the hungry to dwell , that they may prepare a city for habitation ;
but the field , when it goeth out in the jubile , shall be holy unto the lord , as a field devoted ; the possession thereof shall be the priest ' s .
and if he will not redeem the field , or if he have sold the field to another man , it shall not be redeemed any more .
and all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary : twenty gerahs shall be the shekel .
in the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought , even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong .
and if a man sanctify unto the lord a field which he hath bought , which is not of the fields of his possession ;
notwithstanding no devoted thing , that a man shall devote unto the lord of all that he hath , both of man and beast , and of the field of his possession , shall be sold or redeemed : every devoted thing is most holy unto the lord .
only the firstling of the beasts , which should be the lord ' s firstling , no man shall sanctify it ; whether it be ox , or sheep : it is the lord ' s .
and if it be of an unclean beast , then he shall redeem it according to thine estimation , and shall add a fifth part of it thereto : or if it be not redeemed , then it shall be sold according to thy estimation .
and all the tithe of the land , whether of the seed of the land , or of the fruit of the tree , is the lord ' s : it is holy unto the lord .
and concerning the tithe of the herd , or of the flock , even of whatsoever passeth under the rod , the tenth shall be holy unto the lord .
and if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes , he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof .
these are the commandments , which the lord commanded moses for the children of israel in mount sinai .
he shall not search whether it be good or bad , neither shall he change it : and if he change it at all , then both it and the change thereof shall be holy ; it shall not be redeemed .
then they cry unto the lord in their trouble , and he saveth them out of their distresses .
fools because of their transgression , and because of their iniquities , are afflicted .
their soul abhorreth all manner of meat ; and they draw near unto the gates of death .
oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness , and for his wonderful works to the children of men !
for he hath broken the gates of brass , and cut the bars of iron in sunder .
then they cried unto the lord in their trouble , and he saved them out of their distresses .
he brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death , and brake their bands in sunder .
because they rebelled against the words of god , and contemned the counsel of the most high :
therefore he brought down their heart with labour ; they fell down , and there was none to help .
such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death , being bound in affliction and iron ;
and he spake also unto the men of penuel , saying , when i come again in peace , i will break down this tower .
and he went up thence to penuel , and spake unto them likewise : and the men of penuel answered him as the men of succoth had answered him .
and gideon said , therefore when the lord hath delivered zebah and zalmunna into mine hand , then i will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers .
but when thou doest alms , let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth :
and the princes of succoth said , are the hands of zebah and zalmunna now in thine hand , that we should give bread unto thine army ?
be not ye therefore like unto them : for your father knoweth what things ye have need of , before ye ask him .
and he said unto the men of succoth , give , i pray you , loaves of bread unto the people that follow me ; for they be faint , and i am pursuing after zebah and zalmunna , kings of midian .
after this manner therefore pray ye : our father which art in heaven , hallowed be thy name .
and gideon came to jordan , and passed over , he , and the three hundred men that were with him , faint , yet pursuing them .
but thou , when thou prayest , enter into thy closet , and when thou hast shut thy door , pray to thy father which is in secret ; and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly .
god hath delivered into your hands the princes of midian , oreb and zeeb : and what was i able to do in comparison of you ? then their anger was abated toward him , when he had said that .
but when ye pray , use not vain repetitions , as the heathen do : for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking .
and the men of ephraim said unto him , why hast thou served us thus , that thou calledst us not , when thou wentest to fight with the midianites ? and they did chide with him sharply .
say not unto thy neighbour , go , and come again , and to morrow i will give ; when thou hast it by thee .
and he said unto them , what have i done now in comparison of you ? is not the gleaning of the grapes of ephraim better than the vintage of abi - ezer ?
devise not evil against thy neighbour , seeing he dwelleth securely by thee .
lo , mine eye hath seen all this , mine ear hath heard and understood it .
for the lord shall be thy confidence , and shall keep thy foot from being taken .
what ye know , the same do i know also : i am not inferior unto you .
withhold not good from them to whom it is due , when it is in the power of thine hand to do it .
surely i would speak to the almighty , and i desire to reason with god .
when thou liest down , thou shalt not be afraid : yea , thou shalt lie down , and thy sleep shall be sweet .
but ye are forgers of lies , ye are all physicians of no value .
be not afraid of sudden fear , neither of the desolation of the wicked , when it cometh .
o that ye would altogether hold your peace ! and it should be your wisdom .
so shall they be life unto thy soul , and grace to thy neck .
hear now my reasoning , and hearken to the pleadings of my lips .
then shalt thou walk in thy way safely , and thy foot shall not stumble .
will ye speak wickedly for god ? and talk deceitfully for him ?
by his knowledge the depths are broken up , and the clouds drop down the dew .
will ye accept his person ? will ye contend for god ?
my son , let not them depart from thine eyes : keep sound wisdom and discretion :
is it good that he should search you out ? or as one man mocketh another , do ye so mock him ?
the lord by wisdom hath founded the earth ; by understanding hath he established the heavens .
she is more precious than rubies : and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her .
her ways are ways of pleasantness , and all her paths are peace .
the is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her : and happy is every one that retaineth her .
my son , despise not the chastening of the lord ; neither be weary of his correction :
for whom the lord loveth he correcteth ; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth .
happy is the man that findeth wisdom , and the man that getteth understanding .
for the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver , and the gain thereof than fine gold .
so shall thy barns be filled with plenty , and thy presses shall burst out with new wine .
these things write i unto thee , hoping to come unto thee shortly :
but if i tarry long , that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of god , which is the church of the living god , the pillar and ground of the truth .
let the deacons be the husbands of one wife , ruling their children and their own houses well .
for they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree , and great boldness in the faith which is in christ jesus .
and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness : god was manifest in the flesh , justified in the spirit , seen of angels , preached unto the gentiles , believed on in the world , received up into glory .
and when he was gone out into the porch , another maid saw him , and said unto them that were there , this fellow was also with jesus of nazareth .
and again he denied with an oath , i do not know the man .
he poureth contempt upon princes , and causeth them to wander in the wilderness , where there is no way .
yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction , and maketh him families like a flock .
but he denied before them all , saying , i know not what thou sayest .
and peter remembered the word of jesus , which said unto him , before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice . and he went out , and wept bitterly .
and after a while came unto him they that stood by , and said to peter , surely thou also art one of them ; for thy speech bewrayeth thee .
then began he to curse and to swear , saying , i know not the man . and immediately the cock crew .
the righteous shall see it , and rejoice : and all iniquity shall stop her mouth .
even so must their wives be grave , not slanderers , sober , faithful in all things .
and let these also first be proved ; then let them use the office of a deacon , being found blameless .
they also that render evil for good are mine adversaries ; because i follow the thing that good is .
make haste to help me , o lord my salvation .
forsake me not , o lord : o my god , be not far from me .
the curse of the lord is in the house of the wicked : but he blesseth the habitation of the just .
surely he scorneth the scorners : but he giveth grace unto the lowly .
the wise shall inherit glory : but shame shall be the promotion of fools .
take heed that ye do not your alms before men , to be seen of them : otherwise ye have no reward of your father which is in heaven .
strive not with a man without cause , if he have done thee no harm .
envy thou not the oppressor , and choose none of his ways .
for the froward is abomination to the lord : but his secret is with the righteous .
and certain men which came down from judaea taught the brethren , and said , except ye be circumcised after the manner of moses , ye cannot be saved .
saying , prophesy unto us , thou christ , who is he that smote thee ?
now peter sat without in the palace : and a damsel came unto him , saying , thou also wast with jesus of galilee .
what think ye ? they answered and said , he is guilty of death .
then did they spit in his face , and buffeted him ; and others smote him with the palms of their hands ,
but found none : yea , though many false witnesses came , yet found they none . at the last came two false witnesses ,
then the high priest rent his clothes , saying , he hath spoken blasphemy ; what further need have we of witnesses ? behold , now ye have heard his blasphemy .
but jesus held his peace . and the high priest answered and said unto him , i adjure thee by the living god , that thou tell us whether thou be the christ , the son of god .
and the high priest arose , and said unto him , answerest thou nothing ? what is it which these witness against thee ?
and god , which knoweth the hearts , bare them witness , giving them the holy ghost , even as he did unto us ;
and put no difference between us and them , purifying their hearts by faith .
and the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter .
and when there had been much disputing , peter rose up , and said unto them , men and brethren , ye know how that a good while ago god made choice among us , that the gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel , and believe .
and when they were come to jerusalem , they were received of the church , and of the apostles and elders , and they declared all things that god had done with them .
but there rose up certain of the sect of the pharisees which believed , saying , that it was needful to circumcise them , and to command them to keep the law of moses .
when therefore paul and barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them , they determined that paul and barnabas , and certain other of them , should go up to jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question .
and being brought on their way by the church , they passed through phenice and samaria , declaring the conversion of the gentiles : and they caused great joy unto all the brethren .
wherefore he said unto the messengers of ben - hadad , tell my lord the king , all that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first i will do : but this thing i may not do . and the messengers departed , and brought him word again .
yet i will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time , and they shall search thine house , and the houses of thy servants ; and it shall be , that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes , they shall put it in their hand , and take it away .
and the messengers came again , and said , thus speaketh ben - hadad , saying , although i have sent unto thee , saying , thou shalt deliver me thy silver , and thy gold , and thy wives , and thy children ;
and all the elders and all the people said unto him , hearken not unto him , nor consent .
in that same hour said jesus to the multitudes , are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me ? i sat daily with you teaching in the temple , and ye laid no hold on me .
but all this was done , that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled . then all the disciples forsook him , and fled .
and they that had laid hold on jesus led him away to caiaphas the high priest , where the scribes and the elders were assembled .
but peter followed him afar off unto the high priest ' s palace , and went in , and sat with the servants , to see the end .
now the chief priests , and elders , and all the council , sought false witness against jesus , to put him to death ;
and jesus said unto him , friend , wherefore art thou come ? then came they , and laid hands on jesus , and took him .
then said jesus unto him , put up again thy sword into his place : for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword .
and , behold , one of them which were with jesus stretched out his hand , and drew his sword , and struck a servant of the high priest ' s , and smote off his ear .
but how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled , that thus it must be ?
thinkest thou that i cannot now pray to my father , and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels ?
and ben - hadad the king of syria gathered all his host together : and there were thirty and two kings with him , and horses , and chariots : and he went up and besieged samaria , and warred against it .
and he sent messengers to ahab king of israel into the city , and said unto him , thus saith ben - hadad ,
thy silver and thy gold is mine ; thy wives also and thy children , even the goodliest , are mine .
and the king of israel answered and said , my lord , o king , according to thy saying , i am thine , and all that i have .
now he that betrayed him gave them a sign , saying , whomsoever i shall kiss , that same is he : hold him fast .
and forthwith he came to jesus , and said , hail , master ; and kissed him .
rise , let us be going : behold , he is at hand that doth betray me .
and while he yet spake , lo , judas , one of the twelve , came , and with him a great multitude with swords and staves , from the chief priests and elders of the people .
and he left them , and went away again , and prayed the third time , saying the same words .
then cometh he to his disciples , and saith unto them , sleep on now , and take your rest : behold , the hour is at hand , and the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
and he came and found them asleep again : for their eyes were heavy .
he went away again the second time , and prayed , saying , o my father , if this cup may not pass away from me , except i drink it , thy will be done .
watch and pray , that ye enter not into temptation : the spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak .
and he cometh unto the disciples , and findeth them asleep , and saith unto peter , what , could ye not watch with me one hour ?
and he took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee , and began to be sorrowful and very heavy .
then saith he unto them , my soul is exceeding sorrowful , even unto death : tarry ye here , and watch with me .
and he went a little further , and fell on his face , and prayed , saying , o my father , if it be possible , let this cup pass from me : nevertheless not as i will , but as thou wilt .
jesus said unto him , verily i say unto thee , that this night , before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice .
peter said unto him , though i should die with thee , yet will i not deny thee . likewise also said all the disciples .
then cometh jesus with them unto a place called gethsemane , and saith unto the disciples , sit ye here , while i go and pray yonder .
and when they had sung an hymn , they went out into the mount of olives .
but after i am risen again , i will go before you into galilee .
then saith jesus unto them , all ye shall be offended because of me this night : for it is written , i will smite the shepherd , and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad .
then judas , which betrayed him , answered and said , master , is it i ? he said unto him , thou hast said .
the son of man goeth as it is written of him : but woe unto that man by whom the son of man is betrayed ! it had been good for that man if he had not been born .
and he answered and said , he that dippeth his hand with me in the dish , the same shall betray me .
and they were exceeding sorrowful , and began every one of them to say unto him , lord , is it i ?
then achish gave him ziklag that day : wherefore ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of judah unto this day .
but i say unto you , i will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine , until that day when i drink it new with you in my father ' s kingdom .
and the time that david dwelt in the country of the philistines was a full year and four months .
for this is my blood of the new testament , which is shed for many for the remission of sins .
and david and his men went up , and invaded the geshurites , and the gezrites , and the amalekites : for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land , as thou goest to shur , even unto the land of egypt .
and he took the cup , and gave thanks , and gave it to them , saying , drink ye all of it ;
and david smote the land , and left neither man nor woman alive , and took away the sheep , and the oxen , and the asses , and the camels , and the apparel , and returned , and came to achish .
and as they were eating , jesus took bread , and blessed it , and brake it , and gave it to the disciples , and said , take , eat ; this is my body .
and david arose , and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto achish , the son of maoch , king of gath .
and david dwelt with achish at gath , he and his men , every man with his household , even david with his two wives , ahinoam the jezreelitess , and abigail the carmelitess , nabal ' s wife .
and it was told saul that david was fled to gath : and he sought no more again for him .
and david said unto achish , if i have now found grace in thine eyes , let them give me a place in some town in the country , that i may dwell there : for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee ?
now when the even was come , he sat down with the twelve .
and as they did eat , he said , verily i say unto you , that one of you shall betray me .
for in that she hath poured this ointment on my body , she did it for my burial .
for ye have the poor always with you ; but me ye have not always .
then one of the twelve , called judas iscariot , went unto the chief priests ,
verily i say unto you , wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world , there shall also this , that this woman hath done , be told for a memorial of her .
and from that time he sought opportunity to betray him .
and said unto them , what will ye give me , and i will deliver him unto you ? and they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver .
and he said , go into the city to such a man , and say unto him , the master saith , my time is at hand ; i will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples .
now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to jesus , saying unto him , where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover ?
and the disciples did as jesus had appointed them ; and they made ready the passover .
remove not the old landmark ; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless :
and ram begat amminadab ; and amminadab begat nahshon , prince of the children of judah ;
when jesus understood it , he said unto them , why trouble ye the woman ? for she hath wrought a good work upon me .
hear thou , my son , and be wise , and guide thine heart in the way .
for surely there is an end ; and thine expectation shall not be cut off .
let not thine heart envy sinners : but be thou in the fear of the lord all the day long .
yea , my reins shall rejoice , when thy lips speak right things .
my son , if thine heart be wise , my heart shall rejoice , even mine .
thou shalt beat him with the rod , and shalt deliver his soul from hell .
withhold not correction from the child : for if thou beatest him with the rod , he shall not die .
but if thou wilt go , do it , be strong for the battle : god shall make thee fall before the enemy : for god hath power to help , and to cast down .
apply thine heart unto instruction , and thine ears to the words of knowledge .
and amaziah said to the man of god , but what shall we do for the hundred talents which i have given to the army of israel ? and the man of god answered , the lord is able to give thee much more than this .
for their redeemer is mighty ; he shall plead their cause with thee .
but there came a man of god to him , saying , o king , let not the army of israel go with thee ; for the lord is not with israel , to wit , with all the children of ephraim .
be not among winebibbers ; among riotous eaters of flesh :
he hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of israel for an hundred talents of silver .
for the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty : and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags .
but he slew not their children , but did as it is written in the law in the book of moses , where the lord commanded , saying , the fathers shall not die for the children , neither shall the children die for the fathers , but every man shall die for his own sin .
now it came to pass , when the kingdom was established to him , that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord , but not with a perfect heart .
amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and he reigned twenty and nine years in jerusalem . and his mother ' s name was jehoaddan of jerusalem .
thou hast laid me in the lowest pit , in darkness , in the deeps .
thy wrath lieth hard upon me , and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves . selah .
thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me ; thou hast made me an abomination unto them : i am shut up , and i cannot come forth .
mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction : lord , i have called daily upon thee , i have stretched out my hands unto thee .
let my prayer come before thee : incline thine ear unto my cry ;
for my soul is full of troubles : and my life draweth nigh unto the grave .
i am counted with them that go down into the pit : i am as a man that hath no strength :
free among the dead , like the slain that lie in the grave , whom thou rememberest no more : and they are cut off from thy hand .
o lord god of my salvation , i have cried day and night before thee :
for a whore is a deep ditch ; and a strange woman is a narrow pit .
my son , give me thine heart , and let thine eyes observe my ways .
who hath woe ? who hath sorrow ? who hath contentions ? who hath babbling ? who hath wounds without cause ? who hath redness of eyes ?
she also lieth in wait as for a prey , and increaseth the transgressors among men .
buy the truth , and sell it not ; also wisdom , and instruction , and understanding .
hearken unto thy father that begat thee , and despise not thy mother when she is old .
they that tarry long at the wine ; they that go to seek mixed wine .
at the last it biteth like a serpent , and stingeth like an adder .
and he shall burn all his fat upon the altar , as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings : and the priest shall make an atonement for him as concerning his sin , and it shall be forgiven him .
and the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger , and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering , and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat , and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the lord : it is a sin offering .
or if his sin , wherein he hath sinned , come to his knowledge ; he shall bring his offering , a kid of the goats , a male without blemish :
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering , and slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering .
o that they were wise , that they understood this , that they would consider their latter end !
or if his sin , which he hath sinned , come to his knowledge : then he shall bring his offering , a kid of the goats , a female without blemish , for his sin which he hath sinned .
and if any one of the common people sin through ignorance , while he doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the lord concerning things which ought not to be done , and be guilty ;
when a ruler hath sinned , and done somewhat through ignorance against any of the commandments of the lord his god concerning things which should not be done , and is guilty ;
and he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp , and burn him as he burned the first bullock : it is a sin offering for the congregation .
and he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin offering , so shall he do with this : and the priest shall make an atonement for them , and it shall be forgiven them .
and he said , i will hide my face from them , i will see what their end shall be : for they are a very froward generation , children in whom is no faith .
and there they abode long time with the disciples .
and when they were come , and had gathered the church together , they rehearsed all that god had done with them , and how he had opened the door of faith unto the gentiles .
and thence sailed to antioch , from whence they had been recommended to the grace of god for the work which they fulfilled .
the sword without , and terror within , shall destroy both the young man and the virgin , the suckling also with the man of gray hairs .
and when they had preached the word in perga , they went down into attalia :
i said , i would scatter them into corners , i would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men :
and after they had passed throughout pisidia , they came to pamphylia .
were it not that i feared the wrath of the enemy , lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely , and lest they should say , our hand is high , and the lord hath not done all this .
and when they had ordained them elders in every church , and had prayed with fasting , they commended them to the lord , on whom they believed .
for they are a nation void of counsel , neither is there any understanding in them .
confirming the souls of the disciples , and exhorting them to continue in the faith , and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of god .
they have moved me to jealousy with that which is not god ; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities : and i will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people ; i will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation .
and when they had preached the gospel to that city , and had taught many , they returned again to lystra , and to iconium , and antioch ,
for a fire is kindled in mine anger , and shall burn unto the lowest hell , and shall consume the earth with her increase , and set on fire the foundations of the mountains .
howbeit , as the disciples stood round about him , he rose up , and came into the city : and the next day he departed with barnabas to derbe .
i will heap mischiefs upon them ; i will spend mine arrows upon them .
they shall be burnt with hunger , and devoured with burning heat , and with bitter destruction : i will also send the teeth of beasts upon them , with the poison of serpents of the dust .
and the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger , and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering , and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar :
and when the lord saw it , he abhorred them , because of the provoking of his sons , and of his daughters .
of the rock that begat thee thou art unmindful , and hast forgotten god that formed thee .
and he shall take away all the fat thereof , as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings ; and the priest shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the lord ; and the priest shall make an atonement for him , and it shall be forgiven him .
and the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger , and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering , and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering , and slay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt offering
and if he bring a lamb for a sin offering , he shall bring it a female without blemish .
nevertheless he left not himself without witness , in that he did good , and gave us rain from heaven , and fruitful seasons , filling our hearts with food and gladness .
who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways .
and there came thither certain jews from antioch and iconium , who persuaded the people , and , having stoned paul , drew him out of the city , supposing he had been dead .
and with these sayings scarce restrained they the people , that they had not done sacrifice unto them .
then the priest of jupiter , which was before their city , brought oxen and garlands unto the gates , and would have done sacrifice with the people .
they provoked him to jealousy with strange gods , with abominations provoked they him to anger .
and they called barnabas , jupiter ; and paul , mercurius , because he was the chief speaker .
they sacrificed unto devils , not to god ; to gods whom they knew not , to new gods that came newly up , whom your fathers feared not .
and saying , sirs , why do ye these things ? we also are men of like passions with you , and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living god , which made heaven , and earth , and the sea , and all things that are therein :
butter of kine , and milk of sheep , with fat of lambs , and rams of the breed of bashan , and goats , with the fat of kidneys of wheat ; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape .
but jeshurun waxed fat , and kicked : thou art waxen fat , thou art grown thick , thou art covered with fatness ; then he forsook god which made him , and lightly esteemed the rock of his salvation .
he made him ride on the high places of the earth , that he might eat the increase of the fields ; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock , and oil out of the flinty rock ;
and when the people saw what paul had done , they lifted up their voices , saying in the speech of lycaonia , the gods are come down to us in the likeness of men .
he found him in a desert land , and in the waste howling wilderness ; he led him about , he instructed him , he kept him as the apple of his eye .
said with a loud voice , stand upright on thy feet . and he leaped and walked .
as an eagle stirreth up her nest , fluttereth over her young , spreadeth abroad her wings , taketh them , beareth them on her wings :
and her father hear her vow , and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul , and her father shall hold his peace at her : then all her vows shall stand , and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand .
if a woman also vow a vow unto the lord , and bind herself by a bond , being in her father ' s house in her youth ;
if a man vow a vow unto the lord , or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond ; he shall not break his word , he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth .
and moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of israel , saying , this is the thing which the lord hath commanded .
for i lift up my hand to heaven , and say , i live for ever .
if i whet my glittering sword , and mine hand take hold on judgment ; i will render vengeance to mine enemies , and will reward them that hate me .
i will make mine arrows drunk with blood , and my sword shall devour flesh ; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives , from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy .
rejoice , o ye nations , with his people : for he will avenge the blood of his servants , and will render vengeance to his adversaries , and will be merciful unto his land , and to his people .
and moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people , he , and hoshea the son of nun .
and moses made an end of speaking all these words to all israel :
but every vow of a widow , and of her that is divorced , wherewith they have bound their souls , shall stand against her .
and he said unto them , set your hearts unto all the words which i testify among you this day , which ye shall command your children to observe to do , all the words of this law .
but if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it ; then he shall make her vow which she vowed , and that which she uttered with her lips , wherewith she bound her soul , of none effect : and the lord shall forgive her .
for it is not a vain thing for you ; because it is your life : and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land , whither ye go over jordan to possess it .
and her husband heard it , and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it : then her vows shall stand , and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand .
and the lord spake unto moses that selfsame day , saying ,
and if she had at all an husband , when she vowed , or uttered ought out of her lips , wherewith she bound her soul ;
get thee up into this mountain abarim , unto mount nebo , which is in the land of moab , that is over against jericho ; and behold the land of canaan , which i give unto the children of israel for a possession :
but if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth ; not any of her vows , or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul , shall stand : and the lord shall forgive her , because her father disallowed her .
and also i have withholden the rain from you , when there were yet three months to the harvest : and i caused it to rain upon one city , and caused it not to rain upon another city : one piece was rained upon , and the piece whereupon it rained not withered .
so two or three cities wandered unto one city , to drink water ; but they were not satisfied : yet have ye not returned unto me , saith the lord .
and offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven , and proclaim and publish the free offerings : for this liketh you , o ye children of israel , saith the lord god .
and i also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities , and want of bread in all your places : yet have ye not returned unto me , saith the lord .
how should one chase a thousand , and two put ten thousand to flight , except their rock had sold them , and the lord had shut them up ?
and ye shall go out at the breaches , every cow at that which is before her ; and ye shall cast them into the palace , saith the lord .
for their rock is not as our rock , even our enemies themselves being judges .
come to bethel , and transgress ; at gilgal multiply transgression ; and bring your sacrifices every morning , and your tithes after three years :
hear this word , ye kine of bashan , that are in the mountain of samaria , which oppress the poor , which crush the needy , which say to their masters , bring , and let us drink .
the lord god hath sworn by his holiness , that , lo , the days shall come upon you , that he will take you away with hooks , and your posterity with fishhooks .
is not this laid up in store with me , and sealed up among my treasures ?
to me belongeth vengeance , and recompence ; their foot shall slide in due time : for the day of their calamity is at hand , and the things that shall come upon them make haste .
for their vine is of the vine of sodom , and of the fields of gomorrah : their grapes are grapes of gall , their clusters are bitter :
their wine is the poison of dragons , and the cruel venom of asps .
which did eat the fat of their sacrifices , and drank the wine of their drink offerings ? let them rise up and help you , and be your protection .
see now that i , even i , am he , and there is no god with me : i kill , and i make alive ; i wound , and i heal : neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand .
for the lord shall judge his people , and repent himself for his servants , when he seeth that their power is gone , and there is none shut up , or left .
i have smitten you with blasting and mildew : when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased , the palmerworm devoured them : yet have ye not returned unto me , saith the lord .
thou lovest righteousness , and hatest wickedness : therefore god , thy god , hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows .
thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king ' s enemies ; whereby the people fall under thee .
thy throne , o god , is for ever and ever : the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre .
gird thy sword upon thy thigh , o most mighty , with thy glory and thy majesty .
my heart is inditing a good matter : i speak of the things which i have made touching the king : my tongue is the pen of a ready writer .
the heavens declare the glory of god ; and the firmament sheweth his handywork .
thou art fairer than the children of men : grace is poured into thy lips : therefore god hath blessed thee for ever .
but i beseech you , that i may not be bold when i am present with that confidence , wherewith i think to be bold against some , which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh .
day unto day uttereth speech , and night unto night sheweth knowledge .
now i paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of christ , who in presence am base among you , but being absent am bold toward you :
there is no speech nor language , where their voice is not heard .
their line is gone out through all the earth , and their words to the end of the world . in them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun ,
which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber , and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race .
his going forth is from the end of the heaven , and his circuit unto the ends of it : and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof .
the law of the lord is perfect , converting the soul : the testimony of the lord is sure , making wise the simple .
the statutes of the lord are right , rejoicing the heart : the commandment of the lord is pure , enlightening the eyes .
kings ' daughters were among thy honourable women : upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of ophir .
the fear of the lord is clean , enduring for ever : the judgments of the lord are true and righteous altogether .
yet thou shalt see the land before thee ; but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which i give the children of israel .
because ye trespassed against me among the children of israel at the waters of meribah - kadesh , in the wilderness of zin ; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of israel .
and die in the mount whither thou goest up , and be gathered unto thy people ; as aaron thy brother died in mount hor , and was gathered unto his people :
who forgiveth all thine iniquities ; who healeth all thy diseases ;
bless the lord , o my soul , and forget not all his benefits :
who satisfieth thy mouth with good things ; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle ' s .
who redeemeth thy life from destruction ; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies ;
mine eyes do fail with tears , my bowels are troubled , my liver is poured upon the earth , for the destruction of the daughter of my people ; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city .
they say to their mothers , where is corn and wine ? when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city , when their soul was poured out into their mothers ' bosom .
bless the lord , o my soul : and all that is within me , bless his holy name .
the elders of the daughter of zion sit upon the ground , and keep silence : they have cast up dust upon their heads ; they have girded themselves with sackcloth : the virgins of jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground .
thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee : and they have not discovered thine iniquity , to turn away thy captivity ; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment .
what thing shall i take to witness for thee ? what thing shall i liken to thee , o daughter of jerusalem ? what shall i equal to thee , that i may comfort thee , o virgin daughter of zion ? for thy breach is great like the sea : who can heal thee ?
as it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings : and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of the burnt offering .
all thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee : they hiss and gnash the teeth : they say , we have swallowed her up : certainly this is the day that we looked for ; we have found , we have seen it .
and the skin of the bullock , and all his flesh , with his head , and with his legs , and his inwards , and his dung ,
all that pass by clap their hands at thee ; they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of jerusalem , saying , is this the city that men call the perfection of beauty , the joy of the whole earth ?
the lord is merciful and gracious , slow to anger , and plenteous in mercy .
their heart cried unto the lord , o wall of the daughter of zion , let tears run down like a river day and night : give thyself no rest ; let not the apple of thine eye cease .
he will not always chide : neither will he keep his anger for ever .
the lord hath done that which he had devised ; he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old : he hath thrown down , and hath not pitied : and he hath caused thine enemy to rejoice over thee , he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries .
the lord executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed .
he made known his ways unto moses , his acts unto the children of israel .
arise , cry out in the night : in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the lord : lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children , that faint for hunger in the top of every street .
and the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock ' s blood to the tabernacle of the congregation :
and the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood , and sprinkle it seven times before the lord , even before the vail .
and he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar which is before the lord , that is in the tabernacle of the congregation , and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering , which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
and he shall take all his fat from him , and burn it upon the altar .
even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place , where the ashes are poured out , and burn him on the wood with fire : where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt .
and if the whole congregation of israel sin through ignorance , and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly , and they have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the lord concerning things which should not be done , and are guilty ;
when the sin , which they have sinned against it , is known , then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin , and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation .
and the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before the lord : and the bullock shall be killed before the lord .
behold , o lord , and consider to whom thou hast done this . shall the women eat their fruit , and children of a span long ? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the lord ?
the young and the old lie on the ground in the streets : my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword ; thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger ; thou hast killed , and not pitied .
thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about , so that in the day of the lord ' s anger none escaped nor remained : those that i have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed .
( which hermon the sidonians call sirion ; and the amorites call it shenir ; )
and we took all his cities at that time , there was not a city which we took not from them , threescore cities , all the region of argob , the kingdom of og in bashan .
so the lord our god delivered into our hands og also , the king of bashan , and all his people : and we smote him until none was left to him remaining .
and the lord said unto me , fear him not : for i will deliver him , and all his people , and his land , into thy hand ; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto sihon king of the amorites , which dwelt at heshbon .
then we turned , and went up the way to bashan : and og the king of bashan came out against us , he and all his people , to battle at edrei .
and we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the amorites the land that was on this side jordan , from the river of arnon unto mount hermon ;
but all the cattle , and the spoil of the cities , we took for a prey to ourselves .
and we utterly destroyed them , as we did unto sihon king of heshbon , utterly destroying the men , women , and children , of every city .
all these cities were fenced with high walls , gates , and bars ; beside unwalled towns a great many .
he hath made the earth by his power , he hath established the world by his wisdom , and hath stretched out the heaven by his understanding .
the lord of hosts hath sworn by himself , saying , surely i will fill thee with men , as with caterpillers ; and they shall lift up a shout against thee .
o thou that dwellest upon many waters , abundant in treasures , thine end is come , and the measure of thy covetousness .
set up the standard upon the walls of babylon , make the watch strong , set up the watchmen , prepare the ambushes : for the lord hath both devised and done that which he spake against the inhabitants of babylon .
the portion of jacob is not like them ; for he is the former of all things : and israel is the rod of his inheritance : the lord of hosts is his name .
they are vanity , the work of errors : in the time of their visitation they shall perish .
every man is brutish by his knowledge ; every founder is confounded by the graven image : for his molten image is falsehood , and there is no breath in them .
when he uttereth his voice , there is a multitude of waters in the heavens ; and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth : he maketh lightnings with rain , and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures .
the lord hath brought forth our righteousness : come , and let us declare in zion the work of the lord our god .
make bright the arrows ; gather the shields : the lord hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the medes : for his device is against babylon , to destroy it ; because it is the vengeance of the lord , the vengeance of his temple .
and jesus , when he was baptized , went up straightway out of the water : and , lo , the heavens were opened unto him , and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove , and lighting upon him :
and lo a voice from heaven , saying , this is my beloved son , in whom i am well pleased .
but john forbad him , saying , i have need to be baptized of thee , and comest thou to me ?
and jesus answering said unto him , suffer it to be so now : for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness . then he suffered him .
whose fan is in his hand , and he will throughly purge his floor , and gather his wheat into the garner ; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire .
then cometh jesus from galilee to jordan unto john , to be baptized of him .
and now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees : therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast into the fire .
i indeed baptize you with water unto repentance : but he that cometh after me is mightier than i , whose shoes i am not worthy to bear : he shall baptize you with the holy ghost , and with fire :
and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake , some to everlasting life , and some to shame and everlasting contempt .
and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament ; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever .
and one said to the man clothed in linen , which was upon the waters of the river , how long shall it be to the end of these wonders ?
then i daniel looked , and , behold , there stood other two , the one on this side of the bank of the river , and the other on that side of the bank of the river .
but thou , o daniel , shut up the words , and seal the book , even to the time of the end : many shall run to and fro , and knowledge shall be increased .
and he said , go thy way , daniel : for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end .
and i heard , but i understood not : then said i , o my lord , what shall be the end of these things ?
but if ye turn away , and forsake my statutes and my commandments , which i have set before you , and shall go and serve other gods , and worship them ;
then will i stablish the throne of thy kingdom , according as i have covenanted with david thy father , saying , there shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in israel .
and as for thee , if thou wilt walk before me , as david thy father walked , and do according to all that i have commanded thee , and shalt observe my statues and my judgments ;
and it shall be answered , because they forsook the lord god of their fathers , which brought them forth out of the land of egypt , and laid hold on other gods , and worshipped them , and served them : therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them .
then will i pluck them up by the roots out of my land which i have given them ; and this house , which i have sanctified for my name , will i cast out of my sight , and will make it to be a proverb and a byword among all nations .
and this house , which is high , shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it ; so that he shall say , why hath the lord done thus unto this land , and unto this house ?
for we write none other things unto you , than what ye read or acknowledge ; and i trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end ;
for our rejoicing is this , the testimony of our conscience , that in simplicity and godly sincerity , not with fleshly wisdom , but by the grace of god , we have had our conversation in the world , and more abundantly to you - ward .
ye also helping together by prayer for us , that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf .
who delivered us from so great a death , and doth deliver : in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us ;
when i therefore was thus minded , did i use lightness ? or the things that i purpose , do i purpose according to the flesh , that with me there should be yea yea , and nay nay ?
and to pass by you into macedonia , and to come again out of macedonia unto you , and of you to be brought on my way toward judaea .
and in this confidence i was minded to come unto you before , that ye might have a second benefit ;
as also ye have acknowledged us in part , that we are your rejoicing , even as ye also are ours in the day of the lord jesus .
and on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents , glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the lord had shewed unto david , and to solomon , and to israel his people .
thus solomon finished the house of the lord , and the king ' s house : and all that came into solomon ' s heart to make in the house of the lord , and in his own house , he prosperously effected .
and the lord appeared to solomon by night , and said unto him , i have heard thy prayer , and have chosen this place to myself for an house of sacrifice .
if i shut up heaven that there be no rain , or if i command the locusts to devour the land , or if i send pestilence among my people ;
if my people , which are called by my name , shall humble themselves , and pray , and seek my face , and turn from their wicked ways ; then will i hear from heaven , and will forgive their sin , and will heal their land .
now mine eyes shall be open , and mine ears attent unto the prayer that is made in this place .
for now have i chosen and sanctified this house , that my name may be there for ever : and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually .
but as god is true , our word toward you was not yea and nay .
for the son of god , jesus christ , who was preached among you by us , even by me and silvanus and timotheus , was not yea and nay , but in him was yea .
who hath also sealed us , and given the earnest of the spirit in our hearts .
now he which stablisheth us with you in christ , and hath anointed us , is god ;
not for that we have dominion over your faith , but are helpers of your joy : for by faith ye stand .
moreover i call god for a record upon my soul , that to spare you i came not as yet unto corinth .
for all the promises of god in him are yea , and in him amen , unto the glory of god by us .
and it came to pass on the eighth day , that moses called aaron and his sons , and the elders of israel ;
and the sons of nadab ; seled , and appaim : but seled died without children .
and the number of them that lapped , putting their hand to their mouth , were three hundred men : but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water .
and the lord said unto gideon , by the three hundred men that lapped will i save you , and deliver the midianites into thine hand : and let all the other people go every man unto his place .
and the sons of jada the brother of shammai ; jether and jonathan : and jether died without children .
and the sons of appaim ; ishi . and the sons of ishi ; sheshan . and the children of sheshan ; ahlai .
so he brought down the people unto the water : and the lord said unto gideon , every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue , as a dog lappeth , him shalt thou set by himself ; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink .
for as the earth bringeth forth her bud , and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth ; so the lord god will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations .
so the people took victuals in their hand , and their trumpets : and he sent all the rest of israel every man unto his tent , and retained those three hundred men : and the host of midian was beneath him in the valley .
and it came to pass the same night , that the lord said unto him , arise , get thee down unto the host ; for i have delivered it into thine hand .
jerahmeel had also another wife , whose name was atarah ; she was the mother of onam .
and the sons of ram the firstborn of jerahmeel were , maaz , and jamin , and eker .
and the sons of onam were , shammai , and jada . and the sons of shammai ; nadab , and abishur .
i will greatly rejoice in the lord , my soul shall be joyful in my god ; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation , he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness , as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments , and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels .
and the name of the wife of abishur was abihail , and she bare him ahban , and molid .
and segub begat jair , who had three and twenty cities in the land of gilead .
now therefore go to , proclaim in the ears of the people , saying , whosoever is fearful and afraid , let him return and depart early from mount gilead . and there returned of the people twenty and two thousand ; and there remained ten thousand .
and he took geshur , and aram , with the towns of jair , from them , with kenath , and the towns thereof , even threescore cities . all these belonged to the sons of machir the father of gilead .
and the lord said unto gideon , the people that are with thee are too many for me to give the midianites into their hands , lest israel vaunt themselves against me , saying , mine own hand hath saved me .
and after that hezron was dead in caleb - ephratah , then abiah hezron ' s wife bare him ashur the father of tekoa .
then jerubbaal , who is gideon , and all the people that were with him , rose up early , and pitched beside the well of harod : so that the host of the midianites were on the north side of them , by the hill of moreh , in the valley .
and the sons of jerahmeel the firstborn of hezron were , ram the firstborn , and bunah , and oren , and ozem , and ahijah .
and afterward hezron went in to the daughter of machir the father of gilead , whom he married when he was threescore years old ; and she bare him segub .
and abigail bare amasa : and the father of amasa was jether the ishmeelite .
and caleb the son of hezron begat children of azubah his wife , and of jerioth : her sons are these ; jesher , and shobab , and ardon .
ozem the sixth , david the seventh :
whose sisters were zeruiah , and abigail . and the sons of zeruiah ; abishai , and joab , and asahel , three .
and jesse begat his firstborn eliab , and abinadab the second , and shimma the third ,
nethaneel the fourth , raddai the fifth ,
and nahshon begat salma , and salma begat boaz ,
and boaz begat obed , and obed begat jesse ,
and when azubah was dead , caleb took unto him ephrath , which bare him hur .
these were the sons of caleb the son of hur , the firstborn of ephratah ; shobal the father of kirjath - jearim ,
and shobal the father of kirjath - jearim had sons ; haroeh , and half of the manahethites .
salma the father of bethlehem , hareph the father of beth - gader .
the sons of salma ; bethlehem , and the netophathites , ataroth , the house of joab , and half of the manahethites , the zorites .
and the families of kirjath - jearim ; the ithrites , and the puhites , and the shumathites , and the mishraites ; of them came the zareathites , and the eshtaulites .
and shema begat raham , the father of jorkoam : and rekem begat shammai .
and the son of shammai was maon : and maon was the father of beth - zur .
and ephah , caleb ' s concubine , bare haran , and moza , and gazez : and haran begat gazez .
and the sons of jahdai ; regem , and jotham , and geshan , and pelet , and ephah , and shaaph .
maachah , caleb ' s concubine , bare sheber , and tirhanah .
she bare also shaaph the father of madmannah , sheva the father of machbenah , and the father of gibea : and the daughter of caleb was achsah .
thou rulest the raging of the sea : when the waves thereof arise , thou stillest them .
god is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints , and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him .
for who in the heaven can be compared unto the lord ? who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the lord ?
and the heavens shall praise thy wonders , o lord : thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints .
and the sons of hebron ; korah , and tappuah , and rekem , and shema .
thy seed will i establish for ever , and build up thy throne to all generations . selah .
now the sons of caleb the brother of jerahmeel were , mesha his firstborn , which was the father of ziph ; and the sons of mareshah the father of hebron .
i have made a covenant with my chosen , i have sworn unto david my servant ,
and shallum begat jekamiah , and jekamiah begat elishama .
for i have said , mercy shall be built up for ever : thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens .
and eleasah begat sisamai , and sisamai begat shallum ,
i will sing of the mercies of the lord for ever : with my mouth will i make known thy faithfulness to all generations .
and sheshan gave his daughter to jarha his servant to wife ; and she bare him attai .
saying , unto thee will i give the land of canaan , the lot of your inheritance :
and attai begat nathan , and nathan begat zabad ,
when they were but a few men in number ; yea , very few , and strangers in it .
and the sons of jonathan ; peleth , and zaza . these were the sons of jerahmeel .
when they went from one nation to another , from one kingdom to another people ;
now sheshan had no sons , but daughters . and sheshan had a servant , an egyptian , whose name was jarha .
he suffered no man to do them wrong : yea , he reproved kings for their sakes ;
and azariah begat helez , and helez begat eleasah ,
and zabad begat ephlal , and ephlal begat obed ,
and obed begat jehu , and jehu begat azariah ,
and confirmed the same unto jacob for a law , and to israel for an everlasting covenant :
and they brought that which moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation : and all the congregation drew near and stood before the lord .
until the time that his word came : the word of the lord tried him .
also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings , to sacrifice before the lord ; and a meat offering mingled with oil : for to day the lord will appear unto you .
and unto the children of israel thou shalt speak , saying , take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering ; and a calf and a lamb , both of the first year , without blemish , for a burnt offering ;
and he said unto aaron , take thee a young calf for a sin offering , and a ram for a burnt offering , without blemish , and offer them before the lord .
and the sons of aaron brought the blood unto him : and he dipped his finger in the blood , and put it upon the horns of the altar , and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar :
saying , touch not mine anointed , and do my prophets no harm .
aaron therefore went unto the altar , and slew the calf of the sin offering , which was for himself .
moreover he called for a famine upon the land : he brake the whole staff of bread .
and moses said unto aaron , go unto the altar , and offer thy sin offering , and thy burnt offering , and make an atonement for thyself , and for the people : and offer the offering of the people , and make an atonement for them ; as the lord commanded .
he sent a man before them , even joseph , who was sold for a servant :
and moses said , this is the thing which the lord commanded that ye should do : and the glory of the lord shall appear unto you .
whose feet they hurt with fetters : he was laid in iron :
ask , and it shall be given you ; seek , and ye shall find ; knock , and it shall be opened unto you :
when he shall come to be glorified in his saints , and to be admired in all them that believe ( because our testimony among you was believed ) in that day .
for every one that asketh receiveth ; and he that seeketh findeth ; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened .
thou hypocrite , first cast out the beam out of thine own eye ; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother ' s eye .
that the name of our lord jesus christ may be glorified in you , and ye in him , according to the grace of our god and the lord jesus christ .
give not that which is holy unto the dogs , neither cast ye your pearls before swine , lest they trample them under their feet , and turn again and rend you .
and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother ' s eye , but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye ?
or how wilt thou say to thy brother , let me pull out the mote out of thine eye ; and , behold , a beam is in thine own eye ?
judge not , that ye be not judged .
for with what judgment ye judge , ye shall be judged : and with what measure ye mete , it shall be measured to you again .
or what man is there of you , whom if his son ask bread , will he give him a stone ?
he turned their waters into blood , and slew their fish .
he sent darkness , and made it dark ; and they rebelled not against his word .
yea , behold , being planted , shall it prosper ? shall it not utterly wither , when the east wind toucheth it ? it shall wither in the furrows where it grew .
furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us , and we gave them reverence : shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits , and live ?
they shewed his signs among them , and wonders in the land of ham .
moreover the word of the lord came unto me , saying ,
but if ye be without chastisement , whereof all are partakers , then are ye bastards , and not sons .
he sent moses his servant ; and aaron whom he had chosen .
say now to the rebellious house , know ye not what these things mean ? tell them , behold , the king of babylon is come to jerusalem , and hath taken the king thereof , and the princes thereof , and led them with him to babylon ;
or speak to the earth , and it shall teach thee : and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee .
who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the lord hath wrought this ?
i am as one mocked of his neighbour , who calleth upon god , and he answereth him : the just upright man is laughed to scorn .
he made him lord of his house , and ruler of all his substance :
he that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease .
the king sent and loosed him ; even the ruler of the people , and let him go free .
the tabernacles of robbers prosper , and they that provoke god are secure ; into whose hand god bringeth abundantly .
but ask now the beasts , and they shall teach thee ; and the fowls of the air , and they shall tell thee :
he turned their heart to hate his people , to deal subtilly with his servants .
and job answered and said ,
and he increased his people greatly ; and made them stronger than their enemies .
no doubt but ye are the people , and wisdom shall die with you .
israel also came into egypt ; and jacob sojourned in the land of ham .
but i have understanding as well as you ; i am not inferior to you : yea , who knoweth not such things as these ?
to bind his princes at his pleasure ; and teach his senators wisdom .
wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses , let us lay aside every weight , and the sin which doth so easily beset us , and let us run with patience the race that is set before us ,
therefore thus saith the lord god ; as i live , surely mine oath that he hath despised , and my covenant that he hath broken , even it will i recompense upon his own head .
looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith ; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross , despising the shame , and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god .
seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant , when , lo , he had given his hand , and hath done all these things , he shall not escape .
for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself , lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds .
neither shall pharaoh with his mighty army and great company make for him in the war , by casting up mounts , and building forts , to cut off many persons :
ye have not yet resisted unto blood , striving against sin .
as i live , saith the lord god , surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king , whose oath he despised , and whose covenant he brake , even with him in the midst of babylon he shall die .
and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children , my son , despise not thou the chastening of the lord , nor faint when thou art rebuked of him :
for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth , and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth .
that the kingdom might be base , that it might not lift itself up , but that by keeping of his covenant it might stand .
if ye endure chastening , god dealeth with you as with sons ; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not ?
and hath taken of the king ' s seed , and made a covenant with him , and hath taken an oath of him : he hath also taken the mighty of the land :
egypt was glad when they departed : for the fear of them fell upon them .
thus saith the lord god ; i will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar , and will set it ; i will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender one , and will plant it upon an high mountain and eminent :
he brought them forth also with silver and gold : and there was not one feeble person among their tribes .
in the mountain of the height of israel will i plant it : and it shall bring forth boughs , and bear fruit , and be a goodly cedar : and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing ; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell .
and i will spread my net upon him , and he shall be taken in my snare , and i will bring him to babylon , and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me .
he spread a cloud for a covering ; and fire to give light in the night .
and all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword , and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds : and ye shall know that i the lord have spoken it .
their land brought forth frogs in abundance , in the chambers of their kings .
he gave them hail for rain , and flaming fire in their land .
he spake , and there came divers sorts of flies , and lice in all their coasts .
he spake , and the locusts came , and caterpillers , and that without number ,
he smote their vines also and their fig trees ; and brake the trees of their coasts .
he smote also all the firstborn in their land , the chief of all their strength .
and the families of the scribes which dwelt at jabez ; the tirathites , the shimeathites , and suchathites . these are the kenites that came of hemath , the father of the house of rechab .
and did eat up all the herbs in their land , and devoured the fruit of their ground .
that they might observe his statutes , and keep his laws . praise ye the lord .
and gave them the lands of the heathen : and they inherited the labour of the people ;
for he remembered his holy promise , and abraham his servant .
he opened the rock , and the waters gushed out ; they ran in the dry places like a river .
the people asked , and he brought quails , and satisfied them with the bread of heaven .
and the king said , thou shalt surely die , ahimelech , thou , and all thy father ' s house .
and nob , the city of the priests , smote he with the edge of the sword , both men and women , children and sucklings , and oxen , and asses , and sheep , with the edge of the sword .
and saul said , hear now , thou son of ahitub . and he answered , here i am , my lord .
and saul said unto him , why have ye conspired against me , thou and the son of jesse , in that thou hast given him bread , and a sword , and hast inquired of god for him , that he should rise against me , to lie in wait , as at this day ?
then ahimelech answered the king , and said , and who is so faithful among all thy servants as david , which is the king ' s son in law , and goeth at thy bidding , and is honourable in thine house ?
did i then begin to inquire of god for him ? be it far from me : let not the king impute any thing un to his servant , nor to all the house of my father : for thy servant knew nothing of all this , less or more .
and he inquired of the lord for him , and gave him victuals , and gave him the sword of goliath the philistine .
then the king sent to call ahimelech the priest , the son of ahitub , and all his father ' s house , the priests that were in nob : and they came all of them to the king .
they shall go down to the bars of the pit , when our rest together is in the dust .
i have said to corruption , thou art my father : to the worm , thou are my mother , and my sister .
and where is now my hope ? as for my hope , who shall see it ?
they change the night into day : the light is short because of darkness .
if i wait , the grave is mine house : i have made my bed in the darkness .
but as for you all , do ye return , and come now : for i cannot find one wise man among you .
my days are past , my purposes are broken off , even the thoughts of my heart .
abide thou with me , fear not : for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life : but with me thou shalt be in safeguard .
and abiathar shewed david that saul had slain the lord ' s priests .
and david said unto abiathar , i knew it that day , when doeg the edomite was there , that he would surely tell saul : i have occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father ' s house .
and one of the sons of ahimelech the son of ahitub , named abiathar , escaped , and fled after david .
hear my prayer , o lord , and let my cry come unto thee .
hide not thy face from me in the day when i am in trouble ; incline thine ear unto me : in the day when i call answer me speedily .
by reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin .
i am like a pelican of the wilderness : i am like an owl of the desert .
for my days are consumed like smoke , and my bones are burned as an hearth .
my heart is smitten , and withered like grass ; so that i forget to eat my bread .
and i turned to see the voice that spake with me . and being turned , i saw seven golden candlesticks ;
therefore thus saith the lord god ; because ye are all become dross , behold , therefore i will gather you into the midst of jerusalem .
and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man , clothed with a garment down to the foot , and girt about the paps with a golden girdle .
and the word of the lord came unto me , saying ,
son of man , the house of israel is to me become dross : all they are brass , and tin , and iron , and lead , in the midst of the furnace ; they are even the dross of silver .
i was in the spirit on the lord ' s day , and heard behind me a great voice , as of a trumpet ,
and i will scatter thee among the heathen , and disperse thee in the countries , and will consume thy filthiness out of thee .
and thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen , and thou shalt know that i am the lord .
behold , therefore i have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made , and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee .
write the things which thou hast seen , and the things which are , and the things which shall be hereafter ;
can thine heart endure , or can thine hands be strong , in the days that i shall deal with thee ? i the lord have spoken it , and will do it .
in thee have they taken gifts to shed blood ; thou hast taken usury and increase , and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion , and hast forgotten me , saith the lord god .
and he had in his right hand seven stars : and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword : and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength .
and his feet like unto fine brass , as if they burned in a furnace ; and his voice as the sound of many waters .
in thee have they discovered their fathers ' nakedness : in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution .
i am he that liveth , and was dead ; and , behold , i am alive for evermore , amen ; and have the keys of hell and of death .
and when i saw him , i fell at his feet as dead . and he laid his right hand upon me , saying unto me , fear not ; i am the first and the last :
mine enemies reproach me all the day ; and they that are mad against me are sworn against me .
for i have eaten ashes like bread , and mingled my drink with weeping ,
her priests have violated my law , and have profaned mine holy things : they have put no difference between the holy and profane , neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean , and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths , and i am profaned among them .
her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey , to shed blood , and to destroy souls , to get dishonest gain .
and her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter , seeing vanity , and divining lies unto them , saying , thus saith the lord god , when the lord hath not spoken .
the people of the land have used oppression , and exercised robbery , and have vexed the poor and needy : yea , they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully .
as silver is melted in the midst of the furnace , so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof ; and ye shall know that i the lord have poured out my fury upon you .
and the word of the lord came unto me , saying ,
and david commanded his young men , and they slew them , and cut off their hands and their feet , and hanged them up over the pool in hebron . but they took the head of ish - bosheth , and buried it in the sepulchre of abner in hebron .
son of man , say unto her , thou art the land that is not cleansed , nor rained upon in the day of indignation .
how much more , when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed ? shall i not therefore now require his blood of your hand , and take you away from the earth ?
there is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof , like a roaring lion ravening the prey ; they have devoured souls ; they have taken the treasure and precious things ; they have made her many widows in the midst thereof .
as they gather silver , and brass , and iron , and lead , and tin , into the midst of the furnace , to blow the fire upon it , to melt it ; so will i gather you in mine anger and in my fury , and i will leave you there , and melt you .
yea , i will gather you , and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath , and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof .
and the ziphites came unto saul to gibeah , saying , doth not david hide himself in the hill of hachilah , which is before jeshimon ?
then saul arose , and went down to the wilderness of ziph , having three thousand chosen men of israel with him , to seek david in the wilderness of ziph .
and saul pitched in the hill of hachilah , which is before jeshimon , by the way . but david abode in the wilderness , and he saw that saul came after him into the wilderness .
david therefore sent out spies , and understood that saul was come in very deed .
and david arose , and came to the place where saul had pitched : and david beheld the place where saul lay , and abner the son of ner , the captain of his host : and saul lay in the trench , and the people pitched round about him .
then answered david and said to ahimelech the hittite , and to abishai the son of zeruiah , brother to joab , saying , who will go down with me to saul to the camp ? and abishai said , i will go down with thee .
so david and abishai came to the people by night : and , behold , saul lay sleeping within the trench , and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster : but abner and the people lay round about him .
then said abishai to david , god hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day : now therefore let me smite him , i pray thee , with the spear even to the earth at once , and i will not smite him the second time .
and david said to abishai , destroy him not : for who can stretch forth his hand against the lord ' s anointed , and be guiltless ?
and hagar bare abram a son : and abram called his son ' s name , which hagar bare , ishmael .
wherefore the well was called beer - lahai - roi ; behold , it is between kadesh and bered .
and she called the name of the lord that spake unto her , thou god seest me : for she said , have i also here looked after him that seeth me ?
and he will be a wild man ; his hand will be against every man , and every man ' s hand against him ; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren .
moreover uzziah built towers in jerusalem at the corner gate , and at the valley gate , and at the turning of the wall , and fortified them .
and i will strengthen them in the lord ; and they shall walk up and down in his name , saith the lord .
and god helped him against the philistines , and against the arabians that dwelt in gur - baal , and the mehunims .
i will bring them again also out of the land of egypt , and gather them out of assyria ; and i will bring them into the land of gilead and labanon ; and place shall not be found for them .
and the ammonites gave gifts to uzziah : and his name spread abroad even to the entering in of egypt ; for he strengthened himself exceedingly .
and the angel of the lord said unto her , i will multiply thy seed exceedingly , that it shall not be numbered for multitude .
and the angel of the lord said unto her , behold , thou art with child , and shalt bear a son , and shalt call his name ishmael ; because the lord hath heard thy affliction .
he built eloth , and restored it to judah , after that the king slept with his fathers .
then all the people of judah took uzziah , who was sixteen years old , and made him king in the room of his father amaziah .
and he went forth and warred against the philistines , and brake down the wall of gath , and the wall of jabneh , and the wall of ashdod , and built cities about ashdod , and among the philistines .
and he sought god in the days of zechariah , who had understanding in the visions of god : and as long as he sought the lord , god made him to prosper .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord , according to all that his father amaziah did .
sixteen years old was uzziah when he began to reign , and he reigned fifty and two years in jerusalem . his mother ' s name also was jecoliah of jerusalem .
he discovereth deep things out of darkness , and bringeth out to light the shadow of death .
he increaseth the nations , and destroyeth them : he enlargeth the nations , and straiteneth them again .
he taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth , and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way .
they grope in the dark without light , and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man .
he poureth contempt upon princes , and weakeneth the strength of the mighty .
he removeth away the speech of the trusty , and taketh away the understanding of the aged .
and elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets , and said unto him , gird up thy loins , and take this box of oil in thine hand , and go to ramoth - gilead :
and the lord god said unto the serpent , because thou hast done this , thou art cursed above all cattle , and above every beast of the field ; upon thy belly shalt thou go , and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life :
through thee will we push down our enemies : through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us .
and when thou comest thither , look out there jehu the son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi , and go in , and make him arise up from among his brethren , and carry him to an inner chamber ;
and i will put enmity between thee and the woman , and between thy seed and her seed ; it shall bruise thy head , and thou shalt bruise his heel .
thou art my king , o god : command deliverances for jacob .
unto the woman he said , i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception ; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children ; and thy desire shall be to thy husband , and he shall rule over thee .
the lord is my rock , and my fortress , and my deliverer ; my god , my strength , in whom i will trust ; my buckler , and the horn of my salvation , and my high tower .
for they got not the land in possession by their own sword , neither did their own arm save them : but thy right hand , and thine arm , and the light of thy countenance , because thou hadst a favour unto them .
i will love thee , o lord , my strength .
how thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand , and plantedst them ; how thou didst afflict the people , and cast them out .
and when he came , behold , the captains of the host were sitting ; and he said , i have an errand to thee , o captain . and jehu said , unto which of all us ? and he said , to thee , o captain .
thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee ; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field ;
but thou hast cast off , and put us to shame ; and goest not forth with our armies .
and he arose , and went into the house ; and he poured the oil on his head , and said unto him , thus saith the lord god of israel , i have anointed thee king over the people of the lord , even over israel .
in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread , till thou return unto the ground ; for out of it wast thou taken : for dust thou art , and unto dust shalt thou return .
in god we boast all the day long , and praise thy name for ever . selah .
then take the box of oil , and pour it on his head , and say , thus saith the lord , i have anointed thee king over israel . then open the door , and flee , and tarry not .
but thou hast saved us from our enemies , and hast put them to shame that hated us .
so the young man , even the young man the prophet , went to ramoth - gilead .
for i will not trust in my bow , neither shall my sword save me .
and i will make the house of ahab like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat , and like the house of baasha the son of ahijah :
there went up a smoke out of his nostrils , and fire out of his mouth devoured : coals were kindled by it .
then the earth shook and trembled ; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken , because he was wroth .
and thou shalt smite the house of ahab thy master , that i may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets , and the blood of all the servants of the lord , at the hand of jezebel .
for the whole house of ahab shall perish : and i will cut off from ahab him that pisseth against the wall , and him that is shut up and left in israel :
he bowed the heavens also , and came down : and darkness was under his feet .
and he said , i heard thy voice in the garden , and i was afraid , because i was naked ; and i hid myself .
the sorrows of death compassed me , and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid .
and he said , who told thee that thou wast naked ? hast thou eaten of the tree , whereof i commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat ?
i will call upon the lord , who is worthy to be praised : so shall i be saved from mine enemies .
and the man said , the woman whom thou gavest to be with me , she gave me of the tree , and i did eat .
in my distress i called upon the lord , and cried unto my god : he heard my voice out of his temple , and my cry came before him , even into his ears .
and the lord god said unto the woman , what is this that thou hast done ? and the woman said , the serpent beguiled me , and i did eat .
in whose hand is the soul of every living thing , and the breath of all mankind .
the sorrows of hell compassed me about : the snares of death prevented me .
with the ancient is wisdom ; and in length of days understanding .
doth not the ear try words ? and the mouth taste his meat ?
behold , he breaketh down , and it cannot be built again : he shutteth up a man , and there can be no opening .
with him is wisdom and strength , he hath counsel and understanding .
behold , he withholdeth the waters , and they dry up : also he sendeth them out , and they overturn the earth .
he looseth the bond of kings , and girdeth their loins with a girdle .
he leadeth counsellers away spoiled , and maketh the judges fools .
he leadeth princes away spoiled , and overthroweth the mighty .
for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them , and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters : and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes .
and adam called his wife ' s name eve ; because she was the mother of all living .
and i said unto him , sir , thou knowest . and he said to me , these are they which came out of great tribulation , and have washed their robes , and made them white in the blood of the lamb .
therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden , to till the ground from whence he was taken .
and one of the elders answered , saying unto me , what are these which are arrayed in white robes ? and whence came they ?
so he drove out the man ; and he placed at the east of the garden of eden cherubims , and a flaming sword which turned every way , to keep the way of the tree of life .
they shall hunger no more , neither thirst any more ; neither shall the sun light on them , nor any heat .
unto adam also and to his wife did the lord god make coats of skins , and clothed them .
therefore are they before the throne of god , and serve him day and night in his temple : and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them .
and the lord god said , behold , the man is become as one of us , to know good and evil : and now , lest he put forth his hand , and take also of the tree of life , and eat , and live for ever :
and cried with a loud voice , saying , salvation to our god which sitteth upon the throne , and unto the lamb .
and all the angels stood round about the throne , and about the elders and the four beasts , and fell before the throne on their faces , and worshipped god ,
saying , amen : blessing , and glory , and wisdom , and thanksgiving , and honour , and power , and might , be unto our god for ever and ever . amen .
we have heard with our ears , o god , our fathers have told us , what work thou didst in their days , in the times of old .
hear this word that the lord hath spoken against you , o children of israel , against the whole family which i brought up from the land of egypt , saying ,
and they warred against the midianites , as the lord commanded moses ; and they slew all the males .
and moses sent them to the war , a thousand of every tribe , them and phinehas the son of eleazar the priest , to the war , with the holy instruments , and the trumpets to blow in his hand .
so there were delivered out of the thousands of israel , a thousand of every tribe , twelve thousand armed for war .
of every tribe a thousand , throughout all the tribes of israel , shall ye send to the war .
and the children of israel took all the women of midian captives , and their little ones , and took the spoil of all their cattle , and all their flocks , and all their goods .
and moses spake unto the people , saying , arm some of yourselves unto the war , and let them go against the midianites , and avenge the lord of midian .
avenge the children of israel of the midianites : afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
and jeremiah said to seraiah , when thou comest to babylon , and shalt see , and shalt read all these words ;
then shalt thou say , o lord , thou hast spoken against this place , to cut it off , that none shall remain in it , neither man nor beast , but that it shall be desolate for ever .
so jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon babylon , even all these words that are written against babylon .
and it shall be , when thou hast made an end of reading this book , that thou shalt bind a stone to it , and cast it into the midst of euphrates :
and thou shalt say , thus shall babylon sink , and shall not rise from the evil that i will bring upon her : and they shall be weary . thus far are the words of jeremiah .
will a lion roar in the forest , when he hath no prey ? will a young lion cry out of his den , if he have taken nothing ?
can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth , where no gin is for him ? shall one take up a snare from the earth , and have taken nothing at all ?
you only have i known of all the families of the earth : therefore i will punish you for all your iniquities .
can two walk together , except they be agreed ?
the lion hath roared , who will not fear ? the lord god hath spoken , who can but prophesy ?
publish in the palaces at ashdod , and in the palaces in the land of egypt , and say , assemble yourselves upon the mountains of samaria , and behold the great tumults in the midst thereof , and the oppressed in the midst thereof .
shall a trumpet be blown in the city , and the people not be afraid ? shall there be evil in a city , and the lord hath not done it ?
surely the lord god will do nothing , but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets .
surely every man walketh in a vain shew : surely they are disquieted in vain : he heapeth up riches , and knoweth not who shall gather them .
but i will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee ; which have said to thy soul , bow down , that we may go over : and thou hast laid thy body as the ground , and as the street , to them that went over .
though babylon should mount up to heaven , and though she should fortify the height of her strength , yet from me shall spoilers come unto her , saith the lord .
and i sought for a man among them , that should make up the hedge , and stand in the gap before me for the land , that i should not destroy it : but i found none .
and now , lord , what wait i for ? my hope is in thee .
wherefore , behold , the days come , saith the lord , that i will do judgment upon her graven images : and through all her land the wounded shall groan .
lord , make me to know mine end , and the measure of my days , what it is ; that i may know how frail i am .
because the lord hath spoiled babylon , and destroyed out of her the great voice ; when her waves do roar like great waters , a noise of their voice is uttered :
behold , thou hast made my days as an handbreadth ; and mine age is as nothing before thee : verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity . selah .
a sound of a cry cometh from babylon , and great destruction from the land of the chaldeans :
therefore have i poured out mine indignation upon them ; i have consumed them with the fire of my wrath : their own way have i recompensed upon their heads , saith the lord god .
a seed shall serve him ; it shall be accounted to the lord for a generation .
deliver me from all my transgressions : make me not the reproach of the foolish .
we are confounded , because we have heard reproach : shame hath covered our faces : for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the lord ' s house .
standing afar off for the fear of her torment , saying , alas , alas , that great city babylon , that mighty city ! for in one hour is thy judgment come .
i was dumb , i opened not my mouth ; because thou didst it .
ye that have escaped the sword , go away , stand not still : remember the lord afar off , and let jerusalem come into your mind .
but the multitude of the city was divided : and part held with the jews , and part with the apostles .
long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the lord , which gave testimony unto the word of his grace , and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands .
they were ware of it , and fled unto lystra and derbe , cities of lycaonia , and unto the region that lieth round about :
and when there was an assault made both of the gentiles , and also of the jews with their rulers , to use them despitefully , and to stone them ,
and there sat a certain man at lystra , impotent in his feet , being a cripple from his mother ' s womb , who never had walked :
i was dumb with silence , i held my peace , even from good ; and my sorrow was stirred .
and there they preached the gospel .
my heart was hot within me , while i was musing the fire burned : then spake i with my tongue ,
the same heard paul speak : who stedfastly beholding him , and perceiving that he had faith to be healed ,
i said , i will take heed to my ways , that i sin not with my tongue : i will keep my mouth with a bridle , while the wicked is before me .
be silent , o all flesh , before the lord : for he is raised up out of his holy habitation .
and they cast dust on their heads , and cried , weeping and wailing , saying , alas , alas , that great city , wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness ! for in one hour is she made desolate .
and it came to pass in iconium , that they went both together into the synagogue of the jews , and so spake , that a great multitude both of the jews and also of the greeks believed .
but the unbelieving jews stirred up the gentiles , and made their minds evil affected against the brethren .
the merchandise of gold , and silver , and precious stones , and of pearls , and fine linen , and purple , and silk , and scarlet , and all thyine wood , and all manner vessels of ivory , and all manner vessels of most precious wood , and of brass , and iron , and marble ,
and the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her ; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more :
and the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee , and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee , and thou shalt find them no more at all .
and cinnamon , and odours , and ointments , and frankincense , and wine , and oil , and fine flour , and wheat , and beasts , and sheep , and horses , and chariots , and slaves , and souls of men .
they shall come , and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born , that he hath done this .
and saying , alas , alas , that great city , that was clothed in fine linen , and purple , and scarlet , and decked with gold , and precious stones , and pearls !
thy sons have fainted , they lie at the head of all the streets , as a wild bull in a net : they are full of the fury of the lord , the rebuke of thy god .
because the spoiler is come upon her , even upon babylon , and her mighty men are taken , every one of their bows is broken : for the lord god of recompences shall surely requite .
the merchants of these things , which were made rich by her , shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment , weeping and wailing ,
and i will make drunk her princes , and her wise men , her captains , and her rulers , and her mighty men : and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep , and not wake , saith the king , whose name is the lord of hosts .
and cried when they saw the smoke of her burning , saying , what city is like unto this great city !
thus saith thy lord the lord , and thy god that pleadeth the cause of his people , behold , i have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling , even the dregs of the cup of my fury ; thou shalt no more drink it again :
thus saith the lord of hosts ; the broad walls of babylon shall be utterly broken , and her high gates shall be burned with fire ; and the people shall labour in vain , and the folk in the fire , and they shall be weary .
for in one hour so great riches is come to nought . and every shipmaster , and all the company in ships , and sailors , and as many as trade by sea , stood afar off ,
therefore hear now this , thou afflicted , and drunken , but not with wine :
the word which jeremiah the prophet commanded seraiah the son of neriah , the son of maaseiah , when he went with zedekiah the king of judah into babylon in the fourth year of his reign . and this seraiah was a quiet prince .
and i will punish bel in babylon , and i will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up : and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him : yea , the wall of babylon shall fall .
but i am the lord thy god , that divided the sea , whose waves roared : the lord of hosts is his name .
her cities are a desolation , a dry land , and a wilderness , a land wherein no man dwelleth , neither doth any son of man pass thereby .
i , even i , am he that comforteth you : who art thou , that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die , and of the son of man which shall be made as grass ;
the sea is come up upon babylon : she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof .
and forgettest the lord thy maker , that hath stretched forth the heavens , and laid the foundations of the earth ; and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor , as if he were ready to destroy ? and where is the fury of the oppressor ?
how is sheshach taken ! and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised ! how is babylon become an astonishment among the nations !
rejoice over her , thou heaven , and ye holy apostles and prophets ; for god hath avenged you on her .
there is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth ; neither is there any that taketh her by the hand of all the sons that she hath brought up .
i will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter , like rams with he goats .
and a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone , and cast it into the sea , saying , thus with violence shall that great city babylon be thrown down , and shall be found no more at all .
these two things are come unto thee ; who shall be sorry for thee ? desolation , and destruction , and the famine , and the sword : by whom shall i comfort thee ?
and i have put my words in thy mouth , and i have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand , that i may plant the heavens , and lay the foundations of the earth , and say unto zion , thou art my people .
awake , awake , stand up , o jerusalem , which hast drunk at the hand of the lord the cup of his fury ; thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling , and wrung them out .
all they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship : all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him : and none can keep alive his own soul .
for the kingdom is the lord ' s : and he is the governor among the nations .
sing and rejoice , o daughter of zion : for , lo , i come , and i will dwell in the midst of thee , saith the lord .
and many nations shall be joined to the lord in that day , and shall be my people : and i will dwell in the midst of thee , and thou shalt know that the lord of hosts hath sent me unto thee .
save me from the lion ' s mouth : for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns .
and in her was found the blood of prophets , and of saints , and of all that were slain upon the earth .
and the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee ; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee : for thy merchants were the great men of the earth ; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived .
ye that fear the lord , praise him ; all ye the seed of jacob , glorify him ; and fear him , all ye the seed of israel .
as babylon hath caused the slain of israel to fall , so at babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth .
and the voice of harpers , and musicians , and of pipers , and trumpeters , shall be heard no more at all in thee ; and no craftsman , of whatsoever craft he be , shall be found any more in thee ; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee ;
i will declare thy name unto my brethren : in the midst of the congregation will i praise thee .
my praise shall be of thee in the great congregation : i will pay my vows before them that fear him .
therefore the redeemed of the lord shall return , and come with singing unto zion ; and everlasting joy shall be upon their head : they shall obtain gladness and joy ; and sorrow and mourning shall flee away .
therefore , behold , the days come , that i will do judgment upon the graven images of babylon : and her whole land shall be confounded , and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her .
for he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted ; neither hath he hid his face from him ; but when he cried unto him , he heard .
art thou not it which hath dried the sea , the waters of the great deep ; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over ?
then the heaven and the earth , and all that is therein , shall sing for babylon : for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north , saith the lord .
all the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the lord : and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee .
my people , go ye out of the midst of her , and deliver ye every man his soul from the fierce anger of the lord .
the meek shall eat and be satisfied : they shall praise the lord that seek him : your heart shall live for ever .
and lest your heart faint , and ye fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land ; a rumour shall both come one year , and after that in another year shall come a rumour , and violence in the land , ruler against ruler .
one post shall run to meet another , and one messenger to meet another , to shew the king of babylon that his city is taken at one end ,
the mighty men of babylon have forborn to fight , they have remained in their holds : their might hath failed ; they became as women : they have burned her dwellingplaces ; her bars are broken .
for thus saith the lord of hosts , the god of israel ; the daughter of babylon is like a threshingfloor , it is time to thresh her : yet a little while , and the time of her harvest shall come .
and that the passages are stopped , and the reeds they have burned with fire , and the men of war are affrighted .
but be not thou far from me , o lord : o my strength , haste thee to help me .
they part my garments among them , and cast lots upon my vesture .
i may tell all my bones : they look and stare upon me .
for dogs have compassed me : the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me : they pierced my hands and my feet .
nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon hath devoured me , he hath crushed me , he hath made me an empty vessel , he hath swallowed me up like a dragon , he hath filled his belly with my delicates , he hath cast me out .
my strength is dried up like a potsherd ; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws ; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death .
the violence done to me and to my flesh be upon babylon , shall the inhabitant of zion say ; and my blood upon the inhabitants of chaldea , shall jerusalem say .
i am poured out like water , and all my bones are out of joint : my heart is like wax ; it is melted in the midst of my bowels .
therefore thus saith the lord ; behold , i will plead thy cause , and take vengeance for thee ; and i will dry up her sea , and make her springs dry .
they gaped upon me with their mouths , as a ravening and a roaring lion .
and babylon shall become heaps , a dwellingplace for dragons , an astonishment , and an hissing , without an inhabitant .
many bulls have compassed me : strong bulls of bashan have beset me round .
they shall roar together like lions : they shall yell as lion ' s whelps .
be not far from me ; for trouble is near ; for there is none to help .
in their heat i will make their feasts , and i will make them drunken , that they may rejoice , and sleep a perpetual sleep , and not wake , saith the lord .
i was cast upon thee from the womb : thou art my god from my mother ' s belly .
with thee also will i break in pieces man and woman ; and with thee will i break in pieces old and young ; and with thee will i break in pieces the young man and the maid ;
and with thee will i break in pieces the horse and his rider ; and with thee will i break in pieces the chariot and his rider ;
thou art my battle axe and weapons of war : for with thee will i break in pieces the nations , and with thee will i destroy kingdoms ;
behold , i am against thee , o destroying mountain , saith the lord , which destroyest all the earth : and i will stretch out mine hand upon thee , and roll thee down from the rocks , and will make thee a burnt mountain .
and they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner , nor a stone for foundations ; but thou shalt be desolate for ever , saith the lord .
i will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock ; and with thee will i break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen ; and with thee will i break in pieces captains and rulers .
and i will render unto babylon and to all the inhabitants of chaldea all their evil that they have done in zion in your sight , saith the lord .
and the land shall tremble and sorrow : for every purpose of the lord shall be performed against babylon , to make the land of babylon a desolation without an inhabitant .
set ye up a standard in the land , blow the trumpet among the nations , prepare the nations against her , call together against her the kingdoms of ararat , minni , and ashchenaz ; appoint a captain against her ; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillers .
prepare against her the nations with the kings of the medes , the captains thereof , and all the rulers thereof , and all the land of his dominion .
but without faith it is impossible to please him : for he that cometh to god must believe that he is , and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him .
by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death ; and was not found , because god had translated him : for before his translation he had this testimony , that he pleased god .
by faith abraham , when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance , obeyed ; and he went out , not knowing whither he went .
by faith noah , being warned of god of things not seen as yet , moved with fear , prepared an ark to the saving of his house ; by the which he condemned the world , and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith .
for by it the elders obtained a good report .
now faith is the substance of things hoped for , the evidence of things not seen .
by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain , by which he obtained witness that he was righteous , god testifying of his gifts : and by it he being dead yet speaketh .
through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god , so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear .
by faith he sojourned in the land of promise , as in a strange country , dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob , the heirs with him of the same promise :
and they said , the lord commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of israel : and my lord was commanded by the lord to give the inheritance of zelophehad our brother unto his daughters .
and the chief fathers of the families of the children of gilead , the son of machir , the son of manasseh , of the families of the sons of joseph , came near , and spake before moses , and before the princes , the chief fathers of the children of israel :
this is the thing which the lord doth command concerning the daughters of zelophehad , saying , let them marry to whom they think best ; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry .
and moses commanded the children of israel according to the word of the lord , saying , the tribe of the sons of joseph hath said well .
and when the jubile of the children of israel shall be , then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received : so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers .
and if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of israel , then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers , and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received : so shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance .
righteousness shall go before him ; and shall set us in the way of his steps .
yea , the lord shall give that which is good ; and our land shall yield her increase .
truth shall spring out of the earth ; and righteousness shall look down from heaven .
mercy and truth are met together ; righteousness and peace have kissed each other .
and saith unto him , if thou be the son of god , cast thyself down : for it is written , he shall give his angels charge concerning thee : and in their hands they shall bear thee up , lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone .
jesus said unto him , it is written again , thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god .
but he answered and said , it is written , man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god .
then the devil taketh him up into the holy city , and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple ,
again , the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain , and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world , and the glory of them ;
and saith unto him , all these things will i give thee , if thou wilt fall down and worship me .
take aaron and his sons with him , and the garments , and the anointing oil , and a bullock for the sin offering , and two rams , and a basket of unleavened bread ;
then was jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil .
and when the tempter came to him , he said , if thou be the son of god , command that these stones be made bread .
and when he had fasted forty days and forty nights , he was afterward an hungred .
and make ye marriages with us , and give your daughters unto us , and take our daughters unto you .
and the sons of jacob came out of the field when they heard it : and the men were grieved , and they were very wroth , because he had wrought folly in israel in lying with jacob ' s daughter ; which thing ought not to be done .
and hamor communed with them , saying , the soul of my son shechem longeth for your daughter : i pray you give her him to wife .
and jacob heard that he had defiled dinah his daughter : now his sons were with his cattle in the field : and jacob held his peace until they were come .
and hamor the father of shechem went out unto jacob to commune with him .
and his soul clave unto dinah the daughter of jacob , and he loved the damsel , and spake kindly unto the damsel .
and shechem spake unto his father hamor , saying , get me this damsel to wife .
and when shechem the son of hamor the hivite , prince of the country , saw her , he took her , and lay with her , and defiled her .
and dinah the daughter of leah , which she bare unto jacob , went out to see the daughters of the land .
and they smote all the cities round about gerar ; for the fear of the lord came upon them : and they spoiled all the cities ; for there was exceeding much spoil in them .
and asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto gerar : and the ethiopians were overthrown , that they could not recover themselves ; for they were destroyed before the lord , and before his host ; and they carried away very much spoil .
so the lord smote the ethiopians before asa and before judah ; and the ethiopians fled .
they smote also the tents of cattle , and carried away sheep and camels in abundance , and returned to jerusalem .
consider how i love thy precepts : quicken me , o lord , according to thy lovingkindness .
then asa went out against him , and they set the battle in array in the valley of zephathah at mareshah .
i beheld the transgressors , and was grieved ; because they kept not thy word .
great are thy tender mercies , o lord : quicken me according to thy judgments .
salvation is far from the wicked : for they seek not thy statutes .
seven times a day do i praise thee because of thy righteous judgments .
but ye gave the nazarites wine to drink ; and commanded the prophets , saying , prophesy not .
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all . amen .
great peace have they which love thy law : and nothing shall offend them .
behold , i am pressed under you , as a cart is pressed that is full of sheaves .
he which testifieth these things saith , surely i come quickly . amen . even so , come , lord jesus .
i rejoice at thy word , as one that findeth great spoil .
therefore the flight shall perish from the swift , and the strong shall not strengthen his force , neither shall the mighty deliver himself :
i hate and abhor lying : but thy law do i love .
neither shall he stand that handleth the bow ; and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself : neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself .
thy word is true from the beginning : and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever .
princes have persecuted me without a cause : but my heart standeth in awe of thy word .
also i brought you up from the land of egypt , and led you forty years through the wilderness , to possess the land of the amorite .
and i raised up of your sons for prophets , and of your young men for nazarites . is it not even thus , o ye children of israel ? saith the lord .
and moses said unto the children of israel , see , the lord hath called by name bezaleel the son of uri , the son of hur , of the tribe of judah ;
and in the cutting of stones , to set them , and in carving of wood , to make any manner of cunning work .
and he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day , saith the lord .
and he hath put in his heart that he may teach , both he , and aholiab , the son of ahisamach , of the tribe of dan .
except the lord build the house , they labour in vain that build it : except the lord keep the city , the watchman waketh but in vain .
it is vain for you to rise up early , to sit up late , to eat the bread of sorrows : for so he giveth his beloved sleep .
and to devise curious works , to work in gold , and in silver , and in brass ,
lo , children are an heritage of the lord : and the fruit of the womb is his reward .
and all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their hands , and brought that which they had spun , both of blue , and of purple , and of scarlet , and of fine linen .
every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought the lord ' s offering : and every man , with whom was found shittim wood for any work of the service , brought it .
and the rulers brought onyx stones , and stones to be set , for the ephod , and for the breastplate ;
happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them : they shall not be ashamed , but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate .
and all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun goats ' hair .
as arrows are in the hand of a mighty man ; so are children of the youth .
the children of israel brought a willing offering unto the lord , every man and woman , whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work , which the lord had commanded to be made by the hand of moses .
and spice , and oil for the light , and for the anointing oil , and for the sweet incense .
hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness : o lord , quicken me according to thy judgment .
mine eyes prevent the night watches , that i might meditate in thy word .
i cried with my whole heart ; hear me , o lord : i will keep thy statutes .
the righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting : give me understanding , and i shall live .
i cried unto thee ; save me , and i shall keep thy testimonies .
thou art near , o lord ; and all thy commandments are truth .
concerning thy testimonies , i have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever .
he that is unjust , let him be unjust still : and he which is filthy , let him be filthy still : and he that is righteous , let him be righteous still : and he that is holy , let him be holy still .
consider mine affliction , and deliver me : for i do not forget thy law .
and he saith unto me , seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book : for the time is at hand .
plead my cause , and deliver me : quicken me according to thy word .
they draw nigh that follow after mischief : they are far from thy law .
and the spirit and the bride say , come . and let him that heareth say , come . and let him that is athirst come . and whosoever will , let him take the water of life freely .
i jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches . i am the root and the offspring of david , and the bright and morning star .
and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy , god shall take away his part out of the book of life , and out of the holy city , and from the things which are written in this book .
for i testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book , if any man shall add unto these things , god shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book :
i am alpha and omega , the beginning and the end , the first and the last .
and all the congregation of the children of israel departed from the presence of moses .
and , behold , i come quickly ; and my reward is with me , to give every man according as his work shall be .
and they came , every one whose heart stirred him up , and every one whom his spirit made willing , and they brought the lord ' s offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation , and for all his service , and for the holy garments .
for without are dogs , and sorcerers , and whoremongers , and murderers , and idolaters , and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie .
and they came , both men and women , as many as were willing hearted , and brought bracelets , and earrings , and rings , and tablets , all jewels of gold : and every man that offered offered an offering of gold unto the lord .
blessed are they that do his commandments , that they may have right to the tree of life , and may enter in through the gates into the city .
and every man , with whom was found blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine linen , and goats ' hair , and red skins of rams , and badgers ' skins , brought them .
the cloths of service , to do service in the holy place , the holy garments for aaron the priest , and the garments of his sons , to minister in the priest ' s office .
the pins of the tabernacle , and the pins of the court , and their cords ,
the hangings of the court , his pillars , and their sockets , and the hanging for the door of the court ,
the altar of burnt offering , with his brasen grate , his staves , and all his vessels , the laver and his foot ,
their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god : their drink offerings of blood will i not offer , nor take up their names into my lips .
and the incense altar , and his staves , and the anointing oil , and the sweet incense , and the hanging for the door at the entering in of the tabernacle ,
but to the saints that are in the earth , and to the excellent , in whom is all my delight .
the candlestick also for the light , and his furniture , and his lamps , with the oil for the light ,
o my soul , thou hast said unto the lord , thou art my lord : my goodness extendeth not to thee ;
the table , and his staves , and all his vessels , and the shewbread ,
preserve me , o god : for in thee do i put my trust .
i have set the lord always before me : because he is at my right hand , i shall not be moved .
rivers of waters run down mine eyes , because they keep not thy law .
i will bless the lord , who hath given me counsel : my reins also instruct me in the night seasons .
the lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places ; yea , i have a goodly heritage .
deliver me from the oppression of man : so will i keep thy precepts .
the lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup : thou maintainest my lot .
order my steps in thy word : and let not any iniquity have dominion over me .
my zeal hath consumed me , because mine enemies have forgotten thy words .
thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and very faithful .
therefore my heart is glad , and my glory rejoiceth : my flesh also shall rest in hope .
righteous art thou , o lord , and upright are thy judgments .
trouble and anguish have taken hold on me : yet thy commandments are my delights .
thy word is very pure : therefore thy servant loveth it .
i am small and despised : yet do not i forget thy precepts .
and he put the breastplate upon him : also he put in the breastplate the urim and the thummim .
the tabernacle , his tent , and his covering , his taches , and his boards , his bars , his pillars , and his sockets ,
and he put upon him the coat , and girded him with the girdle , and clothed him with the robe , and put the ephod upon him , and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod , and bound it unto him therewith .
the ark , and the staves thereof , with the mercy seat , and the vail of the covering ,
and every wise hearted among you shall come , and make all that the lord hath commanded ;
and moses did as the lord commanded him ; and the assembly was gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
and gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
and moses brought aaron and his sons , and washed them with water .
and moses said unto the congregation , this is the thing which the lord commanded to be done .
mine eyes fail for thy salvation , and for the word of thy righteousness .
be surety for thy servant for good : let not the proud oppress me .
i am thy servant ; give me understanding , that i may know thy testimonies .
deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy , and teach me thy statutes .
therefore i love thy commandments above gold ; yea , above fine gold .
it is time for thee , lord , to work : for they have made void thy law .
thy testimonies are wonderful : therefore doth my soul keep them .
therefore i esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right ; and i hate every false way .
i opened my mouth , and panted : for i longed for thy commandments .
look thou upon me , and be merciful unto me , as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name .
hast thou utterly rejected judah ? hath thy soul lothed zion ? why hast thou smitten us , and there is no healing for us ? we looked for peace , and there is no good ; and for the time of healing , and behold trouble !
if i go forth into the field , then behold the slain with the sword ! and if i enter into the city , then behold them that are sick with famine ! yea , both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not .
therefore thou shalt say this word unto them ; let mine eyes run down with tears night and day , and let them not cease : for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach , with a very grievous blow .
and the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of jerusalem because of the famine and the sword ; and they shall have none to bury them , them , their wives , nor their sons , nor their daughters : for i will pour their wickedness upon them .
therefore thus saith the lord concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name , and i sent them not , yet they say , sword and famine shall not be in this land ; by sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed .
then the lord said unto me , the prophets prophesy lies in my name : i sent them not , neither have i commanded them , neither spake unto them : they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination , and a thing of nought , and the deceit of their heart .
then said i , ah , lord god ! behold , the prophets say unto them , ye shall not see the sword , neither shall ye have famine ; but i will give you assured peace in this place .
when they fast , i will not hear their cry ; and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation , i will not accept them : but i will consume them by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pestilence .
then said the lord unto me , pray not for this people for their good .
thus saith the lord unto this people , thus have they loved to wander , they have not refrained their feet , therefore the lord doth not accept them ; he will now remember their iniquity , and visit their sins .
behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a far country : is not the lord in zion ? is not her king in her ? why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images , and with strange vanities ?
neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe ; but every one of the tribes of the children of israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance .
when i would comfort myself against sorrow , my heart is faint in me .
and every daughter , that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of israel , shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father , that the children of israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers .
so shall not the inheritance of the children of israel remove from tribe to tribe : for every one of the children of israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers .
the harvest is past , the summer is ended , and we are not saved .
are there any among the vanities of the gentiles that can cause rain ? or can the heavens give showers ? art not thou he , o lord our god ? therefore we will wait upon thee : for thou hast made all these things .
for which i am an ambassador in bonds : that therein i may speak boldly , as i ought to speak .
do not abhor us , for thy name ' s sake , do not disgrace the throne of thy glory : remember , break not thy covenant with us .
we acknowledge , o lord , our wickedness , and the iniquity of our fathers : for we have sinned against thee .
whom i have sent unto you for the same purpose , that ye might know our affairs , and that he might comfort your hearts .
for the hurt of the daughter of my people am i hurt ; i am black ; astonishment hath taken hold on me .
but that ye also may know my affairs , and how i do , tychicus , a beloved brother and faithful minister in the lord , shall make known to you all things :
is there no balm in gilead ; is there no physician there ? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered ?
grace be with all them that love our lord jesus christ in sincerity . amen .
peace be to the brethren , and love with faith , from god the father and the lord jesus christ .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the great trumpet shall be blown , and they shall come which were ready to perish in the land of assyria , and the outcasts in the land of egypt , and shall worship the lord in the holy mount at jerusalem .
yet the defenced city shall be desolate , and the habitation forsaken , and left like a wilderness : there shall the calf feed , and there shall he lie down , and consume the branches thereof .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the lord shall beat off from the channel of the river unto the stream of egypt , and ye shall be gathered one by one , o ye children of israel .
and for me , that utterance may be given unto me , that i may open my mouth boldly , to make known the mystery of the gospel ,
praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit , and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints ;
and take the helmet of salvation , and the sword of the spirit , which is the word of god :
above all , taking the shield of faith , wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked .
and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace ;
stand therefore , having your loins girt about with truth , and having on the breastplate of righteousness ;
wherefore take unto you the whole armour of god , that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day , and having done all , to stand .
were they ashamed when they had committed abomination ? nay , they were not at all ashamed , neither could they blush : therefore shall they fall among them that fall : in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down , saith the lord .
for we wrestle not against flesh and blood , but against principalities , against powers , against the rulers of the darkness of this world , against spiritual wickedness in high places .
put on the whole armour of god , that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil .
therefore will i give their wives unto others , and their fields to them that shall inherit them : for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness , from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely .
finally , my brethren , be strong in the lord , and in the power of his might .
for they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly , saying , peace , peace ; when there is no peace .
the snorting of his horses was heard from dan : the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones ; for they are come , and have devoured the land , and all that is in it ; the city , and those that dwell therein .
for , behold , i will send serpents , cockatrices , among you , which will not be charmed , and they shall bite you , saith the lord .
why do we sit still ? assemble yourselves , and let us enter into the defenced cities , and let us be silent there : for the lord our god hath put us to silence , and given us water of gall to drink , because we have sinned against the lord .
we looked for peace , but no good came ; and for a time of health , and behold trouble !
lord , i have hoped for thy salvation , and done thy commandments .
my soul hath kept thy testimonies ; and i love them exceedingly .
i have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies : for all my ways are before thee .
let my cry come near before thee , o lord : give me understanding according to thy word .
for this god is our god for ever and ever : he will be our guide even unto death .
mark ye well her bulwarks , consider her palaces ; that ye may tell it to the generation following .
let mount zion rejoice , let the daughters of judah be glad , because of thy judgments .
let my supplication come before thee : deliver me according to thy word .
walk about zion , and go round about her : tell the towers thereof .
my tongue shall speak of thy word : for all thy commandments are righteousness .
according to thy name , o god , so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth : thy right hand is full of righteousness .
my lips shall utter praise , when thou hast taught me thy statutes .
i have longed for thy salvation , o lord ; and thy law is my delight .
let thine hand help me ; for i have chosen thy precepts .
i have gone astray like a lost sheep ; seek thy servant ; for i do not forget thy commandments .
and abraham hearkened unto ephron ; and abraham weighed to ephron the silver , which he had named in the audience of the sons of heth , four hundred shekels of silver , current money with the merchant .
and the field of ephron , which was in machpelah , which was before mamre , the field , and the cave which was therein , and all the trees that were in the field , that were in all the borders round about , were made sure
unto abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of heth , before all that went in at the gate of his city .
and after this , abraham buried sarah his wife in the cave of the field of machpelah before mamre : the same is hebron in the land of canaan .
and ephron dwelt among the children of heth : and ephron the hittite answered abraham in the audience of the children of heth , even of all that went in at the gate of his city , saying ,
nay , my lord , hear me : the field give i thee , and the cave that is therein , i give it thee ; in the presence of the sons of my people give i it thee : bury thy dead .
and abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land .
and he spake unto ephron in the audience of the people of the land , saying , but if thou wilt give it , i pray thee , hear me : i will give thee money for the field ; take it of me , and i will bury my dead there .
my lord , hearken unto me : the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver ; what is that betwixt me and thee ? bury therefore thy dead .
for as many of you as have been baptized into christ have put on christ .
there is neither jew nor greek , there is neither bond nor free , there is neither male nor female : for ye are all one in christ jesus .
and if ye be christ ' s , then are ye abraham ' s seed , and heirs according to the promise .
but before faith came , we were kept under the law , shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed .
wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto christ , that we might be justified by faith .
but after that faith is come , we are no longer under a schoolmaster .
for ye are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus .
now a mediator is not a mediator of one , but god is one .
but the scripture hath concluded all under sin , that the promise by faith of jesus christ might be given to them that believe .
so they took the king , and brought him up to the king of babylon to riblah ; and they gave judgment upon him .
then the king said to haman , make haste , and take the apparel and the horse , as thou hast said , and do even so to mordecai the jew , that sitteth at the king ' s gate : let nothing fail of all that thou has spoken .
and the army of the chaldees pursued after the king , and overtook him in the plains of jericho : and all his army were scattered from him .
and in the fifth month , on the seventh day of the month , which is the nineteenth year of king nebuchadnezzar king of babylon , came nebuzar - adan , captain of the guard , a servant of the king of babylon , unto jerusalem :
and they slew the sons of zedekiah before his eyes , and put out the eyes of zedekiah , and bound him with fetters of brass , and carried him to babylon .
and the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king zedekiah .
and while they were yet talking with him , came the king ' s chamberlains , and hasted to bring haman unto the banquet that esther had prepared .
and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came , he , and all his host , against jerusalem , and pitched against it ; and they built forts against it round about .
and the city was broken up , and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between two walls , which is by the king ' s garden : ( now the chaldees were against the city round about : ) and the king went the way toward the plain .
and mordecai came again to the king ' s gate . but haman hasted to his house mourning , and having his head covered .
and on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in the city , and there was no bread for the people of the land .
then took haman the apparel and the horse , and arrayed mordecai , and brought him on horseback through the street of the city , and proclaimed before him , thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour .
and he burnt the house of the lord , and the king ' s house , and all the houses of jerusalem , and every great man ' s house burnt he with fire .
and when the king asked the woman , she told him . so the king appointed unto her a certain officer , saying , restore all that was hers , and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land , even until now .
and elisha came to damascus ; and ben - hadad the king of syria was sick ; and it was told him , saying , the man of god is come hither .
and the king talked with gehazi the servant of the man of god , saying , tell me , i pray thee , all the great things that elisha hath done .
and the woman arose , and did after the saying of the man of god : and she went with her household , and sojourned in the land of the philistines seven years .
wherefore then serveth the law ? it was added because of transgressions , till the seed should come to whom the promise was made ; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator .
and it came to pass at the seven years ' end , that the woman returned out of the land of the philistines : and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land .
now to abraham and his seed were the promises made . he saith not , and to seeds , as of many ; but as of one , and to thy seed , which is christ .
and this i say , that the covenant , that was confirmed before of god in christ , the law , which was four hundred and thirty years after , cannot disannul , that it should make the promise of none effect .
that the blessing of abraham might come on the gentiles through jesus christ ; that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith .
brethren , i speak after the manner of men ; though it be but a man ' s covenant , yet if it be confirmed , no man disannulleth , or addeth thereto .
and the law is not of faith : but , the man that doeth them shall live in them .
christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law , being made a curse for us : for it is written , cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree :
for as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse : for it is written , cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them .
but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of god , it is evident : for , the just shall live by faith .
and the king said unto hazael , take a present in thine hand , and go , meet the man of god , and inquire of the lord by him , saying , shall i recover of this disease ?
so hazael went to meet him , and took a present with him , even of every good thing of damascus , forty camels ' burden , and came and stood before him , and said , thy son ben - hadad king of syria hath sent me to thee , saying , shall i recover of this disease ?
and afterward the children of judah went down to fight against the canaanites , that dwelt in the mountain , and in the south , and in the valley .
now the children of judah had fought against jerusalem , and had taken it , and smitten it with the edge of the sword , and set the city on fire .
and adoni - bezek said , threescore and ten kings , having their thumbs and their great toes cut off , gathered their meat under my table : as i have done , so god hath requited me . and they brought him to jerusalem , and there he died .
but adoni - bezek fled ; and they pursued after him , and caught him , and cut off his thumbs and his great toes .
and they found adoni - bezek in bezek : and they fought against him , and they slew the canaanites and the perizzites .
and judah went up ; and the lord delivered the canaanites and the perizzites into their hand : and they slew of them in bezek ten thousand men .
and judah said unto simeon his brother , come up with me into my lot , that we may fight against the canaanites ; and i likewise will go with thee into thy lot . so simeon went with him .
and the lord said , judah shall go up : behold , i have delivered the land into his hand .
now after the death of joshua it came to pass , that the children of israel asked the lord , saying , who shall go up for us against the canaanites first , to fight against them ?
and the field , and the cave that is therein , were made sure unto abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of heth .
the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom : a good understanding have all they that do his commandments : his praise endureth for ever .
the wicked have laid a snare for me : yet i erred not from thy precepts .
i have not departed from thy judgments : for thou hast taught me .
how sweet are thy words unto my taste ! yea , sweeter than honey to my mouth !
i understand more than the ancients , because i keep thy precepts .
now these are the commandments , the statutes , and the judgments , which the lord your god commanded to teach you , that ye might do them in the land whither ye go to possess it :
that thou mightest fear the lord thy god , to keep all his statutes and his commandments , which i command thee , thou , and thy son , and thy son ' s son , all the days of thy life ; and that thy days may be prolonged .
i have sworn , and i will perform it , that i will keep thy righteous judgments .
hear therefore , o israel , and observe to do it ; that it may be well with thee , and that ye may increase mightily , as the lord god of thy fathers hath promised thee , in the land that floweth with milk and honey .
i am afflicted very much : quicken me , o lord , according unto thy word .
hear , o israel : the lord our god is one lord :
through thy precepts i get understanding : therefore i hate every false way .
and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thine heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy might .
thy word is a lamp unto my feet , and a light unto my path .
and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children , and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house , and when thou walkest by the way , and when thou liest down , and when thou risest up .
and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand , and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes .
accept , i beseech thee , the freewill offerings of my mouth , o lord , and teach me thy judgments .
and thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house , and on thy gates .
my soul is continually in my hand : yet do i not forget thy law .
i have done judgment and justice : leave me not to mine oppressors .
my flesh trembleth for fear of thee ; and i am afraid of thy judgments .
concerning the works of men , by the word of thy lips i have kept me from the paths of the destroyer .
hold up my goings in thy paths , that my footsteps slip not .
i have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway , even unto the end .
i have called upon thee , for thou wilt hear me , o god : incline thine ear unto me , and hear my speech .
i hate vain thoughts : but thy law do i love .
thou art my hiding place and my shield : i hope in thy word .
keep me as the apple of the eye , hide me under the shadow of thy wings ,
depart from me , ye evildoers : for i will keep the commandments of my god .
from the wicked that oppress me , from my deadly enemies , who compass me about .
uphold me according unto thy word , that i may live : and let me not be ashamed of my hope .
hold thou me up , and i shall be safe : and i will have respect unto thy statutes continually .
thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes : for their deceit is falsehood .
thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross : therefore i love thy testimonies .
hear the right , o lord , attend unto my cry , give ear unto my prayer , that goeth not out of feigned lips .
let my sentence come forth from thy presence ; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal .
thou has proved mine heart ; thou hast visited me in the night ; thou has tried me , and shalt find nothing ; i am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress .
he hath remembered his covenant for ever , the word which he commanded to a thousand generations .
which covenant he made with abraham , and his oath unto isaac ;
o ye seed of abraham his servant , ye children of jacob his chosen .
he is the lord our god : his judgments are in all the earth .
seek the lord , and his strength : seek his face evermore .
remember his marvellous works that he hath done ; his wonders , and the judgments of his mouth ;
but when that which is perfect is come , then that which is in part shall be done away .
o give thanks unto the lord ; call upon his name : make known his deeds among the people .
when i was a child , i spake as a child , i understood as a child , i thought as a child : but when i became a man , i put away childish things .
glory ye in his holy name : let the heart of them rejoice that seek the lord .
sing unto him , sing psalms unto him : talk ye of all his wondrous works .
and in the seventh year jehoiada strengthened himself , and took the captains of hundreds , azariah the son of jeroham , and ishmael the son of jehohanan , and azariah the son of obed , and maaseiah the son of adaiah , and elishaphat the son of zichri , into covenant with him .
and the levites shall compass the king round about , every man with his weapons in his hand ; and whosoever else cometh into the house , he shall be put to death : but be ye with the king when he cometh in , and when he goeth out .
but let none come into the house of the lord , save the priests , and they that minister of the levites ; they shall go in , for they are holy : but all the people shall keep the watch of the lord .
moreover jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears , and bucklers , and shields , that had been king david ' s , which were in the house of god .
so the levites and all judah did according to all things that jehoiada the priest had commanded , and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath , with them that were to go out on the sabbath : for jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses .
and all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of god . and he said unto them , behold , the king ' s son shall reign , as the lord hath said of the sons of david .
and they went about in judah , and gathered the levites out of all the cities of judah , and the chief of the fathers of israel , and they came to jerusalem .
and now abideth faith , hope , charity , these three ; but the greatest of these is charity .
and a third part shall be at the king ' s house ; and a third part at the gate of the foundation : and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the lord .
for now we see through a glass , darkly ; but then face to face : now i know in part ; but then shall i know even as also i am known .
this is the thing that ye shall do ; a third part of you entering on the sabbath , of the priests and of the levites , shall be porters of the doors ;
saying with a loud voice , worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive power , and riches , and wisdom , and strength , and honour , and glory , and blessing .
and i beheld , and i heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders : and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand , and thousands of thousands ;
and jacob lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , behold , esau came , and with him four hundred men . and he divided the children unto leah , and unto rachel , and unto the two handmaids .
and the four beasts said , amen . and the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever .
and he put the handmaids and their children foremost , and leah and her children after , and rachel and joseph hindermost .
and he passed over before them , and bowed himself to the ground seven times , until he came near to his brother .
and those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem , according to thine estimation , for the money of five shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary , which is twenty gerahs .
but the firstling of a cow , or the firstling of a sheep , or the firstling of a goat , thou shalt not redeem ; they are holy : thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar , and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire , for a sweet savour unto the lord .
and the flesh of them shall be thine , as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are thine .
all the heave offerings of the holy things , which the children of israel offer unto the lord , have i given thee , and thy sons and thy daughters with thee , by a statute for ever : it is a covenant of salt for ever before the lord unto thee and to thy seed with thee .
and this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the lord of hosts in shiloh . and the two sons of eli , hophni and phinehas , the priests of the lord , were there .
and esau said , i have enough , my brother ; keep that thou hast unto thyself .
and he had two wives ; the name of the one was hannah , and the name of the other peninnah : and peninnah had children , but hannah had no children .
and he said , what meanest thou by all this drove which i met ? and he said , these are to find grace in the sight of my lord .
now there was a certain man of ramathaim - zophim , of mount ephraim , and his name was elkanah , the son of jeroham , the son of elihu , the son of tohu , the son of zuph , an ephrathite :
in the most holy place shalt thou eat it ; every male shall eat it : it shall be holy unto thee .
and this is thine ; the heave offering of their gift , with all the wave offerings of the children of israel : i have given them unto thee , and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee , by a statute for ever : every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it .
and as he did so year by year , when she went up to the house of the lord , so she provoked her ; therefore she wept , and did not eat .
and he lifted up his eyes , and saw the women and the children ; and said , who are those with thee ? and he said , the children which god hath graciously given thy servant .
all the best of the oil , and all the best of the wine , and of the wheat , the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the lord , them have i given thee .
and her adversary also provoked her sore , for to make her fret , because the lord had shut up her womb .
and esau ran to meet him , and embraced him , and fell on his neck , and kissed him : and they wept .
and whatsoever is first ripe in the land , which they shall bring unto the lord , shall be thine ; every one that is clean in thine house shall eat of it .
but unto hannah he gave a worthy portion ; for he loved hannah : but the lord had shut up her womb .
and leah also with her children came near , and bowed themselves : and after came joseph near and rachel , and they bowed themselves .
every thing devoted in israel shall be thine .
and hast made us unto our god kings and priests : and we shall reign on the earth .
and when the time was that elkanah offered , he gave to peninnah his wife , and to all her sons and her daughters , portions :
then the handmaidens came near , they and their children , and they bowed themselves .
every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh , which they bring unto the lord , whether it be of men or beasts , shall be thine : nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem , and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem .
the wise in heart shall be called prudent : and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning .
he that handleth a matter wisely shall find good : and whoso trusteth in the lord , happy is he .
there is a way that seemeth right unto a man , but the end thereof are the ways of death .
pleasant words are as an honeycomb , sweet to the soul , and health to the bones .
the heart of the wise teacheth his mouth , and addeth learning to his lips .
understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it : but the instruction of fools is folly .
the highway of the upright is to depart from evil : he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul .
pride goeth before destruction , and an haughty spirit before a fall .
in the light of the king ' s countenance is life ; and his favour is as a cloud of the latter rain .
how much better is it to get wisdom than gold ! and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver !
thou whom i have taken from the ends of the earth , and called thee from the chief men thereof , and said unto thee , thou art my servant ; i have chosen thee , and not cast thee away .
but thou , israel , art my servant , jacob whom i have chosen , the seed of abraham my friend .
better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly , than to divide the spoil with the proud .
so the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith , and he that smootheth with the hammer him that smote the anvil , saying , it is ready for the sodering : and he fastened it with nails , that it should not be moved .
they helped every one his neighbour ; and every one said to his brother , be of good courage .
the isles saw it , and feared ; the ends of the earth were afraid , drew near , and came .
that pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor , and turn aside the way of the meek : and a man and his father will go in unto the same maid , to profane my holy name :
who hath wrought and done it , calling the generations from the beginning ? i the lord , the first , and with the last ; i am he .
and they lay themselves down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar , and they drink the wine of the condemned in the house of their god .
he pursued them , and passed safely ; even by the way that he had not gone with his feet .
yet destroyed i the amorite before them , whose height was like the height of the cedars , and he was strong as the oaks ; yet i destroyed his fruit from above , and his roots from beneath .
who raised up the righteous man from the east , called him to his foot , gave the nations before him , and made him rule over kings ? he gave them as the dust to his sword , and as driven stubble to his bow .
therefore thou shalt say unto them , when ye have heaved the best thereof from it , then it shall be counted unto the levites as the increase of the threshingfloor , and as the increase of the winepress .
keep silence before me , o islands ; and let the people renew their strength : let them come near ; then let them speak : let us come near together to judgment .
and i will cut off the judge from the midst thereof , and will slay all the princes thereof with him , saith the lord .
and ye shall eat it in every place , ye and your households : for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation .
thus saith the lord ; for three transgressions of judah , and for four , i will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they have despised the law of the lord , and have not kept his commandments , and their lies caused them to err , after the which their fathers have walked :
and ye shall bear no sin by reason of it , when ye have heaved from it the best of it : neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of israel , lest ye die .
but i will send a fire upon judah , and it shall devour the palaces of jerusalem .
thus saith the lord ; for three transgressions of israel , and for four , i will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they sold the righteous for silver , and the poor for a pair of shoes ;
but i will send a fire upon moab , and it shall devour the palaces of kerioth : and moab shall die with tumult , with shouting , and with the sound of the trumpet :
thus saith the lord ; for three transgressions of moab , and for four , i will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because he burned the bones of the king of edom into lime :
a divine sentence is in the lips of the king : his mouth transgresseth not in judgment .
it is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness : for the throne is established by righteousness .
a just weight and balance are the lord ' s : all the weights of the bag are his work .
the wrath of a king is as messengers of death : but a wise man will pacify it .
righteous lips are the delight of kings ; and they love him that speaketh right .
thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the lord of all your tithes , which ye receive of the children of israel ; and ye shall give thereof the lord ' s heave offering to aaron the priest .
but the levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation , and they shall bear their iniquity : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations , that among the children of israel they have no inheritance .
but the tithes of the children of israel , which they offer as an heave offering unto the lord , i have given to the levites to inherit : therefore i have said unto them , among the children of israel they shall have no inheritance .
and , behold , i have given the children of levi all the tenth in israel for an inheritance , for their service which they serve , even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation .
neither must the children of israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation , lest they bear sin , and die .
and the lord spake unto aaron , thou shalt have no inheritance in their land , neither shalt thou have any part among them : i am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of israel .
the lot is cast into the lap ; but the whole disposing thereof is of the lord .
he shutteth his eyes to devise froward things : moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass .
the hoary head is a crown of glory , if it be found in the way of righteousness .
he that is slow to anger is better than the mighty ; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city .
and david heard in the wilderness that nabal did shear his sheep .
and david sent out ten young men , and david said unto the young men , get you up to carmel , and go to nabal , and greet him in my name :
and thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity , peace be both to thee , and peace be to thine house , and peace be unto all that thou hast .
and now i have heard that thou hast shearers : now thy shepherds which were with us , we hurt them not , neither was there ought missing unto them , all the while they were in carmel .
and samuel died ; and all the israelites were gathered together , and lamented him , and buried him in his house at ramah . and david arose , and went down to the wilderness of paran .
and there was a man in maon , whose possessions were in carmel ; and the man was very great , and he had three thousand sheep , and a thousand goats : and he was shearing his sheep in carmel .
now the name of the man was nabal ; and the name of his wife abigail : and she was a woman of good understanding , and of a beautiful countenance : but the man was churlish and evil in his doings ; and he was of the house of caleb .
ask thy young men , and they will shew thee . wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes : for we come in a good day : give , i pray thee , whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants , and to thy son david .
an ungodly man diggeth up evil : and in his lips there is as a burning fire .
and when david ' s young men came , they spake to nabal according to all those words in the name of david , and ceased .
he that laboureth laboureth for himself ; for his mouth craveth it of him .
a violent man enticeth his neighbour , and leadeth him into the way that is not good .
a froward man soweth strife : and a whisperer separateth chief friends .
but when he defied israel , jonathan the son of shimea david ' s brother slew him .
and yet again there was war at gath , where was a man of great stature , whose fingers and toes were four and twenty , six on each hand , and six on each foot : and he also was the son of the giant .
and there was war again with the philistines ; and elhanan the son of jair slew lahmi the brother of goliath the gittite , whose spear staff was like a weaver ' s beam .
and it came to pass after this , that there arose war at gezer with the philistines ; at which time sibbechai the hushathite slew sippai , that was of the children of the giant : and they were subdued .
these were born unto the giant in gath ; and they fell by the hand of david , and by the hand of his servants .
and he brought out the people that were in it , and cut them with saws , and with harrows of iron , and with axes . even so dealt david with all the cities of the children of ammon . and david and all the people returned to jerusalem .
and david took the crown of their king from off his head , and found it to weigh a talent of gold , and there were precious stones in it ; and it was set upon david ' s head : and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city .
hath walked in my statutes , and hath kept my judgments , to deal truly ; he is just , he shall surely live , saith the lord god .
and hath not oppressed any , but hath restored to the debtor his pledge , hath spoiled none by violence , hath given his bread to the hungry , and hath covered the naked with a garment ;
he that hath not given forth upon usury , neither hath taken any increase , that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity , hath executed true judgment between man and man ,
but if a man be just , and do that which is lawful and right ,
and hath not eaten upon the mountains , neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of israel , neither hath defiled his neighbour ' s wife , neither hath come near to a menstruous woman ,
as i live , saith the lord god , ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in israel .
behold , all souls are mine ; as the soul of the father , so also the soul of the son is mine : the soul that sinneth , it shall die .
the word of the lord came unto me again , saying ,
what mean ye , that ye use this proverb concerning the land of israel , saying , the fathers have eaten sour grapes , and the children ' s teeth are set on edge ?
and seeing the multitudes , he went up into a mountain : and when he was set , his disciples came unto him :
and he opened his mouth , and taught them , saying ,
and thou mourn at the last , when thy flesh and thy body are consumed ,
lest strangers be filled with thy wealth ; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger ;
drink waters out of thine own cistern , and running waters out of thine own well .
let thy fountains be dispersed abroad , and rivers of waters in the streets .
and have not obeyed the voice of my teachers , nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me !
i was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly .
let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe ; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times ; and be thou ravished always with her love .
let them be only thine own , and not strangers ' with thee .
let thy fountain be blessed : and rejoice with the wife of thy youth .
for then would they not have ceased to be offered ? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins .
the eye that mocketh at his father , and despiseth to obey his mother , the ravens of the valley shall pick it out , and the young eagles shall eat it .
but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year .
there be three things which are too wonderful for me , yea , four which i know not :
for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins .
the horseleach hath two daughters , crying , give , give . there are three things that are never satisfied , yea , four things say not , it is enough :
wherefore when he cometh into the world , he saith , sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not , but a body hast thou prepared me :
the grave ; and the barren womb ; the earth that is not filled with water ; and the fire that saith not , it is enough .
in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure .
then said i , lo , i come ( in the volume of the book it is written of me , ) to do thy will , o god .
above when he said , sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not , neither hadst pleasure therein ; which are offered by the law ;
the way of an eagle in the air ; the way of a serpent upon a rock ; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea ; and the way of a man with a maid .
then said he , lo , i come to do thy will , o god . he taketh away the first , that he may establish the second .
accuse not a servant unto his master , lest he curse thee , and thou be found guilty .
there is a generation , o how lofty are their eyes ! and their eyelids are lifted up .
there is a generation , whose teeth are as swords , and their jaw teeth as knives , to devour the poor from off the earth , and the needy from among men .
and the rest of the acts of hezekiah , and all his might , and how he made a pool , and a conduit , and brought water into the city , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah ?
there is a generation that curseth their father , and doth not bless their mother .
for the law having a shadow of good things to come , and not the very image of the things , can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect .
and hezekiah slept with his fathers : and manasseh his son reigned in his stead .
there is a generation that are pure in their own eyes , and yet is not washed from their filthiness .
and why wilt thou , my son , be ravished with a strange woman , and embrace the bosom of a stranger ?
for the ways of man are before the eyes of the lord , and he pondereth all his goings .
his own iniquities shall take the wicked himself , and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins .
he shall die without instruction ; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray .
and all the acts of his power and of his might , and the declaration of the greatness of mordecai , whereunto the king advanced him , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of media and persia ?

blessed are the merciful : for they shall obtain mercy .
blessed are the pure in heart : for they shall see god .
blessed are the meek : for they shall inherit the earth .
for mordecai the jew was next unto king ahasuerus , and great among the jews , and accepted of the multitude of his brethren , seeking the wealth of his people , and speaking peace to all his seed .

blessed are the poor in spirit : for theirs is the kingdom of heaven .
blessed are they that mourn : for they shall be comforted .
and so did he unto them , and delivered them out of the hand of the children of israel , that they slew them not .
and now , behold , we are in thine hand : as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us , do .
and joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation , and for the altar of the lord , even unto this day , in the place which he should choose .
and joshua called for them , and he spake unto them , saying , wherefore have ye beguiled us , saying , we are very far from you ; when ye dwell among us ?
and the princes said unto them , let them live ; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation ; as the princes had promised them .
now therefore ye are cursed , and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen , and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my god .
surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter , and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood : so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife .
a greyhound ; an he goat also ; and a king , against whom there is no rising up .
if thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself , or if thou hast thought evil , lay thine hand upon thy mouth .
a lion which is strongest among beasts , and turneth not away for any ;
but all the princes said unto all the congregation , we have sworn unto them by the lord god of israel : now therefore we may not touch them .
and the children of israel smote them not , because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the lord god of israel . and all the congregation murmured against the princes .
and the children of israel journeyed , and came unto their cities on the third day . now their cities were gibeon , and chephirah , and beeroth , and kirjath - jearim .
and they journeyed : and the terror of god was upon the cities that were round about them , and they did not pursue after the sons of jacob .
and it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them , that they heard that they were their neighbours , and that they dwelt among them .
then jacob said unto his household , and to all that were with him , put away the strange gods that are among you , and be clean , and change your garments :
and joshua made peace with them , and made a league with them , to let them live : and the princes of the congregation sware unto them .
and the men took of their victuals , and asked not counsel at the mouth of the lord .
but deborah rebekah ' s nurse died , and she was buried beneath bethel under an oak : and the name of it was called allon - bachuth .
and these bottles of wine , which we filled , were new ; and , behold , they be rent : and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey .
and god appeared unto jacob again , when he came out of padan - aram , and blessed him .
this our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you ; but now , behold , it is dry , and it is mouldy :
so jacob came to luz , which is in the land of canaan , that is , bethel , he and all the people that were with him .
wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us , saying , take victuals with you for the journey , and go to meet them , and say unto them , we are your servants : therefore now make ye a league with us .
and he built there an altar , and called the place el - beth - el : because there god appeared unto him , when he fled from the face of his brother .
and all that he did to the two kings of the amorites , that were beyond jordan , to sihon king of heshbon , and to og king of bashan , which was at ashtaroth .
this we will do to them ; we will even let them live , lest wrath be upon us , because of the oath which we sware unto them .
and god said unto jacob , arise , go up to bethel , and dwell there : and make there an altar unto god , that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of esau thy brother .
the conies are but a feeble folk , yet make they their houses in the rocks ;
the locusts have no king , yet go they forth all of them by bands ;
the spider taketh hold with her hands , and is in kings ' palaces .
there be three things which go well , yea , four are comely in going :
for a servant when he reigneth ; and a fool when he is filled with meat ;
for an odious woman when she is married ; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress .
there be four things which are little upon the earth , but they are exceeding wise :
the ants are a people not strong , yet they prepare their meat in the summer ;
such is the way of an adulterous woman ; she eateth , and wipeth her mouth , and saith , i have done no wickedness .
for three things the earth is disquieted , and for four which it cannot bear :
but if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard them ; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows , or concerning the bond of her soul , shall not stand : her husband hath made them void ; and the lord shall forgive her .
when the lord turned again the captivity of zion , we were like them that dream .
every vow , and every binding oath to afflict the soul , her husband may establish it , or her husband may make it void .
then was our mouth filled with laughter , and our tongue with singing : then said they among the heathen , the lord hath done great things for them .
the lord hath done great things for us ; whereof we are glad .
and her husband heard it , and held his peace at her , and disallowed her not : then all her vows shall stand , and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand .
turn again our captivity , o lord , as the streams in the south .
and moses called all israel , and said unto them , hear , o israel , the statutes and judgments which i speak in your ears this day , that ye may learn them , and keep , and do them .
i am the lord thy god , which brought thee out of the land of egypt , from the house of bondage .
( i stood between the lord and you at that time , to shew you the work of the lord : for ye were afraid by reason of the fire , and went not up into the mount ; ) saying ,
the lord talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire ,
the lord made not this covenant with our fathers , but with us , even us , who are all of us here alive this day .
in the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the trespass offering : and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about upon the altar .
and he shall offer of it all the fat thereof ; the rump , and the fat that covereth the inwards ,
thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them , nor serve them : for i the lord thy god am a jealous god , visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me ,
thou shalt not make thee any graven image , or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above , or that is in the earth beneath , or that is in the waters beneath the earth :
likewise this is the law of the trespass offering : it is most holy .
thou shalt have none other gods before me .
he that goeth forth and weepeth , bearing precious seed , shall doubtless come again with rejoicing , bringing his sheaves with him .
they that sow in tears shall reap in joy .
the meek also shall increase their joy in the lord , and the poor among men shall rejoice in the holy one of israel .
and in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book , and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity , and out of darkness .
is it not yet a very little while , and lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field , and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest ?
surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter ' s clay : for shall the work say of him that made it , he made me not ? or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it , he had no understanding ?
woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the lord , and their works are in the dark , and they say , who seeth us ? and who knoweth us ?
he that putteth not out his money to usury , nor taketh reward against the innocent . he that doeth these things shall never be moved .
therefore , behold , i will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people , even a marvellous work and a wonder : for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish , and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid .
in whose eyes a vile person is contemned ; but he honoureth them that fear the lord . he that sweareth to his own hurt , and changeth not .
wherefore the lord said , forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth , and with their lips do honour me , but have removed their heart far from me , and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men :
he that backbiteth not with his tongue , nor doeth evil to his neighbour , nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour .
and the book is delivered to him that is not learned , saying , read this , i pray thee : and he saith , i am not learned .
and the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed , which men deliver to one that is learned , saying , read this , i pray thee : and he saith , i cannot ; for it is sealed :
lord , who shall abide in thy tabernacle ? who shall dwell in thy holy hill ?
for the lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep , and hath closed your eyes : the prophets and your rulers , the seers hath he covered .
and the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto the lord : it is a trespass offering .
and the two kidneys , and the fat that is on them , which is by the flanks , and the caul that is above the liver , with the kidneys , it shall he take away :
as the sin offering is , so is the trespass offering : there is one law for them : the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have it .
every male among the priests shall eat thereof : it shall be eaten in the holy place : it is most holy .
and all the meat offering that is baken in the oven , and all that is dressed in the fryingpan , and in the pan , shall be the priest ' s that offereth it .
and the priest that offereth any man ' s burnt offering , even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath offered .
at that time berodach - baladan , the son of baladan , king of babylon , sent letters and a present unto hezekiah : for he had heard that hezekiah had been sick .
and isaiah the prophet cried unto the lord : and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward , by which it had gone down in the dial of ahaz .
and hezekiah answered , it is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees : nay , but let the shadow return backward ten degrees .
but if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard them ; then he shall bear her iniquity .
but when he seeth his children , the work of mine hands , in the midst of him , they shall sanctify my name , and sanctify the holy one of jacob , and shall fear the god of israel .
then said hezekiah unto isaiah , good is the word of the lord which thou hast spoken . and he said , is it not good , if peace and truth be in my days ?
but if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day ; then he establisheth all her vows , or all her bonds , which are upon her : he confirmeth them , because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them .
therefore thus saith the lord , who redeemed abraham , concerning the house of jacob , jacob shall not now be ashamed , neither shall his face now wax pale .
and of thy sons that shall issue from thee , which thou shalt beget , shall they take away ; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of babylon .
behold , the days come , that all that is in thine house , and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day , shall be carried into babylon : nothing shall be left , saith the lord .
these are the statutes , which the lord commanded moses , between a man and his wife , between the father and his daughter , being yet in her youth in her father ' s house .
they also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding , and they that murmured shall learn doctrine .
and isaiah said unto hezekiah , hear the word of the lord .
and he said , what have they seen in thine house ? and hezekiah answered , all the things that are in mine house have they seen : there is nothing among my treasures that i have not shewed them .
then came isaiah the prophet unto king hezekiah , and said unto him , what said these men ? and from whence came they unto thee ? and hezekiah said , they are come from a far country , even from babylon .
that make a man an offender for a word , and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate , and turn aside the just for a thing of nought .
for the terrible one is brought to nought , and the scorner is consumed , and all that watch for iniquity are cut off :
and ye shall teach them your children , speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house , and when thou walkest by the way , when thou liest down , and when thou risest up .
for the land , whither thou goest in to possess it , is not as the land of egypt , from whence ye came out , where thou sowedst thy seed , and wateredst it with thy foot , as a garden of herbs :
and then the lord ' s wrath be kindled against you , and he shut up the heaven , that there be no rain , and that the land yield not her fruit ; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the lord giveth you .
therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul , and bind them for a sign upon your hand , that they may be as frontlets between your eyes .
and i will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle , that thou mayest eat and be full .
take heed to yourselves , that your heart be not deceived , and ye turn aside , and serve other gods , and worship them ;
and it shall come to pass , if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which i command you this day , to love the lord your god , and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul ,
that i will give you the rain of your land in his due season , the first rain and the latter rain , that thou mayest gather in thy corn , and thy wine , and thine oil .
but the land , whither ye go to possess it , is a land of hills and valleys , and drinketh water of the rain of heaven :
a land which the lord thy god careth for : the eyes of the lord thy god are always upon it , from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year .
for ye shall pass over jordan to go in to possess the land which the lord your god giveth you , and ye shall possess it , and dwell therein .
and ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which i set before you this day .
are they not on the other side jordan , by the way where the sun goeth down , in the land of the canaanites , which dwell in the champaign over against gilgal , beside the plains of moreh ?
to receive the instruction of wisdom , justice , and judgment , and equity ;
to know wisdom and instruction ; to perceive the words of understanding ;
a wise man will hear , and will increase learning ; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels :
to give subtilty to the simple , to the young man knowledge and discretion .
the fear of the lord is the beginning of knowledge : but fools despise wisdom and instruction .
to understand a proverb , and the interpretation ; the words of the wise , and their dark sayings .
for they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head , and chains about thy neck .
the proverbs of solomon the son of david , king of israel ;
and thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house , and upon thy gates :
that your days may be multiplied , and the days of your children , in the land which the lord sware unto your fathers to give them , as the days of heaven upon the earth .
for if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which i command you , to do them , to love the lord your god , to walk in all his ways , and to cleave unto him ;
then will the lord drive out all these nations from before you , and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves .
every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours : from the wilderness and lebanon , from the river , the river euphrates , even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be .
there shall no man be able to stand before you : for the lord your god shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon , as he hath said unto you .
behold , i set before you this day a blessing and a curse ;
a blessing , if ye obey the commandments of the lord your god , which i command you this day :
and a curse , if ye will not obey the commandments of the lord your god , but turn aside out of the way which i command you this day , to go after other gods , which ye have not known .
and it shall come to pass , when the lord thy god hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it , that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount gerizim , and the curse upon mount ebal .
then job answered the lord , and said ,
i know that thou canst do every thing , and that no thought can be withholden from thee .
and the number of the burnt offerings , which the congregation brought , was threescore and ten bullocks , an hundred rams , and two hundred lambs : all these were for a burnt offering to the lord .
then hezekiah answered and said , now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the lord , come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the lord . and the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings ; and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings .
moreover hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the levites to sing praise unto the lord with the words of david , and of asaph the seer . and they sang praises with gladness , and they bowed their heads and worshipped .
then they said one to another , we do not well : this day is a day of good tidings , and we hold our peace : if we tarry till the morning light , some mischief will come upon us : now therefore come , that we may go and tell the king ' s household .
and hezekiah rejoiced , and all the people , that god had prepared the people : for the thing was done suddenly .
and also the burnt offerings were in abundance , with the fat of the peace offerings , and the drink offerings for every burnt offering . so the service of the house of the lord was set in order .
but the priests were too few , so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings : wherefore their brethren the levites did help them , till the work was ended , and until the other priests had sanctified themselves : for the levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests .
and the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep .
and there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate : and they said one to another , why sit we here until we die ?
then elisha said , hear ye the word of the lord ; thus saith the lord , to morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel , and two measures of barley for a shekel , in the gate of samaria .
then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of god , and said , behold , if the lord would make windows in heaven , might this thing be ? and he said , behold , thou shalt see it with thine eyes , but shalt not eat thereof .
wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight , and left their tents , and their horses , and their asses , even the camp as it was , and fled for their life .
and they rose up in the twilight , to go unto the camp of the syrians : and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of syria , behold , there was no man there .
and god was displeased with this thing ; therefore he smote israel .
and david said unto god , i have sinned greatly , because i have done this thing : but now , i beseech thee , do away the iniquity of thy servant ; for i have done very foolishly .
and the lord spake unto gad , david ' s seer , saying ,
and joab answered , the lord make his people an hundred times so many more as they be : but , my lord the king , are they not all my lord ' s servants ? why then doth my lord require this thing ? why will he be a cause of trespass to israel ?
nevertheless the king ' s word prevailed against joab . wherefore joab departed , and went throughout all israel , and came to jerusalem .
and joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto david . and all they of israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword : and judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword .
but levi and benjamin counted he not among them : for the king ' s word was abominable to joab .
and satan stood up against israel , and provoked david to number israel .
and david said to joab and to the rulers of the people , go , number israel from beer - sheba even to dan ; and bring the number of them to me , that i may know it .
and they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering before the king and the congregation ; and they laid their hands upon them :
and he set the levites in the house of the lord with cymbals , with psalteries , and with harps , according to the commandment of david , and of gad the king ' s seer , and nathan the prophet : for so was the commandment of the lord by his prophets .
and they brought seven bullocks , and seven rams , and seven lambs , and seven he goats , for a sin offering for the kingdom , and for the sanctuary , and for judah . and he commanded the priests the sons of aaron to offer them on the altar of the lord .
then hezekiah the king rose early , and gathered the rulers of the city , and went up to the house of the lord .
they go up by the mountains ; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them .
at thy rebuke they fled ; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away .
thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment : the waters stood above the mountains .
who laid the foundations of the earth , that it should not be removed for ever .
and hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar . and when the burnt offering began , the song of the lord began also with the trumpets , and with the instruments ordained by david king of israel .
and the levites stood with the instruments of david , and the priests with the trumpets .
and when they had made an end of offering , the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves , and worshipped .
and all the congregation worshipped , and the singers sang , and the trumpeters sounded : and all this continued until the burnt offering was finished .
thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over ; that they turn not again to cover the earth .
bless the lord , o my soul . o lord my god , thou art very great ; thou art clothed with honour and majesty .
who coverest thyself with light as with a garment : who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain :
who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters : who maketh the clouds his chariot : who walketh upon the wings of the wind :
and of the sons of elizaphan ; shimri , and jeiel : and of the sons of asaph ; zechariah , and mattaniah :
my sons , be not now negligent : for the lord hath chosen you to stand before him , to serve him , and that ye should minister unto him , and burn incense .
now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the lord god of israel , that his fierce wrath may turn away from us .
moreover all the vessels , which king ahaz in his reign did cast away in his transgression , have we prepared and sanctified , and , behold , they are before the altar of the lord .
then they went in to hezekiah the king , and said , we have cleansed all the house of the lord , and the altar of burnt offering , with all the vessels thereof , and the shewbread table , with all the vessels thereof .
now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify , and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the lord : so they sanctified the house of the lord in eight days ; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end .
and the priests went into the inner part of the house of the lord , to cleanse it , and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the lord into the court of the house of the lord . and the levites took it , to carry it out abroad into the brook kidron .
and they gathered their brethren , and sanctified themselves , and came , according to the commandment of the king , by the words of the lord , to cleanse the house of the lord .
and the lord sent against him bands of the chaldees , and bands of the syrians , and bands of the moabites , and bands of the children of ammon , and sent them against judah to destroy it , according to the word of the lord , which he spake by his servants the prophets .
surely at the commandment of the lord came this upon judah , to remove them out of his sight , for the sins of manasseh , according to all that he did ;
and i went unto the angel , and said unto him , give me the little book . and he said unto me , take it , and eat it up ; and it shall make thy belly bitter , but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey .
and also for the innocent blood that he shed : for he filled jerusalem with innocent blood ; which the lord would not pardon .
and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again , and said , go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth .
now the rest of the acts of jehoiakim , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah ?
so jehoiakim slept with his fathers : and jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead .
and the king of egypt came not again any more out of his land : for the king of babylon had taken from the river of egypt unto the river euphrates all that pertained to the king of egypt .
jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign , and he reigned in jerusalem three months . and his mother ' s name was nehushta , the daughter of elnathan of jerusalem .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord , according to all that his father had done .
in his days nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came up , and jehoiakim became his servant three years : then he turned and rebelled against him .
now unto the king eternal , immortal , invisible , the only wise god , be honour and glory for ever and ever . amen .
howbeit for this cause i obtained mercy , that in me first jesus christ might shew forth all longsuffering , for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting .
this is a faithful saying , and worthy of all acceptation , that christ jesus came into the world to save sinners ; of whom i am chief .
and the grace of our lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in christ jesus .
who was before a blasphemer , and a persecutor , and injurious : but i obtained mercy , because i did it ignorantly in unbelief .
and i thank christ jesus our lord , who hath enabled me , for that he counted me faithful , putting me into the ministry ;
according to the glorious gospel of the blessed god , which was committed to my trust .
for whoremongers , for them that defile themselves with mankind , for menstealers , for liars , for perjured persons , and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine ;
and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices , i was about to write : and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me , seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered , and write them not .
and the angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven ,
and sware by him that liveth for ever and ever , who created heaven , and the things that therein are , and the earth , and the things that therein are , and the sea , and the things which are therein , that there should be time no longer :
but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel , when he shall begin to sound , the mystery of god should be finished , as he hath declared to his servants the prophets .
and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven , clothed with a cloud : and a rainbow was upon his head , and his face was as it were the sun , and his feet as pillars of fire :
and he had in his hand a little book open : and he set his right foot upon the sea , and his left foot on the earth ,
holding faith , and a good conscience ; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck :
and cried with a loud voice , as when a lion roareth : and when he had cried , seven thunders uttered their voices .
this charge i commit unto thee , son timothy , according to the prophecies which went before on thee , that thou by them mightest war a good warfare ;
and they made a proclamation through judah and jerusalem , to bring in to the lord the collection that moses the servant of god laid upon israel in the wilderness .
of whom is hymenaeus and alexander ; whom i have delivered unto satan , that they may learn not to blaspheme .
and joash did that which was right in the sight of the lord all the days of jehoiada the priest .
and it was so , that after the lord had spoken these words unto job , the lord said to eliphaz the temanite , my wrath is kindled against thee , and against thy two friends : for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right , as my servant job hath .
joash was seven years old when he began to reign , and he reigned forty years in jerusalem . his mother ' s name also was zibiah of beer - sheba .
and it came to pass after this , that joash was minded to repair the house of the lord .
so eliphaz the temanite and bildad the shuhite and zophar the naamathite went , and did according as the lord commanded them : the lord also accepted job .
and jehoiada took for him two wives ; and he begat sons and daughters .
and the king called for jehoiada the chief , and said unto him , why hast thou not required of the levites to bring in out of judah and out of jerusalem the collection , according to the commandment of moses the servant of the lord , and of the congregation of israel , for the tabernacle of witness ?
who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge ? therefore have i uttered that i understood not ; things too wonderful for me , which i knew not .
and he gathered together the priests and the levites , and said to them , go out unto the cities of judah , and gather of all israel money to repair the house of your god from year to year , and see that ye hasten the matter . howbeit the levites hastened it not .
hear , i beseech thee , and i will speak : i will demand of thee , and declare thou unto me .
and at the king ' s commandment they made a chest , and set it without at the gate of the house of the lord .
i have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear : but now mine eye seeth thee .
for the sons of athaliah , that wicked woman , had broken up the house of god ; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the lord did they bestow upon baalim .
and after certain days , when felix came with his wife drusilla , which was a jewess , he sent for paul , and heard him concerning the faith in christ .
and as he reasoned of righteousness , temperance , and judgment to come felix trembled , and answered , go thy way for this time ; when i have a convenient season , i will call for thee .
and when felix heard these things , having more perfect knowledge of that way , he deferred them , and said , when lysias the chief captain shall come down , i will know the uttermost of your matter .
and he commanded a centurion to keep paul , and to let him have liberty , and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him .
or else let these same here say , if they have found any evil doing in me , while i stood before the council ,
and moses sent to call dathan and abiram , the sons of eliab : which said , we will not come up :
except it be for this one voice , that i cried standing among them , touching the resurrection of the dead i am called in question by you this day .
and he hath brought thee near to him , and all thy brethren the sons of levi with thee : and seek ye the priesthood also ?
for which cause both thou and all thy company are gathered together against the lord : and what is aaron , that ye murmur against him ?
and moses said unto korah , be thou and all thy company before the lord , thou , and they , and aaron , to morrow :
and take every man his censer , and put incense in them , and bring ye before the lord every man his censer , two hundred and fifty censers ; thou also , and aaron , each of you his censer .
moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey , or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards : wilt thou put out the eyes of these men ? we will not come up .
and moses was very wroth , and said unto the lord , respect not thou their offering : i have not taken one ass from them , neither have i hurt one of them .
he hoped also that money should have been given him of paul , that he might loose him : wherefore he sent for him the oftener , and communed with him .
and they took every man his censer , and put fire in them , and laid incense thereon , and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with moses and aaron .
but after two years porcius festus came into felix ' room : and felix , willing to shew the jews a pleasure , left paul bound .
and korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation : and the glory of the lord appeared unto all the congregation .
because that thou mayest understand , that there are yet but twelve days since i went up to jerusalem for to worship .
and they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man , neither raising up the people , neither in the synagogues , nor in the city :
neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me .
but this i confess unto thee , that after the way which they call heresy , so worship i the god of my fathers , believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets :
then paul , after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak , answered , forasmuch as i know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation , i do the more cheerfully answer for myself :
who ought to have been here before thee , and object , if they had ought against me .
and have hope toward god , which they themselves also allow , that there shall be a resurrection of the dead , both of the just and unjust .
and herein do i exercise myself , to have always a conscience void of offence toward god , and toward men .
now after many years i came to bring alms to my nation , and offerings .
whereupon certain jews from asia found me purified in the temple , neither with multitude , nor with tumult .
and when he hath taken away the multitude , his heart shall be lifted up ; and he shall cast down many ten thousands : but he shall not be strengthened by it .
for the king of the north shall return , and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former , and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches .
but his sons shall be stirred up , and shall assemble a multitude of great forces : and one shall certainly come , and overflow , and pass through : then shall he return , and be stirred up , even to his fortress .
and the king of the south shall be moved with choler , and shall come forth and fight with him , even with the king of the north : and he shall set forth a great multitude ; but the multitude shall be given into his hand .
after this shall he turn his face unto the isles , and shall take many : but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease ; without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn upon him .
then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land : but he shall stumble and fall , and not be found .
but he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will , and none shall stand before him : and he shall stand in the glorious land , which by his hand shall be consumed .
he shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom , and upright ones with him ; thus shall he do : and he shall give him the daughter of women , corrupting her : but she shall not stand on his side , neither be for him .
and in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south : also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision ; but they shall fall .
but i will send a fire into the house of hazael , which shall devour the palaces of ben - hadad .
i will break also the bar of damascus , and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of aven , and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of eden : and the people of syria shall go into captivity unto kir , saith the lord .
thus saith the lord ; for three transgressions of gaza , and for four , i will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they carried away captive the whole captivity , to deliver them up to edom :
but i will send a fire on the wall of gaza , which shall devour the palaces thereof :
and i will cut off the inhabitant from ashdod , and him that holdeth the sceptre from ashkelon , and i will turn mine hand against ekron : and the remnant of the philistines shall perish , saith the lord god .
thus saith the lord ; for three transgressions of tyrus , and for four , i will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they delivered up the whole captivity to edom , and remembered not the brotherly covenant :
thus saith the lord ; for three transgressions of damascus , and for four , i will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they have threshed gilead with threshing instruments of iron :
and he said , the lord will roar from zion , and utter his voice from jerusalem ; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn , and the top of carmel shall wither .
the words of amos , who was among the herdman of tekoa , which he saw concerning israel in the days of uzziah king of judah , and in the days of jeroboam the son of joash king of israel , two years before the earthquake .
thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god , whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory : and he shall cause them to rule over many , and shall divide the land for gain .
but in his estate shall he honour the god of forces : and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold , and silver , and with precious stones , and pleasant things .
neither shall he regard the god of his fathers , nor the desire of women , nor regard any god : for he shall magnify himself above all .
and the king shall do according to his will ; and he shall exalt himself , and magnify himself above every god , and shall speak marvellous things against the god of gods , and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished : for that that is determined shall be done .
and arms shall stand on his part , and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength , and shall take away the daily sacrifice , and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate .
for the ships of chittim shall come against him : therefore he shall be grieved , and return , and have indignation against the holy covenant : so shall he do ; he shall even return , and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant .
to shew that the lord is upright : he is my rock , and there is no unrighteousness in him .
they shall still bring forth fruit in old age ; they shall be fat and flourishing ;
those that be planted in the house of the lord shall flourish in the courts of our god .
and some of them of understanding shall fall , to try them , and to purge , and to make them white , even to the time of the end : because it is yet for a time appointed .
now when they shall fall , they shall be holpen with a little help : but many shall cleave to them with flatteries .
mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies , and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me .
and they that understand among the people shall instruct many : yet they shall fall by the sword , and by flame , by captivity , and by spoil , many days .
but my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn : i shall be anointed with fresh oil .
and such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries : but the people that do know their god shall be strong , and do exploits .
and aaron returned unto moses unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation : and the plague was stayed .
yea , they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him , and his army shall overflow : and many shall fall down slain .
and he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army ; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army ; but he shall not stand : for they shall forecast devices against him .
then shall he return into his land with great riches ; and his heart shall be against the holy covenant ; and he shall do exploits , and return to his own land .
and both these kings ' hearts shall be to do mischief , and they shall speak lies at one table ; but it shall not prosper : for yet the end shall be at the time appointed .
then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom : but within few days he shall be destroyed , neither in anger , nor in battle .
and with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him , and shall be broken ; yea , also the prince of the covenant .
and in his estate shall stand up a vile person , to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom : but he shall come in peaceably , and obtain the kingdom by flatteries .
and after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully : for he shall come up , and shall become strong with a small people .
and david said to saul , wherefore hearest thou men ' s words , saying , behold , david seeketh thy hurt ?
and he stood between the dead and the living ; and the plague was stayed .
and aaron took as moses commanded , and ran into the midst of the congregation ; and , behold , the plague was begun among the people : and he put on incense , and made an atonement for the people .
and it came to pass , when saul was returned from following the philistines , that it was told him , saying , behold , david is in the wilderness of en - gedi .
then saul took three thousand chosen men out of all israel , and went to seek david and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats .
and he came to the sheepcotes by the way , where was a cave ; and saul went in to cover his feet : and david and his men remained in the sides of the cave .
and it came to pass , when the congregation was gathered against moses and against aaron , that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation : and , behold , the cloud covered it , and the glory of the lord appeared .
but on the morrow all the congregation of the children of israel murmured against moses and against aaron , saying , ye have killed the people of the lord .
and it came to pass afterward , that david ' s heart smote him , because he had cut off saul ' s skirt .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
and he said unto his men , the lord forbid that i should do this thing unto my master , the lord ' s anointed , to stretch forth mine hand against him , seeing he is the anointed of the lord .
and moses and aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation .
so david stayed his servants with these words , and suffered them not to rise against saul . but saul rose up out of the cave , and went on his way .
and moses said unto aaron , take a censer , and put fire therein from off the altar , and put on incense , and go quickly unto the congregation , and make an atonement for them : for there is wrath gone out from the lord ; the plague is begun .
david also arose afterward , and went out of the cave , and cried after saul , saying , my lord the king . and when saul looked behind him , david stooped with his face to the earth , and bowed himself .
get you up from among this congregation , that i may consume them as in a moment . and they fell upon their faces .
o zion , that bringest good tidings , get thee up into the high mountain ; o jerusalem , that bringest good tidings , lift up thy voice with strength ; lift it up , be not afraid ; say unto the cities of judah , behold your god !
the grass withereth , the flower fadeth : because the spirit of the lord bloweth upon it : surely the people is grass .
the grass withereth , the flower fadeth : but the word of our god shall stand for ever .
and eleazar the priest took the brasen censers , wherewith they that were burnt had offered ; and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altar :
the censers of these sinners against their own souls , let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar : for they offered them before the lord , therefore they are hallowed : and they shall be a sign unto the children of israel .
speak unto eleazar the son of aaron the priest , that he take up the censers out of the burning , and scatter thou the fire yonder ; for they are hallowed .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
and there came out a fire from the lord , and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense .
comfort ye , comfort ye my people , saith your god .
and all israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them : for they said , lest the earth swallow us up also .
speak ye comfortably to jerusalem , and cry unto her , that her warfare is accomplished , that her iniquity is pardoned : for she hath received of the lord ' s hand double for all her sins .
they , and all that appertained to them , went down alive into the pit , and the earth closed upon them : and they perished from among the congregation .
and the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed them up , and their houses , and all the men that appertained unto korah , and all their goods .
and it came to pass , as he had made an end of speaking all these words , that the ground clave asunder that was under them :
and the glory of the lord shall be revealed , and all flesh shall see it together : for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it .
but if the lord make a new thing , and the earth open her mouth , and swallow them up , with all that appertain unto them , and they go down quick into the pit ; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the lord .
the voice of him that crieth in the wilderness , prepare ye the way of the lord , make straight in the desert a highway for our god .
every valley shall be exalted , and every mountain and hill shall be made low : and the crooked shall be made straight , and the rough places plain :
and the word of the lord came unto me , saying ,
he cropped off the top of his young twigs , and carried it into a land of traffick ; he set it in a city of merchants .
he took also of the seed of the land , and planted it in a fruitful field ; he placed it by great waters , and set it as a willow tree .
son of man , put forth a riddle , and speak a parable unto the house of israel ;
and say , thus saith the lord god ; a great eagle with great wings , longwinged , full of feathers , which had divers colours , came unto lebanon , and took the highest branch of the cedar :
it was planted in a good soil by great waters , that it might bring forth branches , and that it might bear fruit , that it might be a goodly vine .
but tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him : therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy , and utterly to make away many .
say thou , thus saith the lord god ; shall it prosper ? shall he not pull up the roots thereof , and cut off the fruit thereof , that it wither ? it shall wither in all the leaves of her spring , even without great power or many people to pluck it up by the roots thereof .
but he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver , and over all the precious things of egypt : and the libyans and the ethiopians shall be at his steps .
and he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain ; yet he shall come to his end , and none shall help him .
and at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him : and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind , with chariots , and with horsemen , and with many ships ; and he shall enter into the countries , and shall overflow and pass over .
he shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries : and the land of egypt shall not escape .
he shall enter also into the glorious land , and many countries shall be overthrown : but these shall escape out of his hand , even edom , and moab , and the chief of the children of ammon .
if these men die the common death of all men , or if they be visited after the visitation of all men ; then the lord hath not sent me .
and he spake unto the congregation , saying , depart , i pray you , from the tents of these wicked men , and touch nothing of theirs , lest ye be consumed in all their sins .
and moses rose up and went unto dathan and abiram ; and the elders of israel followed him .
and moses said , hereby ye shall know that the lord hath sent me to do all these works ; for i have not done them of mine own mind .
so they gat up from the tabernacle of korah , dathan , and abiram , on every side : and dathan and abiram came out , and stood in the door of their tents , and their wives , and their sons , and their little children .
and they fell upon their faces , and said , o god , the god of the spirits of all flesh , shall one man sin , and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation ?
separate yourselves from among this congregation , that i may consume them in a moment .
speak unto the congregation , saying , get you up from about the tabernacle of korah , dathan , and abiram .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron , saying ,
and all the men were about twelve .
and when paul had laid his hands upon them , the holy ghost came on them ; and they spake with tongues , and prophesied .
but when divers were hardened , and believed not , but spake evil of that way before the multitude , he departed from them , and separated the disciples , disputing daily in the school of one tyrannus .
and he went into the synagogue , and spake boldly for the space of three months , disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of god .
wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto god by him , seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them .
but this man , because he continueth ever , hath an unchangeable priesthood .
and they truly were many priests , because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death :
and it came to pass , that , while apollos was at corinth , paul having passed through the upper coasts came to ephesus : and finding certain disciples ,
by so much was jesus made a surety of a better testament .
( for those priests were made without an oath ; but this with an oath by him that said unto him , the lord sware and will not repent , thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec : )
and he said unto them , unto what then were ye baptized ? and they said , unto john ' s baptism .
and inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest :
he said unto them , have ye received the holy ghost since ye believed ? and they said unto him , we have not so much as heard whether there be any holy ghost .
when they heard this , they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus .
then said paul , john verily baptized with the baptism of repentance , saying unto the people , that they should believe on him which should come after him , that is , on christ jesus .
for the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity ; but the word of the oath , which was since the law , maketh the son , who is consecrated for evermore .
for such an high priest became us , who is holy , harmless , undefiled , separate from sinners , and made higher than the heavens ;
who needeth not daily , as those high priests , to offer up sacrifice , first for his own sins , and then for the people ' s : for this he did once , when he offered up himself .
your kerchiefs also will i tear , and deliver my people out of your hand , and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted ; and ye shall know that i am the lord .
wherefore thus saith the lord god ; behold , i am against your pillows , wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make them fly , and i will tear them from your arms , and will let the souls go , even the souls that ye hunt to make them fly .
therefore ye shall see no more vanity , nor divine divinations : for i will deliver my people out of your hand : and ye shall know that i am the lord .
because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad , whom i have not made sad ; and strengthened the hands of the wicked , that he should not return from his wicked way , by promising him life :
lo , when the wall is fallen , shall it not be said unto you , where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it ?
say unto them which daub it with untempered morter , that it shall fall : there shall be an overflowing shower ; and ye , o great hailstones , shall fall ; and a stormy wind shall rend it .
because , even because they have seduced my people , saying , peace ; and there was no peace ; and one built up a wall , and , lo , others daubed it with untempered morter :
to wit , the prophets of israel which prophesy concerning jerusalem , and which see visions of peace for her , and there is no peace , saith the lord god .
thus will i accomplish my wrath upon the wall , and upon them that have daubed it with untempered morter , and will say unto you , the wall is no more , neither they that daubed it ;
so will i break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered morter , and bring it down to the ground , so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered , and it shall fall , and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof : and ye shall know that i am the lord .
therefore thus saith the lord god ; i will even rend it with a stormy wind in my fury ; and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger , and great hailstones in my fury to consume it .
and will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread , to slay the souls that should not die , and to save the souls alive that should not live , by your lying to my people that hear your lies ?
and say , thus saith the lord god ; woe to the women that sew pillows to all armholes , and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature to hunt souls ! will ye hunt the souls of my people , and will ye save the souls alive that come unto you ?
likewise , thou son of man , set thy face against the daughters of thy people , which prophesy out of their own heart ; and prophesy thou against them ,
for he was yet in the loins of his father , when melchisedec met him .
for the priesthood being changed , there is made of necessity a change also of the law .
if therefore perfection were by the levitical priesthood , ( for under it the people received the law , ) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of melchisedec , and not be called after the order of aaron ?
for it is evident that our lord sprang out of juda ; of which tribe moses spake nothing concerning priesthood .
for he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe , of which no man gave attendance at the altar .
and it is yet far more evident : for that after the similitude of melchisedec there ariseth another priest ,
who is made , not after the law of a carnal commandment , but after the power of an endless life .
for he testifieth , thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec .
for there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof .
for the law made nothing perfect , but the bringing in of a better hope did ; by the which we draw nigh unto god .
being confident of this very thing , that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ :
for god is my record , how greatly i long after you all in the bowels of jesus christ .
and this i pray , that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment ;
i thank my god upon every remembrance of you ,
so david and his men went to keilah , and fought with the philistines , and brought away their cattle , and smote them with a great slaughter . so david saved the inhabitants of keilah .
grace be unto you , and peace , from god our father , and from the lord jesus christ .
then david inquired of the lord yet again . and the lord answered him and said , arise , go down to keilah ; for i will deliver the philistines into thine hand .
and david ' s men said unto him , behold , we be afraid here in judah : how much more then if we come to keilah against the armies of the philistines ?
always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy ,
and david knew that saul secretly practised mischief against him ; and he said to abiathar the priest , bring hither the ephod .
and saul called all the people together to war , to go down to keilah , to besiege david and his men .
paul and timotheus , the servants of jesus christ , to all the saints in christ jesus which are at philippi , with the bishops and deacons :
and it was told saul that david was come to keilah . and saul said , god hath delivered him into mine hand ; for he is shut in , by entering into a town that hath gates and bars .
and it came to pass , when abiathar the son of ahimelech fled to david to keilah , that he came down with an ephod in his hand .
then they told david , saying , behold , the philistines fight against keilah , and they rob the threshingfloors .
many are the afflictions of the righteous : but the lord delivereth him out of them all .
the lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart ; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit .
keep thy tongue from evil , and thy lips from speaking guile .
what man is he that desireth life , and loveth many days , that he may see good ?
come , ye children , hearken unto me : i will teach you the fear of the lord .
the young lions do lack , and suffer hunger : but they that seek the lord shall not want any good thing .
the righteous cry , and the lord heareth , and delivereth them out of all their troubles .
the face of the lord is against them that do evil , to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth .
the eyes of the lord are upon the righteous , and his ears are open unto their cry .
depart from evil , and do good ; seek peace , and pursue it .
and they waited for me as for the rain ; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain .
after my words they spake not again ; and my speech dropped upon them .
unto me men gave ear , and waited , and kept silence at my counsel .
my glory was fresh in me , and my bow was renewed in my hand .
and in every province , and in every city , whithersoever the king ' s commandment and his decree came , the jews had joy and gladness , a feast and a good day . and many of the people of the land became jews ; for the fear of the jews fell upon them .
i chose out their way , and sat chief , and dwelt as a king in the army , as one that comforteth the mourners .
if i laughed on them , they believed it not ; and the light of my countenance they cast not down .
so the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out , being hastened and pressed on by the king ' s commandment . and the decree was given at shushan the palace .
the copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people , and that the jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies .
the jews had light , and gladness , and joy , and honour .
and mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white , and with a great crown of gold , and with a garment of fine linen and purple : and the city of shushan rejoiced and was glad .
and he wrote in the king ahasuerus ' name , and sealed it with the king ' s ring , and sent letters by posts on horseback , and riders on mules , camels , and young dromedaries :
the nobles held their peace , and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth .
because i delivered the poor that cried , and the fatherless , and him that had none to help him .
when the ear heard me , then it blessed me ; and when the eye saw me , it gave witness to me :
i put on righteousness , and it clothed me : my judgment was as a robe and a diadem .
i was a father to the poor : and the cause which i knew not i searched out .
i was eyes to the blind , and feet was i to the lame .
then i said , i shall die in my nest , and i shall multiply my days as the sand .
my root was spread out by the waters , and the dew lay all night upon my branch .
and all that sat in the council , looking stedfastly on him , saw his face as it had been the face of an angel .
and set up false witnesses , which said , this man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place , and the law :
for we have heard him say , that this jesus of nazareth shall destroy this place , and shall change the customs which moses delivered us .
then they suborned men , which said , we have heard him speak blasphemous words against moses , and against god .
many a time have they afflicted me from my youth , may israel now say :
and they stirred up the people , and the elders , and the scribes , and came upon him , and caught him , and brought him to the council ,
and judah gathered themselves together , to ask help of the lord : even out of all the cities of judah they came to seek the lord .
and jehoshaphat feared , and set himself to seek the lord , and proclaimed a fast throughout all judah .
then there came some that told jehoshaphat , saying , there cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side syria ; and , behold , they be hazazon - tamar , which is en - gedi .
it came to pass after this also , that the children of moab , and the children of ammon , and with them other beside the ammonites , came against jehoshaphat to battle .
if , when evil cometh upon us , as the sword , judgment , or pestilence , or famine , we stand before this house , and in thy presence , ( for thy name is in this house , ) and cry unto thee in our affliction , then thou wilt hear and help .
and they dwelt therein , and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name , saying ,
art not thou our god , who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people israel , and gavest it to the seed of abraham thy friend for ever ?
and said , o lord god of our fathers , art not thou god in heaven ? and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen ? and in thine hand is there not power and might , so that none is able to withstand thee ?
and jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of judah and jerusalem , in the house of the lord , before the new court ,
the lord is righteous : he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked .
let them all be confounded and turned back that hate zion .
and they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake .
many a time have they afflicted me from my youth : yet they have not prevailed against me .
neither do they which go by say , the blessing of the lord be upon you : we bless you in the name of the lord .
let them be as the grass upon the housetops , which withereth afore it groweth up :
wherewith the mower filleth not his hand ; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom .
command aaron and his sons , saying , this is the law of the burnt offering : it is the burnt offering , because of the burning upon the altar all night unto the morning , and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it .
or all that about which he hath sworn falsely ; he shall even restore it in the principal , and shall add the fifth part more thereto , and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth , in the day of his trespass offering .
and he shall bring his trespass offering unto the lord , a ram without blemish out of the flock , with thy estimation , for a trespass offering , unto the priest :
and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the lord : and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that he hath done in trespassing therein .
evil shall slay the wicked : and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
the lord redeemeth the soul of his servants : and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
command the children of israel , and say unto them , when ye come into the land of canaan ; ( this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance , even the land of canaan with the coasts thereof : )
and your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of akrabbim , and pass on to zin : and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to kadesh - barnea , and shall go on to hazar - addar , and pass on to azmon :
and the border shall fetch a compass from azmon unto the river of egypt , and the goings out of it shall be at the sea .
and as for the western border , ye shall even have the great sea for a border : this shall be your west border .
and this shall be your north border : from the great sea ye shall point out for you mount hor :
from mount hor ye shall point out your border unto the entrance of hamath ; and the goings forth of the border shall be to zedad :
oh that the salvation of israel were come out of zion ! when the lord bringeth back the captivity of his people , jacob shall rejoice , and israel shall be glad .
the fool hath said in his heart , there is no god . they are corrupt , they have done abominable works , there is none that doeth good .
he keepeth all his bones : not one of them is broken .
the lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men , to see if there were any that did understand , and seek god .
there were they in great fear : for god is in the generation of the righteous .
ye have shamed the counsel of the poor , because the lord is his refuge .
they are all gone aside , they are all together become filthy : there is none that doeth good , no , not one .
in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the lord :
in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of god through the spirit .
and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets , jesus christ himself being the chief corner stone ;
that thy beloved may be delivered : save with thy right hand , and answer me .
be thou exalted , o god , above the heavens : and thy glory above all the earth ;
gilead is mine ; manasseh is mine ; ephraim also is the strength of mine head ; judah is my lawgiver ;
god hath spoken in his holiness ; i will rejoice , i will divide shechem , and mete out the valley of succoth .
or have found that which was lost , and lieth concerning it , and sweareth falsely ; in any of all these that a man doeth , sinning therein :
awake , psaltery and harp : i myself will awake early .
then it shall be , because he hath sinned , and is guilty , that he shall restore that which he took violently away , or the thing which he hath deceitfully gotten , or that which was delivered him to keep , or the lost thing which he found ,
o god , my heart is fixed ; i will sing and give praise , even with my glory .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
for thy mercy is great above the heavens : and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds .
if a soul sin , and commit a trespass against the lord , and lie unto his neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep , or in fellowship , or in a thing taken away by violence , or hath deceived his neighbour ;
now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners , but fellowcitizens with the saints , and of the household of god ;
for through him we both have access by one spirit unto the father .
moab is my washpot ; over edom will i cast out my shoe ; over philistia will i triumph .
and the border shall go on to ziphron , and the goings out of it shall be at hazar - enan : this shall be your north border .
that at that time ye were without christ , being aliens from the commonwealth of israel , and strangers from the covenants of promise , having no hope , and without god in the world :
but now in christ jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of christ .
for we are his workmanship , created in christ jesus unto good works , which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them .
wherefore remember , that ye being in time past gentiles in the flesh , who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands ;
and that he might reconcile both unto god in one body by the cross , having slain the enmity thereby :
and came and preached peace to you which were afar off , and to them that were nigh .
for he is our peace , who hath made both one , and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us ;
having abolished in his flesh the enmity , even the law of commandments contained in ordinances ; for to make in himself of twain one new man , so making peace ;
to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne , even as i also overcame , and am set down with my father in his throne .
he that hath an ear , let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches .
so then because thou art lukewarm , and neither cold nor hot , i will spue thee out of my mouth .
i know thy works , that thou art neither cold nor hot : i would thou wert cold or hot .
and unto the angel of the church of the laodiceans write ; these things saith the amen , the faithful and true witness , the beginning of the creation of god ;
he that hath an ear , let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches .
because thou hast kept the word of my patience , i also will keep thee from the hour of temptation , which shall come upon all the world , to try them that dwell upon the earth .
as many as i love , i rebuke and chasten : be zealous therefore , and repent .
i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire , that thou mayest be rich ; and white raiment , that thou mayest be clothed , and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear ; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve , that thou mayest see .
because thou sayest , i am rich , and increased with goods , and have need of nothing ; and knowest not that thou art wretched , and miserable , and poor , and blind , and naked :
for as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law : and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law ;
will he make many supplications unto thee ? will he speak soft words unto thee ?
for there is no respect of persons with god .
canst thou put an hook into his nose ? or bore his jaw through with a thorn ?
but glory , honour , and peace , to every man that worketh good , to the jew first , and also to the gentile :
canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook ? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down ?
and art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind , a light of them which are in darkness ,
and knowest his will , and approvest the things that are more excellent , being instructed out of the law ;
behold , thou art called a jew , and restest in the law , and makest thy boast of god ,
in the day when god shall judge the secrets of men by jesus christ according to my gospel .
which shew the work of the law written in their hearts , their conscience also bearing witness , and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another ; )
for when the gentiles , which have not the law , do by nature the things contained in the law , these , having not the law , are a law unto themselves :
( for not the hearers of the law are just before god , but the doers of the law shall be justified .
they are inclosed in their own fat : with their mouth they speak proudly .
arise , o lord , disappoint him , cast him down : deliver my soul from the wicked , which is thy sword :
from men which are thy hand , o lord , from men of the world , which have their portion in this life , and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure : they are full of children , and leave the rest of their substance to their babes .
they have now compassed us in our steps : they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth ;
like as a lion that is greedy of his prey , and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places .
and they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half , and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves .
and their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city , which spiritually is called sodom and egypt , where also our lord was crucified .
and when they shall have finished their testimony , the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them , and shall overcome them , and kill them .
will he make a covenant with thee ? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever ?
wilt thou play with him as with a bird ? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens ?
shall the companions make a banquet of him ? shall they part him among the merchants ?
canst thou fill his skin with barbed iron ? or his head with fish spears ?
lay thine hand upon him , remember the battle , do no more .
behold , the hope of him is in vain : shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him ?
thou shalt also consider in thine heart , that , as a man chasteneth his son , so the lord thy god chasteneth thee .
thy raiment waxed not old upon thee , neither did thy foot swell , these forty years .
for the lord thy god bringeth thee into a good land , a land of brooks of water , of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills ;
therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the lord thy god , to walk in his ways , and to fear him .
a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness , thou shalt not lack any thing in it ; a land whose stones are iron , and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass .
a land of wheat , and barley , and vines , and fig trees , and pomegranates ; a land of oil olive , and honey ;
the lord of hosts is with us ; the god of jacob is our refuge . selah .
all the commandments which i command thee this day shall ye observe to do , that ye may live , and multiply , and go in and possess the land which the lord sware unto your fathers .
and he humbled thee , and suffered thee to hunger , and fed thee with manna , which thou knewest not , neither did thy fathers know ; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only , but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the lord doth man live .
and thou shalt remember all the way which the lord thy god led thee these forty years in the wilderness , to humble thee , and to prove thee , to know what was in thine heart , whether thou wouldest keep his commandments , or no .
be still , and know that i am god : i will be exalted among the heathen , i will be exalted in the earth .
the king of shimron - meron , one ; the king of achshaph , one ;
but the court which is without the temple leave out , and measure it not ; for it is given unto the gentiles : and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months .
and there was given me a reed like unto a rod : and the angel stood , saying , rise , and measure the temple of god , and the altar , and them that worship therein .
these are the two olive trees , and the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth .
and i will give power unto my two witnesses , and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days , clothed in sackcloth .
these have power to shut heaven , that it rain not in the days of their prophecy : and have power over waters to turn them to blood , and to smite the earth with all plagues , as often as they will .
and if any man will hurt them , fire proceedeth out of their mouth , and devoureth their enemies : and if any man will hurt them , he must in this manner be killed .
the king of makkedah , one ; the king of bethel , one ;
the king of tappuah , one ; the king of hepher , one ;
the king of hormah , one ; the king of arad , one ;
the king of libnah , one ; the king of adullam , one ;
the king of eglon , one ; the king of gezer , one ;
the king of debir , one ; the king of geder , one ;
the king of jerusalem , one ; the king of hebron , one ;
then david said , this is the house of the lord god , and this is the altar of the burnt offering for israel .
and david commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of israel ; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of god .
and david prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates , and for the joinings ; and brass in abundance without weight ;
also cedar trees in abundance : for the zidonians and they of tyre brought much cedar wood to david .
and david said , solomon my son is young and tender , and the house that is to be builded for the lord must be exceeding magnifical , of fame and of glory throughout all countries : i will therefore now make preparation for it . so david prepared abundantly before his death .
and shall cut him asunder , and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
then he called for solomon his son , and charged him to build an house for the lord god of israel .
and david said to solomon , my son , as for me , it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the lord my god :
but the word of the lord came to me , saying , thou hast shed blood abundantly , and hast made great wars : thou shalt not build an house unto my name , because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight .
the king of aphek , one ; the king of lasharon , one ;
behold , a son shall be born to thee , who shall be a man of rest ; and i will give him rest from all his enemies round about : for his name shall be solomon , and i will give peace and quietness unto israel in his days .
the king of madon , one ; the king of hazor , one ;
in his days the edomites revolted from under the dominion of judah , and made themselves a king .
then jehoram went forth with his princes , and all his chariots with him : and he rose up by night , and smote the edomites which compassed him in , and the captains of the chariots .
jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign , and he reigned eight years in jerusalem .
and he walked in the way of the kings of israel , like as did the house of ahab : for he had the daughter of ahab to wife : and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the lord .
howbeit the lord would not destroy the house of david , because of the covenant that he had made with david , and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever .
now jehoshaphat slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of david . and jehoram his son reigned in his stead .
and he had brethren the sons of jehoshaphat , azariah , and jehiel , and zechariah , and azariah , and michael , and shephatiah : all these were the sons of jehoshaphat king of israel .
and their father gave them great gifts of silver , and of gold , and of precious things , with fenced cities in judah : but the kingdom gave he to jehoram ; because he was the firstborn .
the king of taanach , one ; the king of megiddo , one ;
the king of kedesh , one ; the king of jokneam of carmel , one ;
the king of tirzah , one : all the kings thirty and one .
and ye know that with all my power i have served your father .
and your father hath deceived me , and changed my wages ten times ; but god suffered him not to hurt me .
and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven : and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn , and they shall see the son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory .
if he said thus , the speckled shall be thy wages ; then all the cattle bare speckled : and if he said thus , the ringstraked shall be thy hire ; then bare all the cattle ringstraked .
thus god hath taken away the cattle of your father , and given them to me .
and the sabeans fell upon them , and took them away ; yea , they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword ; and i only am escaped alone to tell thee .
and there came a messenger unto job , and said , the oxen were plowing , and the asses feeding beside them :
and there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother ' s house :
and knew not until the flood came , and took them all away ; so shall also the coming of the son of man be .
and the lord said unto satan , behold , all that he hath is in thy power ; only upon himself put not forth thine hand . so satan went forth from the presence of the lord .
but put forth thine hand now , and touch all that he hath , and he will curse thee to thy face .
hast not thou made an hedge about him , and about his house , and about all that he hath on every side ? thou hast blessed the work of his hands , and his substance is increased in the land .
and the lord said unto jacob , return unto the land of thy fathers , and to thy kindred ; and i will be with thee .
verily i say unto you , this generation shall not pass , till all these things be fulfilled .
and jacob beheld the countenance of laban , and , behold , it was not toward him as before .
so likewise ye , when ye shall see all these things , know that it is near , even at the doors .
and said unto them , i see your father ' s countenance , that it is not toward me as before ; but the god of my father hath been with me .
now learn a parable of the fig tree ; when his branch is yet tender , and putteth forth leaves , ye know that summer is nigh :
and jacob sent and called rachel and leah to the field unto his flock ,
and he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet , and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds , from one end of heaven to the other .
for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the day that noe entered into the ark ,
but as the days of noe were , so shall also the coming of the son of man be .
and he heard the words of laban ' s sons , saying , jacob hath taken away all that was our father ' s ; and of that which was our father ' s hath he gotten all this glory .
but of that day and hour knoweth no man , no , not the angels of heaven , but my father only .
heaven and earth shall pass away , but my words shall not pass away .
till we all come in the unity of the faith , and of the knowledge of the son of god , unto a perfect man , unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of christ :
for the perfecting of the saints , for the work of the ministry , for the edifying of the body of christ :
but speaking the truth in love , may grow up into him in all things , which is the head , even christ :
that we henceforth be no more children , tossed to and fro , and carried about with every wind of doctrine , by the sleight of men , and cunning craftiness , whereby they lie in wait to deceive ;
and the sons of the prophets said unto elisha , behold now , the place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us .
from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth , according to the effectual working in the measure of every part , maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love .
who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness , to work all uncleanness with greediness .
then shall two be in the field ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
having the understanding darkened , being alienated from the life of god through the ignorance that is in them , because of the blindness of their heart :
two women shall be grinding at the mill ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
and he gave some , apostles ; and some , prophets ; and some , evangelists ; and some , pastors and teachers ;
in whom we have redemption through his blood , the forgiveness of sins , according to the riches of his grace ;
to the praise of the glory of his grace , wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved .
wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence ;
blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ , who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ :
grace be to you , and peace , from god our father , and from the lord jesus christ .
having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself , according to the good pleasure of his will ,
according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world , that we should be holy and without blame before him in love :
therefore said he , take it up to thee . and he put out his hand , and took it .
but know this , that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come , he would have watched , and would not have suffered his house to be broken up .
and the man of god said , where fell it ? and he shewed him the place . and he cut down a stick , and cast it in thither ; and the iron did swim .
watch therefore : for ye know not what hour your lord doth come .
paul , an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god , to the saints which are at ephesus , and to the faithful in christ jesus :
who then is a faithful and wise servant , whom his lord hath made ruler over his household , to give them meat in due season ?
then the king of syria warred against israel , and took counsel with his servants , saying , in such and such a place shall be my camp .
therefore be ye also ready : for in such an hour as ye think not the son of man cometh .
and one said , be content , i pray thee , and go with thy servants . and he answered , i will go .
verily i say unto you , that he shall make him ruler over all his goods .
let us go , we pray thee , unto jordan , and take thence every man a beam , and let us make us a place there , where we may dwell . and he answered , go ye .
blessed is that servant , whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing .
but as one was felling a beam , the axe head fell into the water : and he cried , and said , alas , master ! for it was borrowed .
and shall begin to smite his fellowservants , and to eat and drink with the drunken ;
so he went with them . and when they came to jordan , they cut down wood .
but and if that evil servant shall say in his heart , my lord delayeth his coming ;
and i will cut off the chariot from ephraim , and the horse from jerusalem , and the battle bow shall be cut off : and he shall speak peace unto the heathen : and his dominion shall be from sea even to sea , and from river even to the ends of the earth .
and when the king ' s decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire , ( for it is great , ) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour , both to great and small .
as for thee also , by the blood of thy covenant i have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water .
and they were to prove israel by them , to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the lord , which he commanded their fathers by the hand of moses .
and the lord shall be seen over them , and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning : and the lord god shall blow the trumpet , and shall go with whirlwinds of the south .
the lord of hosts shall defend them ; and they shall devour , and subdue with sling stones ; and they shall drink , and make a noise as through wine ; and they shall be filled like bowls , and as the corners of the altar .
and they took their daughters to be their wives , and gave their daughters to their sons , and served their gods .
turn you to the strong hold , ye prisoners of hope : even to day do i declare that i will render double unto thee ;
and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord , and forgat the lord their god , and served baalim and the groves .
when i have bent judah for me , filled the bow with ephraim , and raised up thy sons , o zion , against thy sons , o greece , and made thee as the sword of a mighty man .
now these are the nations which the lord left , to prove israel by them , even as many of israel as had not known all the wars of canaan ;
only that the generations of the children of israel might know , to teach them war , at the least such as before knew nothing thereof ;
for how great is his goodness , and how great is his beauty ! corn shall make the young men cheerful , and new wine the maids .
and when the children of israel cried unto the lord , the lord raised up a deliverer to the children of israel , who delivered them , even othniel the son of kenaz , caleb ' s younger brother .
therefore the anger of the lord was hot against israel , and he sold them into the hand of chushan - rishathaim king of mesopotamia : and the children of israel served chushan - rishathaim eight years .
and woe unto them that are with child , and to them that give suck in those days !
neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes .
let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house :
then let them which be in judaea flee into the mountains :
when ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation , spoken of by daniel the prophet , stand in the holy place , ( whoso readeth , let him understand : )
for he sent letters into all the king ' s provinces , into every province according to the writing thereof , and to every people after their language , that every man should bear rule in his own house , and that it should be published according to the language of every people .
and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations ; and then shall the end come .
and the saying pleased the king and the princes ; and the king did according to the word of memucan :
but he that shall endure unto the end , the same shall be saved .
and because iniquity shall abound , the love of many shall wax cold .
and many false prophets shall rise , and shall deceive many .
and then shall many be offended , and shall betray one another , and shall hate one another .
for the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of jordan , until everything was finished that the lord commanded joshua to speak unto the people , according to all that moses commanded joshua : and the people hasted and passed over .
and it came to pass , when all the people were clean passed over , that the ark of the lord passed over , and the priests , in the presence of the people .
and the children of reuben , and the children of gad , and half the tribe of manasseh , passed over armed before the children of israel , as moses spake unto them :
about forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the lord unto battle , to the plains of jericho .
while he was yet speaking , there came also another , and said , the chaldeans made out three bands , and fell upon the camels , and have carried them away , yea , and slain the servants with the edge of the sword ; and i only am escaped alone to tell thee .
on that day the lord magnified joshua in the sight of all israel ; and they feared him , as they feared moses , all the days of his life .
while he was yet speaking , there came also another , and said , thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother ' s house :
and the lord spake unto joshua , saying ,
and , behold , there came a great wind from the wilderness , and smote the four corners of the house , and it fell upon the young men , and they are dead ; and i only am escaped alone to tell thee .
command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony , that they come up out of jordan .
joshua therefore commanded the priests , saying , come ye up out of jordan .
and the people came up out of jordan on the tenth day of the first month , and encamped in gilgal , in the east border of jericho .
and said , naked came i out of my mother ' s womb , and naked shall i return thither : the lord gave , and the lord hath taken away ; blessed be the name of the lord .
likewise shall the ladies of persia and media say this day unto all the king ' s princes , which have heard of the deed of the queen . thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath .
then job arose , and rent his mantle , and shaved his head , and fell down upon the ground , and worshipped ,
in all this job sinned not , nor charged god foolishly .
immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened , and the moon shall not give her light , and the stars shall fall from heaven , and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken :
for wheresoever the carcase is , there will the eagles be gathered together .
to bring vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal , to shew the people and the princes her beauty : for she was fair to look on .
behold , i have told you before .
on the seventh day , when the heart of the king was merry with wine , he commanded mehuman , biztha , harbona , bigtha , and abagtha , zethar , and carcas , the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of ahasuerus the king ,
for there shall arise false christs , and false prophets , and shall shew great signs and wonders ; insomuch that , if it were possible , they shall deceive the very elect .
then the king said to the wise men , which knew the times , ( for so was the king ' s manner toward all that knew law and judgment :
for as the lightning cometh out of the east , and shineth even unto the west ; so shall also the coming of the son of man be .
but the queen vashti refused to come at the king ' s commandment by his chamberlains : therefore was the king very wroth , and his anger burned in him .
wherefore if they shall say unto you , behold , he is in the desert ; go not forth : behold , he is in the secret chambers ; believe it not .
what shall we do unto the queen vashti according to law , because she hath not performed the commandment of the king ahasuerus by the chamberlains ?
for then shall be great tribulation , such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time , no , nor ever shall be .
and the next unto him was carshena , shethar , admatha , tarshish , meres , marsena , and memucan , the seven princes of persia and media , which saw the king ' s face , and which sat the first in the kingdom ; )
but pray ye that your flight be not in the winter , neither on the sabbath day :
for this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women , so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes , when it shall be reported , the king ahasuerus commanded vashti the queen to be brought in before him , but she came not .
then if any man shall say unto you , lo , here is christ , or there ; believe it not .
and memucan answered before the king and the princes , vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only , but also to all the princes , and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king ahasuerus .
and except those days should be shortened , there should no flesh be saved : but for the elect ' s sake those days shall be shortened .
that all the people of the earth might know the hand of the lord , that it is mighty : that ye might fear the lord your god for ever .
for the lord your god dried up the waters of jordan from before you , until ye were passed over , as the lord your god did to the red sea , which he dried up from before us , until we were gone over :
then ye shall let your children know , saying , israel came over this jordan on dry land .
and he spake unto the children of israel , saying , when your children shall ask their fathers in time to come , saying , what mean these stones ?
and those twelve stones , which they took out of jordan , did joshua pitch in gilgal .
then herod , when he had privily called the wise men , inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared .
and thou bethlehem , in the land of juda , art not the least among the princes of juda : for out of thee shall come a governor , that shall rule my people israel .
when they had heard the king , they departed ; and , lo , the star , which they saw in the east , went before them , till it came and stood over where the young child was .
and he sent them to bethlehem , and said , go and search diligently for the young child ; and when ye have found him , bring me word again , that i may come and worship him also .
both low and high , rich and poor , together .
hear this , all ye people ; give ear , all ye inhabitants of the world :
i will incline mine ear to a parable : i will open my dark saying upon the harp .
my mouth shall speak of wisdom ; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding .
that he should still live for ever , and not see corruption .
they that trust in their wealth , and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches ;
wherefore should i fear in the days of evil , when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about ?
( for the redemption of their soul is precious , and it ceaseth for ever : )
none of them can by any means redeem his brother , nor give to god a ransom for him :
if so be that ye have heard him , and have been taught by him , as the truth is in jesus :
that ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man , which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts ;
but ye have not so learned christ ;
let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth , but that which is good to the use of edifying , that it may minister grace unto the hearers .
neither give place to the devil .
let him that stole steal no more : but rather let him labour , working with his hands the thing which is good , that he may have to give to him that needeth .
wherefore putting away lying , speak every man truth with his neighbour : for we are members one of another .
be ye angry , and sin not : let not the sun go down upon your wrath :
and be renewed in the spirit of your mind ;
and that ye put on the new man , which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness .
and grieve not the holy spirit of god , whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption .
therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law , shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision ?
let all bitterness , and wrath , and anger , and clamour , and evil speaking , be put away from you , with all malice :
and shall not uncircumcision which is by nature , if it fulfil the law , judge thee , who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law ?
now when jesus was born in bethlehem of judaea in the days of herod the king , behold , there came wise men from the east to jerusalem ,
and be ye kind one to another , tenderhearted , forgiving one another , even as god for christ ' s sake hath forgiven you .
for circumcision verily profiteth , if thou keep the law : but if thou be a breaker of the law , thy circumcision is made uncircumcision .
and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together , he demanded of them where christ should be born .
and they said unto him , in bethlehem of judaea : for thus it is written by the prophet ,
saying , where is he that is born king of the jews ? for we have seen his star in the east , and are come to worship him .
but he is a jew , which is one inwardly ; and circumcision is that of the heart , in the spirit , and not in the letter ; whose praise is not of men , but of god .
when herod the king had heard these things , he was troubled , and all jerusalem with him .
thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery , dost thou commit adultery ? thou that abhorrest idols , dost thou commit sacrilege ?
thou that makest thy boast of the law , through breaking the law dishonourest thou god ?
an instructor of the foolish , a teacher of babes , which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law .
and began to salute him , hail , king of the jews !
and they clothed him with purple , and platted a crown of thorns , and put it about his head ,
and they smote him on the head with a reed , and did spit upon him , and bowing their knees worshipped him .
then pilate said unto them , why , what evil hath he done ? and they cried out the more exceedingly , crucify him .
and they cried out again , crucify him .
and the soldiers led him away into the hall , called praetorium ; and they call together the whole band .
and so pilate , willing to content the people , released barabbas unto them , and delivered jesus , when he had scourged him , to be crucified .
o house of david , thus saith the lord ; execute judgment in the morning , and deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor , lest my fury go out like fire , and burn that none can quench it , because of the evil of your doings .
and touching the house of the king of judah , say , hear ye the word of the lord ;
but i will punish you according to the fruit of your doings , saith the lord : and i will kindle a fire in the forest thereof , and it shall devour all things round about it .
behold , i am against thee , o inhabitant of the valley , and rock of the plain , saith the lord ; which say , who shall come down against us ? or who shall enter into our habitations ?
for i have set my face against this city for evil , and not for good , saith the lord : it shall be given into the hand of the king of babylon , and he shall burn it with fire .
for he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy .
but the chief priests moved the people , that he should rather release barabbas unto them .
and pilate answered and said again unto them , what will ye then that i shall do unto him whom ye call the king of the jews ?
and the king communed with them ; and among them all was found none like daniel , hananiah , mishael , and azariah : therefore stood they before the king .
now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in , then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before nebuchadnezzar .
as for these four children , god gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom : and daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams .
thus melzar took away the portion of their meat , and the wine that they should drink ; and gave them pulse .
and at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king ' s meat .
so he consented to them in this matter , and proved them ten days .
then let our countenances be looked upon before thee , and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king ' s meat : and as thou seest , deal with thy servants .
prove thy servants , i beseech thee , ten days ; and let them give us pulse to eat , and water to drink .
then said daniel to melzar , whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over daniel , hananiah , mishael , and azariah ,
and the prince of the eunuchs said unto daniel , i fear my lord the king , who hath appointed your meat and your drink : for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort ? then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king .
and , behold , there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot , and subtil of heart .
( she is loud and stubborn ; her feet abide not in her house :
and saying , repent ye : for the kingdom of heaven is at hand .
now is she without , now in the streets , and lieth in wait at every corner . )
in those days came john the baptist , preaching in the wilderness of judaea ,
so she caught him , and kissed him , and with an impudent face said unto him ,
and the same john had his raiment of camel ' s hair , and a leathern girdle about his loins ; and his meat was locusts and wild honey .
i have peace offerings with me ; this day have i payed my vows .
for this is he that was spoken of by the prophet esaias , saying , the voice of one crying in the wilderness , prepare ye the way of the lord , make his paths straight .
therefore came i forth to meet thee , diligently to seek thy face , and i have found thee .
i have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry , with carved works , with fine linen of egypt .
i have perfumed my bed with myrrh , aloes , and cinnamon .
come , let us take our fill of love until the morning : let us solace ourselves with loves .
for the goodman is not at home , he is gone a long journey :
he hath taken a bag of money with him , and will come home at the day appointed .
with her much fair speech she caused him to yield , with the flattering of her lips she forced him .
hearken unto me now therefore , o ye children , and attend to the words of my mouth .
let not thine heart decline to her ways , go not astray in her paths .
he goeth after her straightway , as an ox goeth to the slaughter , or as a fool to the correction of the stocks ;
till a dart strike through his liver ; as a bird hasteth to the snare , and knoweth not that it is for his life .
for she hath cast down many wounded : yea , many strong men have been slain by her .
her house is the way to hell , going down to the chambers of death .
then answered doeg the edomite , which was set over the servants of saul , and said , i saw the son of jesse coming to nob , to ahimelech the son of ahitub .
then saul said unto his servants that stood about him , hear now , ye benjamites ; will the son of jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards , and make you all captains of thousands , and captains of hundreds ;
when saul heard that david was discovered , and the men that were with him , ( now saul abode in gibeah under a tree in ramah , having his spear in his hand , and all his servants were standing about him ; )
and the prophet gad said unto david , abide not in the hold ; depart , and get thee into the land of judah . then david departed , and came into the forest of hareth .
and he brought them before the king of moab : and they dwelt with him all the while that david was in the hold .
and david went thence to mizpeh of moab : and he said unto the king of moab , let my father and my mother , i pray thee , come forth , and be with you , till i know what god will do for me .
david therefore departed thence , and escaped to the cave adullam : and when his brethren and all his father ' s house heard it , they went down thither to him .
and every one that was in distress , and every one that was in debt , and every one that was discontented , gathered themselves unto him ; and he became a captain over them : and there were with him about four hundred men .
for he served baal , and worshipped him , and provoked to anger the lord god of israel , according to all that his father had done .
and he did evil in the sight of the lord , and walked in the way of his father , and in the way of his mother , and in the way of jeroboam the son of nebat , who made israel to sin :
and in all matters of wisdom and understanding , that the king inquired of them , he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm .
and daniel continued even unto the first year of king cyrus .
and the remnant of the sodomites , which remained in the days of his father asa , he took out of the land .
now the rest of the acts of jehoshaphat , and his might that he shewed , and how he warred , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah ?
jehoshaphat made ships of tharshish to go to ophir for gold : but they went not ; for the ships were broken at ezion - geber .
there was then no king in edom : a deputy was king .
jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty and five years in jerusalem . and his mother ' s name was azubah the daughter of shilhi .
and jehoshaphat the son of asa began to reign over judah in the fourth year of ahab king of israel .
and jehoshaphat made peace with the king of israel .
and he walked in all the ways of asa his father ; he turned not aside from it , doing that which was right in the eyes of the lord : nevertheless the high places were not taken away ; for the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places .
and jehoshaphat slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of david his father : and jehoram his son reigned in his stead .
ahaziah the son of ahab began to reign over israel in samaria the seventeenth year of jehoshaphat king of judah , and reigned two years over israel .
so ahab slept with his fathers ; and ahaziah his son reigned in his stead .
for thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands : happy shalt thou be , and it shall be well with thee .
blessed is every one that feareth the lord ; that walketh in his ways .
and one washed the chariot in the pool of samaria ; and the dogs licked up his blood ; and they washed his armour ; according unto the word of the lord which he spake .
now the rest of the acts of ahab , and all that he did , and the ivory house which he made , and all the cities that he built , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel ?
and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat , i will disguise myself , and enter into the battle ; but put thou on thy robes . and the king of israel disguised himself , and went into the battle .
but the king of syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots , saying , fight neither with small nor great , save only with the king of israel .
and it came to pass , when the captains of the chariots saw jehoshaphat , that they said , surely it is the king of israel . and they turned aside to fight against him : and jehoshaphat cried out .
and it came to pass , when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of israel , that they turned back from pursuing him .
and a certain man drew a bow at a venture , and smote the king of israel between the joints of the harness : wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot , turn thine hand , and carry me out of the host ; for i am wounded .
and the battle increased that day : and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the syrians , and died at even : and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot .
and there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun , saying , every man to his city , and every man to his own country .
so the king died , and was brought to samaria ; and they buried the king in samaria .
thy holy cities are a wilderness , zion is a wilderness , jerusalem a desolation .
our holy and our beautiful house , where our fathers praised thee , is burned up with fire : and all our pleasant things are laid waste .
wilt thou refrain thyself for these things , o lord ? wilt thou hold thy peace , and afflict us very sore ?
so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah went up to ramoth - gilead .
and it shall be , when he shall be guilty in one of these things , that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing :
or if a soul swear , pronouncing with his lips to do evil , or to do good , whatsoever it be that a man shall pronounce with an oath , and it be hid from him ; when he knoweth of it , then he shall be guilty in one of these .
or if he touch the uncleanness of man , whatsoever uncleanness it be that a man shall be defiled withal , and it be hid from him ; when he knoweth of it , then he shall be guilty .
and micaiah said , if thou return at all in peace , the lord hath not spoken by me . and he said , hearken , o people , every one of you .
or if a soul touch any unclean thing , whether it be a carcase of an unclean beast , or a carcase of unclean cattle , or the carcase of unclean creeping things , and if it be hidden from him ; he also shall be unclean , and guilty .
and if a soul sin , and hear the voice of swearing , and is a witness , whether he hath seen or known of it ; if he do not utter it , then he shall bear his iniquity .
the lord shall bless thee out of zion : and thou shalt see the good of jerusalem all the days of thy life .
yea , thou shalt see thy children ' s children , and peace upon israel .
thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house : thy children like olive plants round about thy table .
behold , that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the lord .
and there came forth a spirit , and stood before the lord , and said , i will persuade him .
and the lord said unto him , wherewith ? and he said , i will go forth , and i will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets . and he said , thou shalt persuade him , and prevail also : go forth , and do so .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
and the lord said , who shall persuade ahab , that he may go up and fall at ramoth - gilead ? and one said on this manner , and another said on that manner .
and the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession of the children of israel : from them that have many ye shall give many ; but from them that have few ye shall give few : every one shall give of his cities unto the levites according to his inheritance which he inheriteth .
and micaiah said , behold , thou shalt see in that day , when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself .
and the king of israel said , take micaiah , and carry him back unto amon the governor of the city , and to joash the king ' s son ;
now therefore , behold , the lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets , and the lord hath spoken evil concerning thee .
but zedekiah the son of chenaanah went near , and smote micaiah on the cheek , and said , which way went the spirit of the lord from me to speak unto thee ?
and among the cities which ye shall give unto the levites there shall be six cities for refuge , which ye shall appoint for the manslayer , that he may flee thither : and to them ye shall add forty and two cities .
so all the cities which ye shall give to the levites shall be forty and eight cities : them shall ye give with their suburbs .
and the lord spake unto moses in the plains of moab by jordan near jericho , saying ,
command the children of israel , that they give unto the levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in ; and ye shall give also unto the levites suburbs for the cities round about them .
and the cities shall they have to dwell in ; and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle , and for their goods , and for all their beasts .
and he shall bring his trespass offering unto the lord for his sin which he hath sinned , a female from the flock , a lamb or a kid of the goats , for a sin offering ; and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his sin .
he that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver ; nor he that loveth abundance with increase : this is also vanity .
and if he be not able to bring a lamb , then he shall bring for his trespass , which he hath committed , two turtledoves , or two young pigeons , unto the lord ; one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering .
and he shall bring them unto the priest , who shall offer that which is for the sin offering first , and wring off his head from his neck , but shall not divide it asunder :
the sleep of a labouring man is sweet , whether he eat little or much : but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep .
and he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar ; and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar : it is a sin offering .
as the nations which the lord destroyeth before your face , so shall ye perish ; because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of the lord your god .
when goods increase , they are increased that eat them : and what good is there to the owners thereof , saving the beholding of them with their eyes ?
who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness , wherein were fiery serpents , and scorpions , and drought , where there was no water ; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint ;
i will sing unto the lord , because he hath dealt bountifully with me .
all his days also he eateth in darkness , and he hath much sorrow and wrath with his sickness .
who fed thee in the wilderness with manna , which thy fathers knew not , that he might humble thee , and that he might prove thee , to do thee good at thy latter end ;
behold that which i have seen : it is good and comely for one to eat and to drink , and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life , which god giveth him : for it is his portion .
and thou say in thine heart , my power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth .
lest mine enemy say , i have prevailed against him ; and those that trouble me rejoice when i am moved .
every man also to whom god hath given riches and wealth , and hath given him power to eat thereof , and to take his portion , and to rejoice in his labour ; this is the gift of god .
but thou shalt remember the lord thy god : for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth , that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers , as it is this day .
but i have trusted in thy mercy ; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation .
and the king said unto him , how many times shall i adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the lord ?
and it shall be , if thou do at all forget the lord thy god , and walk after other gods , and serve them , and worship them , i testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish .
how long shall i take counsel in my soul , having sorrow in my heart daily ? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me ?
there is a sore evil which i have seen under the sun , namely , riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt .
and he said , i saw all israel scattered upon the hills , as sheep that have not a shepherd : and the lord said , these have no master : let them return every man to his house in peace .
consider and hear me , o lord my god : lighten mine eyes , lest i sleep the sleep of death ;
but those riches perish by evil travail : and he begetteth a son , and there is nothing in his hand .
and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat , did i not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me , but evil ?
as he came forth of his mother ' s womb , naked shall he return to go as he came , and shall take nothing of his labour , which he may carry away in his hand .
and he said , hear thou therefore the word of the lord : i saw the lord sitting on his throne , and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left .
how long wilt thou forget me , o lord ? for ever ? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me ?
and this also is a sore evil , that in all points as he came , so shall he go : and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind ?
and all the prophets prophesied so , saying , go up to ramoth - gilead , and prosper : for the lord shall deliver it into the king ' s hand .
and the messenger that was gone to call micaiah spake unto him , saying , behold now , the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth : let thy word , i pray thee , be like the word of one of them , and speak that which is good .
and micaiah said , as the lord liveth , what the lord saith unto me , that will i speak .
so he came to the king . and the king said unto him , micaiah , shall we go against ramoth - gilead to battle , or shall we forbear ? and he answered him , go , and prosper : for the lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king .
and the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah sat each on his throne , having put on their robes , in a void place in the entrance of the gate of samaria ; and all the prophets prophesied before them .
and zedekiah the son of chenaanah made him horns of iron : and he said , thus saith the lord , with these shalt thou push the syrians , until thou have consumed them .
when thou hast eaten and art full , then thou shalt bless the lord thy god for the good land which he hath given thee .
then thine heart be lifted up , and thou forget the lord thy god , which brought thee forth out of the land of egypt , from the house of bondage ;
and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply , and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied , and all that thou hast is multiplied ;
lest when thou hast eaten and art full , and hast built goodly houses , and dwelt therein ;
beware that thou forget not the lord thy god , in not keeping his commandments , and his judgments , and his statutes , which i command thee this day :
o give thanks unto the lord , for he is good : for his mercy endureth for ever .
and when they were gone aside , they talked between themselves , saying , this man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds .
then said agrippa unto festus , this man might have been set at liberty , if he had not appealed unto caesar .
having the same conflict which ye saw in me , and now hear to be in me .
joseph of arimathaea , and honourable counseller , which also waited for the kingdom of god , came , and went in boldly unto pilate , and craved the body of jesus .
and now when the even was come , because it was the preparation , that is , the day before the sabbath ,
and when he knew it of the centurion , he gave the body to joseph .
and pilate marvelled if he were already dead : and calling unto him the centurion , he asked him whether he had been any while dead .
( who also , when he was in galilee , followed him , and ministered unto him ; ) and many other women which came up with him unto jerusalem .
for he shall not much remember the days of his life ; because god answereth him in the joy of his heart .
there were also women looking on afar off : among whom was mary magdalene , and mary the mother of james the less and of joses , and salome ;
and gathered them out of the lands , from the east , and from the west , from the north , and from the south .
let the redeemed of the lord say so , whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy ;
hungry and thirsty , their soul fainted in them .
they wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way ; they found no city to dwell in .
and he bought fine linen , and took him down , and wrapped him in the linen , and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock , and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre .
and he led them forth by the right way , that they might go to a city of habitation .
and mary magdalene and mary the mother of joses beheld where he was laid .
then they cried unto the lord in their trouble , and he delivered them out of their distresses .
for he satisfieth the longing soul , and filleth the hungry soul with goodness .
oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness , and for his wonderful works to the children of men !
and i punished them oft in every synagogue , and compelled them to blaspheme ; and being exceedingly mad against them , i persecuted them even unto strange cities .
save thyself , and come down from the cross .
whereupon as i went to damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests ,
which thing i also did in jerusalem : and many of the saints did i shut up in prison , having received authority from the chief priests ; and when they were put to death , i gave my voice against them .
and i said , who art thou , lord ? and he said , i am jesus whom thou persecutest .
but rise , and stand upon thy feet : for i have appeared unto thee for this purpose , to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen , and of those things in the which i will appear unto thee ;
and when the sixth hour was come , there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour .
let christ the king of israel descend now from the cross , that we may see and believe . and they that were crucified with him reviled him .
and when we were all fallen to the earth , i heard a voice speaking unto me , and saying in the hebrew tongue , saul , saul , why persecutest thou me ? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks .
likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes , he saved others ; himself he cannot save .
whereupon , o king agrippa , i was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision :
and to wait for his son from heaven , whom he raised from the dead , even jesus , which delivered us from the wrath to come .
delivering thee from the people , and from the gentiles , unto whom now i send thee ,
but the other of love , knowing that i am set for the defence of the gospel .
what then ? notwithstanding , every way , whether in pretence , or in truth , christ is preached ; and i therein do rejoice , yea , and will rejoice .
for i know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer , and the supply of the spirit of jesus christ ,
so that my bonds in christ are manifest in all the palace , and in all other places ;
and many of the brethren in the lord , waxing confident by my bonds , are much more bold to speak the word without fear .
some indeed preach christ even of envy and strife ; and some also of good will :
and jesus cried with a loud voice , and gave up the ghost .
that ye may approve things that are excellent ; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of christ ;
and the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom .
being filled with the fruits of righteousness , which are by jesus christ , unto the glory and praise of god .
and some of them that stood by , when they heard it , said , behold , he calleth elias .
but i would ye should understand , brethren , that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel ;
and one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar , and put it on a reed , and gave him to drink , saying , let alone ; let us see whether elias will come to take him down .
and when the centurion , which stood over against him , saw that he so cried out , and gave up the ghost , he said , truly this man was the son of god .
but shewed first unto them of damascus , and at jerusalem , and throughout all the coasts of judaea , and then to the gentiles , that they should repent and turn to god , and do works meet for repentance .
for these causes the jews caught me in the temple , and went about to kill me .
having therefore obtained help of god , i continue unto this day , witnessing both to small and great , saying none other things than those which the prophets and moses did say should come :
that christ should suffer , and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead , and should shew light unto the people , and to the gentiles .
and as he thus spake for himself , festus said with a loud voice , paul , thou art beside thyself ; much learning doth make thee mad .
and they compel one simon a cyrenian , who passed by , coming out of the country , the father of alexander and rufus , to bear his cross .
but he said , i am not mad , most noble festus ; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness .
for the king knoweth of these things , before whom also i speak freely : for i am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him ; for this thing was not done in a corner .
and they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh : but he received it not .
and they bring him unto the place golgotha , which is , being interpreted , the place of a skull .
then agrippa said unto paul , almost thou persuadest me to be a christian .
and paul said , i would to god , that not only thou , but also all that hear me this day , were both almost , and altogether such as i am , except these bonds .
and in nothing terrified by your adversaries : which is to them an evident token of perdition , but to you of salvation , and that of god .
for unto you it is given in the behalf of christ , not only to believe on him , but also to suffer for his sake ;
that your rejoicing may be more abundant in jesus christ for me by my coming to you again .
only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of christ : that whether i come and see you , or else be absent , i may hear of your affairs , that ye stand fast in one spirit , with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel ;
nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you .
and having this confidence , i know that i shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith ;
but if i live in the flesh , this is the fruit of my labour : yet what i shall choose i wot not .
and when they had crucified him , they parted his garments , casting lots upon them , what every man should take .
for i am in a strait betwixt two , having a desire to depart , and to be with christ ; which is far better :
and it was the third hour , and they crucified him .
and the superscription of his accusation was written over , the king of the jews .
for to me to live is christ , and to die is gain .
and with him they crucify two thieves ; the one on his right hand , and the other on his left .
and the scripture was fulfilled , which saith , and he was numbered with the transgressors .
and they that passed by railed on him , wagging their heads , and saying , ah , thou that destroyest the temple , and buildest it in three days ,
and when he had thus spoken , the king rose up , and the governor , and bernice , and they that sat with them :
jesus answered , my kingdom is not of this world : if my kingdom were of this world , then would my servants fight , that i should not be delivered to the jews : but now is my kingdom not from hence .
know therefore that the lord thy god , he is god , the faithful god , which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations ;
the prophet that hath a dream , let him tell a dream ; and he that hath my word , let him speak my word faithfully . what is the chaff to the wheat ? saith the lord .
is not my word like as a fire ? saith the lord ; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces ?
jesus answered him , sayest thou this thing of thyself , or did others tell it thee of me ?
then pilate entered into the judgment hall again , and called jesus , and said unto him , art thou the king of the jews ?
but thus shall ye deal with them ; ye shall destroy their altars , and break down their images , and cut down their groves , and burn their graven images with fire .
but ye have a custom , that i should release unto you one at the passover : will ye therefore that i release unto you the king of the jews ?
for thou art an holy people unto the lord thy god : the lord thy god hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself , above all people that are upon the face of the earth .
pilate saith unto him , what is truth ? and when he had said this , he went out again unto the jews , and saith unto them , i find in him no fault at all .
the lord did not set his love upon you , nor choose you , because ye were more in number than any people ; for ye were the fewest of all people :
pilate therefore said unto him , art thou a king then ? jesus answered , thou sayest that i am a king . to this end was i born , and for this cause came i into the world , that i should bear witness unto the truth . every one that is of the truth heareth my voice .
but because the lord loved you , and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers , hath the lord brought you out with a mighty hand , and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen , from the hand of pharaoh king of egypt .
and of her that is sick of her flowers , and of him that hath an issue , of the man , and of the woman , and of him that lieth with her that is unclean .
this is the law of him that hath an issue , and of him whose seed goeth from him , and is defiled therewith ;
and when the lord thy god shall deliver them before thee ; thou shalt smite them , and utterly destroy them ; thou shalt make no covenant with them , nor shew mercy unto them :
neither shalt thou make marriages with them ; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son , nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son .
for they will turn away thy son from following me , that they may serve other gods : so will the anger of the lord be kindled against you , and destroy thee suddenly .
thus shall ye separate the children of israel from their uncleanness ; that they die not in their uncleanness , when they defile my tabernacle that is among them .
and the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering ; and the priest shall make an atonement for her before the lord for the issue of her uncleanness .
so joshua smote all the country of the hills , and of the south , and of the vale , and of the springs , and all their kings : he left none remaining , but utterly destroyed all that breathed , as the lord god of israel commanded .
and joshua passed from libnah , and all israel with him , unto lachish , and encamped against it , and fought against it :
and the lord delivered it also , and the king thereof , into the hand of israel ; and he smote it with the edge of the sword , and all the souls that were therein ; he let none remain in it ; but did unto the king thereof as he did unto the king of jericho .
then horam king of gezer came up to help lachish ; and joshua smote him and his people , until he had left him none remaining .
and the lord delivered lachish into the hand of israel , which took it on the second day , and smote it with the edge of the sword , and all the souls that were therein , according to all that he had done to libnah .
and they took it on that day , and smote it with the edge of the sword , and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day , according to all that he had done to lachish .
and from lachish joshua passed unto eglon , and all israel with him ; and they encamped against it , and fought against it :
and joshua went up from eglon , and all israel with him , unto hebron ; and they fought against it :
i have not sent these prophets , yet they ran : i have not spoken to them , yet they prophesied .
and joshua returned , and all israel with him , to debir ; and fought against it :
the anger of the lord shall not return , until he have executed , and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart : in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly .
am i a god at hand , saith the lord , and not a god afar off ?
but if they had stood in my counsel , and had caused my people to hear my words , then they should have turned them from their evil way , and from the evil of their doings .
then said pilate unto them , take ye him , and judge him according to your law . the jews therefore said unto him , it is not lawful for us to put any man to death :
behold , i am vile ; what shall i answer thee ? i will lay mine hand upon my mouth .
i have heard what the prophets said , that prophesy lies in my name , saying , i have dreamed , i have dreamed .
that the saying of jesus might be fulfilled , which he spake , signifying what death he should die .
then job answered the lord , and said ,
can any hide himself in secret places that i shall not see him ? saith the lord . do not i fill heaven and earth ? saith the lord .
shall he that contendeth with the almighty instruct him ? he that reproveth god , let him answer it .
which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour , as their fathers have forgotten my name for baal .
they answered and said unto him , if he were not a malefactor , we would not have delivered him up unto thee .
moreover the lord answered job , and said ,
how long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies ? yea , they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart ;
jesus answered him , if i have spoken evil , bear witness of the evil : but if well , why smitest thou me ?
and when he had thus spoken , one of the officers which stood by struck jesus with the palm of his hand , saying , answerest thou the high priest so ?
and simon peter stood and warmed himself . they said therefore unto him , art not thou also one of his disciples ? he denied it , and said , i am not .
therefore , behold , i , even i , will utterly forget you , and i will forsake you , and the city that i gave you and your fathers , and cast you out of my presence :
now annas had sent him bound unto caiaphas the high priest .
peter then denied again : and immediately the cock crew .
one of the servants of the high priest , being his kinsman whose ear peter cut off , saith , did not i see thee in the garden with him ?
pilate then went out unto them , and said , what accusation bring ye against this man ?
then led they jesus from caiaphas unto the hall of judgment : and it was early ; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall , lest they should be defiled ; but that they might eat the passover .
and if any man lie with her at all , and her flowers be upon him , he shall be unclean seven days ; and all the bed whereon he lieth shall be unclean .
and if it be on her bed , or on any thing whereon she sitteth , when he toucheth it , he shall be unclean until the even .
and whosoever toucheth any thing that she sat upon shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
and whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
and joshua returned , and all israel with him , unto the camp to gilgal .
and on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles , or two young pigeons , and bring them unto the priest , to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
and all these kings and their land did joshua take at one time , because the lord god of israel fought for israel .
and joshua smote them from kadesh - barnea even unto gaza , and all the country of goshen , even unto gibeon .
and whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean , and shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
therefore , behold , i am against the prophets , saith the lord , that steal my words every one from his neighbour .
but if she be cleansed of her issue , then she shall number to herself seven days , and after that she shall be clean .
and if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the time of her separation , or if it run beyond the time of her separation ; all the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall be as the days of her separation : she shall be unclean .
every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be unto her as the bed of her separation : and whatsoever she sitteth upon shall be unclean , as the uncleanness of her separation .
and as for the prophet , and the priest , and the people , that shall say , the burden of the lord , i will even punish that man and his house .
and when this people , or the prophet , or a priest , shall ask thee , saying , what is the burden of the lord ? thou shalt then say unto them , what burden ? i will even forsake you , saith the lord .
behold , i am against them that prophesy false dreams , saith the lord , and do tell them , and cause my people to err by their lies , and by their lightness ; yet i sent them not , nor commanded them : therefore they shall not profit this people at all , saith the lord .
behold , i am against the prophets , saith the lord , that use their tongues , and say , he saith .
but since ye say , the burden of the lord ; therefore thus saith the lord ; because ye say this word , the burden of the lord , and i have sent unto you , saying , ye shall not say , the burden of the lord ;
thus shalt thou say to the prophet , what hath the lord answered thee ? and , what hath the lord spoken ?
jesus answered him , i spake openly to the world ; i ever taught in the synagogue , and in the temple , whither the jews always resort ; and in secret have i said nothing .
and the burden of the lord shall ye mention no more : for every man ' s word shall be his burden ; for ye have perverted the words of the living god , of the lord of hosts our god .
why askest thou me ? ask them which heard me , what i have said unto them : behold , they know what i said .
thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour , and every one to his brother , what hath the lord answered ? and , what hath the lord spoken ?
and the servants and officers stood there , who had made a fire of coals ; for it was cold : and they warmed themselves : and peter stood with them , and warmed himself .
that i may see the good of thy chosen , that i may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation , that i may glory with thine inheritance .
then saith the damsel that kept the door unto peter , art not thou also one of this man ' s disciples ? he saith , i am not .
we have sinned with our fathers , we have committed iniquity , we have done wickedly .
but peter stood at the door without . then went out that other disciple , which was known unto the high priest , and spake unto her that kept the door , and brought in peter .
blessed are they that keep judgment , and he that doeth righteousness at all times .
and simon peter followed jesus , and so did another disciple : that disciple was known unto the high priest , and went in with jesus into the palace of the high priest .
remember me , o lord , with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people : o visit me with thy salvation ;
now caiaphas was he , which gave counsel to the jews , that it was expedient that one man should die for the people .
the sons of shimei ; shelomith , and haziel , and haran , three . these were the chief of the fathers of laadan .
he rebuked the red sea also , and it was dried up : so he led them through the depths , as through the wilderness .
and led him away to annas first ; for he was father in law to caiaphas , which was the high priest that same year .
then the band and the captain and officers of the jews took jesus , and bound him ,
our fathers understood not thy wonders in egypt ; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies ; but provoked him at the sea , even at the red sea .
then said jesus unto peter , put up thy sword into the sheath : the cup which my father hath given me , shall i not drink it ?
nevertheless he saved them for his name ' s sake , that he might make his mighty power to be known .
the high priest then asked jesus of his disciples , and of his doctrine .
and the sun stood still , and the moon stayed , until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies . is not this written in the book of jasher ? so the sun stood still in the midst of heaven , and hasted not to go down about a whole day .
and joshua returned , and all israel with him , unto the camp to gilgal .
and there was no day like that before it or after it , that the lord hearkened unto the voice of a man : for the lord fought for israel .
and she had a garment of divers colours upon her : for with such robes were the king ' s daughters that were virgins apparelled . then his servant brought her out , and bolted the door after her .
then he called his servant that ministered unto him , and said , put now this woman out from me , and bolt the door after her .
and tamar put ashes on her head , and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her , and laid her hand on her head , and went on crying .
and the lord discomfited them before israel , and slew them with a great slaughter at gibeon , and chased them along the way that goeth up to beth - horon , and smote them to azekah , and unto makkedah .
and david divided them into courses among the sons of levi , namely , gershon , kohath , and merari .
howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice : but , being stronger than she , forced her , and lay with her .
then simon peter having a sword drew it , and smote the high priest ' s servant , and cut off his right ear . the servant ' s name was malchus .
moreover four thousand were porters ; and four thousand praised the lord with the instruments which i made , said david , to praise therewith .
and i , whither shall i cause my shame to go ? and as for thee , thou shalt be as one of the fools in israel . now therefore , i pray thee , speak unto the king ; for he will not withhold me from thee .
the sons of laadan ; the chief was jehiel , and zetham , and joel , three .
and she said unto him , there is no cause : this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me . but he would not hearken unto her .
of the gershonites were , laadan , and shimei .
then amnon hated her exceedingly ; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her . and amnon said unto her , arise , be gone .
and he gathered together all the princes of israel , with the priests and the levites .
and amnon said unto tamar , bring the meat into the chamber , that i may eat of thine hand . and tamar took the cakes which she had made , and brought them into the chamber to amnon her brother .
and it was told joshua , saying , the five kings are found hid in a cave at makkedah .
so when david was old and full of days , he made solomon his son king over israel .
but these five kings fled , and hid themselves in a cave at makkedah .
of which , twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work of the house of the lord ; and six thousand were officers and judges :
and she answered him , nay , my brother , do not force me ; for no such thing ought to be done in israel : do not thou this folly .
and stay ye not , but pursue after your enemies , and smite the hindmost of them ; suffer them not to enter into their cities : for the lord your god hath delivered them into your hand .
now the levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward : and their number by their polls , man by man , was thirty and eight thousand .
and when she had brought them unto him to eat , he took hold of her , and said unto her , come lie with me , my sister .
and joshua said , roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave , and set men by it for to keep them :
they say still unto them that despise me , the lord hath said , ye shall have peace ; and they say unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart , no evil shall come upon you .
for who hath stood in the counsel of the lord , and hath perceived and heard his word ? who hath marked his word , and heard it ?
and afterward joshua smote them , and slew them , and hanged them on five trees : and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening .
and joshua said unto them , fear not , nor be dismayed , be strong and of good courage : for thus shall the lord do to all your enemies against whom ye fight .
and they did so , and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave , the king of jerusalem , the king of hebron , the king of jarmuth , the king of lachish , and the king of eglon .
then said joshua , open the mouth of the cave , and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave .
and all the people returned to the camp to joshua at makkedah in peace : none moved his tongue against any of the children of israel .
and it came to pass , when joshua and the children of israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter , till they were consumed , that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced cities .
thus saith the lord of hosts , hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you : they make you vain : they speak a vision of their own heart , and not out of the mouth of the lord .
therefore thus saith the lord of hosts concerning the prophets ; behold , i will feed them with wormwood , and make them drink the water of gall : for from the prophets of jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land .
i have seen also in the prophets of jerusalem an horrible thing : they commit adultery , and walk in lies : they strengthen also the hands of evildoers , that none doth return from his wickedness : they are all of them unto me as sodom , and the inhabitants thereof as gomorrah .
and i have seen folly in the prophets of samaria ; they prophesied in baal , and caused my people israel to err .
wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery ways in the darkness : they shall be driven on , and fall therein : for i will bring evil upon them , even the year of their visitation , saith the lord .
then joshua passed from makkedah , and all israel with him , unto libnah , and fought against libnah :
for both prophet and priest are profane ; yea , in my house have i found their wickedness , saith the lord .
and that day joshua took makkedah , and smote it with the edge of the sword , and the king thereof he utterly destroyed , them , and all the souls that were therein ; he let none remain : and he did to the king of makkedah as he did unto the king of jericho .
who can utter the mighty acts of the lord ? who can shew forth all his praise ?
for the land is full of adulterers ; for because of swearing the land mourneth ; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up , and their course is evil , and their force is not right .
and it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun , that joshua commanded , and they took them down off the trees , and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid , and laid great stones in the cave ' s mouth , which remain until this very day .
praise ye the lord . o give thanks unto the lord ; for he is good : for his mercy endureth for ever .
so he brought him into his house , and gave provender unto the asses : and they washed their feet , and did eat and drink .
but the men would not hearken to him : so the man took his concubine , and brought her forth unto them ; and they knew her , and abused her all the night until the morning : and when the day began to spring , they let her go .
then came the woman in the dawning of the day , and fell down at the door of the man ' s house where her lord was , till it was light .
and her lord rose up in the morning , and opened the doors of the house , and went out to go his way : and , behold , the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house , and her hands were upon the threshold .
and he said unto her , up , and let us be going . but none answered . then the man took her up upon an ass , and the man rose up , and gat him unto his place .
and it came to pass , while they were in the way , that tidings came to david , saying , absalom hath slain all the king ' s sons , and there is not one of them left .
and the old man said , peace be with thee ; howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me ; only lodge not in the street .
then the king arose , and tare his garments , and lay on the earth ; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent .
now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart , to think that all the king ' s sons are dead : for amnon only is dead .
but absalom fled . and the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , behold , there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him .
and jonadab said unto the king , behold , the king ' s sons come : as thy servant said , so it is .
and it came to pass , as soon as he had made an end of speaking , that , behold , the king ' s sons came , and lifted up their voice and wept : and the king also and all his servants wept very sore .
but absalom fled , and went to talmai , the son of ammihud , king of geshur . and david mourned for his son every day .
so absalom fled , and went to geshur , and was there three years .
and the soul of king david longed to go forth unto absalom : for he was comforted concerning amnon , seeing he was dead .
yet there is both straw and provender for our asses ; and there is bread and wine also for me , and for thy handmaid , and for the young man which is with thy servants : there is no want of any thing .
and he said unto him , we are passing from bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount ephraim ; from thence am i : and i went to bethlehemjudah , but i am now going to the house of the lord ; and there is no man that receiveth me to house .
and it was so , that all that saw it said , there was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of israel came up out of the land of egypt unto this day : consider of it , take advice , and speak your minds .
and absalom spake unto his brother amnon neither good nor bad : for absalom hated amnon , because he had forced his sister tamar .
and it came to pass after two full years , that absalom had sheepshearers in baal - hazor , which is beside ephraim : and absalom invited all the king ' s sons .
and the two kidneys , and the fat that is upon them , which is by the flanks , and the caul above the liver , with the kidneys , it shall he take away ,
and absalom her brother said unto her , hath amnon thy brother been with thee ? but hold now thy peace , my sister : he is thy brother ; regard not this thing . so tamar remained desolate in her brother absalom ' s house .
and he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the sin offering ; the fat that covereth the inwards , and all the fat that is upon the inwards ,
but when king david heard of all these things , he was very wroth .
then said absalom , if not , i pray thee , let my brother amnon go with us . and the king said unto him , why should he go with thee ?
but absalom pressed him , that he let amnon and all the king ' s sons go with him .
and the king said to absalom , nay , my son , let us not all now go , lest we be chargeable unto thee . and he pressed him : howbeit he would not go , but blessed him .
and prevailed not ; neither was their place found any more in heaven .
and the great dragon was cast out , that old serpent , called the devil , and satan , which deceiveth the whole world : he was cast out into the earth , and his angels were cast out with him .
and the woman fled into the wilderness , where she hath a place prepared of god , that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days .
now absalom had commanded his servants , saying , mark ye now when amnon ' s heart is merry with wine , and when i say unto you , smite amnon ; then kill him , fear not : have not i commanded you ? be courageous and be valiant .
and there was war in heaven : michael and his angels fought against the dragon ; and the dragon fought and his angels ,
and the servants of absalom did unto amnon as absalom had commanded . then all the king ' s sons arose , and every man gat him up upon his mule , and fled .
and when he was come into his house , he took a knife , and laid hold on his concubine , and divided her , together with her bones , into twelve pieces , and sent her into all the coasts of israel .
and there appeared another wonder in heaven ; and behold a great red dragon , having seven heads and ten horns , and seven crowns upon his heads .
and she being with child cried , travailing in birth , and pained to be delivered .
and she brought forth a man child , who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron : and her child was caught up unto god , and to his throne .
and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven , and did cast them to the earth : and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered , for to devour her child as soon as it was born .
and whosoever toucheth any thing that was under him shall be unclean until the even : and he that beareth any of those things shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
and whomsoever he toucheth that hath the issue , and hath not rinsed his hands in water , he shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
and there appeared a great wonder in heaven ; a woman clothed with the sun , and the moon under her feet , and upon her head a crown of twelve stars :
and the vessel of earth , that he toucheth which hath the issue , shall be broken : and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water .
and when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue ; then he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing , and wash his clothes , and bathe his flesh in running water , and shall be clean .
and every garment , and every skin , whereon is the seed of copulation , shall be washed with water , and be unclean until the even .
and i will bring an everlasting reproach upon you , and a perpetual shame , which shall not be forgotten .
and if any man ' s seed of copulation go out from him , then he shall wash all his flesh in water , and be unclean until the even .
and if a woman have an issue , and her issue in her flesh be blood , she shall be put apart seven days : and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean until the even .
the woman also with whom man shall lie with seed of copulation , they shall both bathe themselves in water , and be unclean until the even .
and , behold , there came an old man from his work out of the field at even , which was also of mount ephraim ; and he sojourned in gibeah : but the men of the place were benjamites .
now when she saw that she had waited , and her hope was lost , then she took another of her whelps , and made him a young lion .
and when he had lifted up his eyes , he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city : and the old man said , whither goest thou ? and whence comest thou ?
the nations also heard of him ; he was taken in their pit , and they brought him with chains unto the land of egypt .
and they passed on and went their way ; and the sun went down upon them when they were by gibeah , which belongeth to benjamin .
and he knew their desolate palaces , and he laid waste their cities ; and the land was desolate , and the fulness thereof , by the noise of his roaring .
and they turned aside thither , to go in and to lodge in gibeah : and when he went in , he sat him down in a street of the city : for there was no man that took them into his house to lodging .
and he went up and down among the lions , he became a young lion , and learned to catch the prey , and devoured men .
and his master said unto him , we will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger , that is not of the children of israel ; we will pass over to gibeah .
and they put him in ward in chains , and brought him to the king of babylon : they brought him into holds , that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of israel .
and he said unto his servant , come , and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night , in gibeah , or in ramah .
then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces , and spread their net over him : he was taken in their pit .
and the inhabitants of jerusalem made ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead : for the band of men that came with the arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest . so ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah reigned .
but the man would not tarry that night , but he rose up and departed , and came over against jebus , which is jerusalem ; and there were with him two asses saddled , his concubine also was with him .
forty and two years old was ahaziah when he began to reign , and he reigned one year in jerusalem . his mother ' s name also was athaliah the daughter of omri .
and when they were by jebus , the day was far spent ; and the servant said unto his master , come , i pray thee , and let us turn in into this city of the jebusites , and lodge in it .
he also walked in the ways of the house of ahab : for his mother was his counseller to do wickedly .
wherefore he did evil in the sight of the lord like the house of ahab : for they were his counsellers after the death of his father to his destruction .
he walked also after their counsel , and went with jehoram the son of ahab king of israel to war against hazael king of syria at ramoth - gilead : and the syrians smote joram .
and he returned to be healed in jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at ramah , when he fought with hazael king of syria . and azariah the son of jehoram king of judah went down to see jehoram the son of ahab at jezreel , because he was sick .
and the destruction of ahaziah was of god by coming to joram : for when he was come , he went out with jehoram against jehu the son of nimshi , whom the lord had anointed to cut off the house of ahab .
moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of israel ,
and it came to pass , that , when jehu was executing judgment upon the house of ahab , and found the princes of judah , and the sons of the brethren of ahaziah , that ministered to ahaziah , he slew them .
and she brought up one of her whelps : it became a young lion , and it learned to catch the prey ; it devoured men .
and say , what is thy mother ? a lioness : she lay down among lions , she nourished her whelps among young lions .
thus ezekiel is unto you a sign : according to all that he hath done shall ye do : and when this cometh , ye shall know that i am the lord god .
also , thou son of man , shall it not be in the day when i take from them their strength , the joy of their glory , the desire of their eyes , and that whereupon they set their minds , their sons and their daughters ,
that he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee , to cause thee to hear it with thine ears ?
in that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped , and thou shalt speak , and be no more dumb : and thou shalt be a sign unto them ; and they shall know that i am the lord .
then i answered them , the word of the lord came unto me , saying ,
speak unto the house of israel , thus saith the lord god ; behold , i will profane my sanctuary , the excellency of your strength , the desire of your eyes , and that which your soul pitieth ; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the sword .
and ye shall do as i have done : ye shall not cover your lips , nor eat the bread of men .
and your tires shall be upon your heads , and your shoes upon your feet : ye shall not mourn nor weep ; but ye shall pine away for your iniquities , and mourn one toward another .
let nothing be done through strife or vainglory ; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves .
look not every man on his own things , but every man also on the things of others .
if there be therefore any consolation in christ , if any comfort of love , if any fellowship of the spirit , if any bowels and mercies ,
fulfil ye my joy , that ye be likeminded , having the same love , being of one accord , of one mind .
now naaman , captain of the host of the king of syria , was a great man with his master , and honourable , because by him the lord had given deliverance unto syria : he was also a mighty man in valour , but he was a leper .
and the syrians had gone out by companies , and had brought away captive out of the land of israel a little maid ; and she waited on naaman ' s wife .
and one went in , and told his lord , saying , thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of israel .
and she said unto her mistress , would god my lord were with the prophet that is in samaria ! for he would recover him of his leprosy .
and he brought the letter to the king of israel , saying , now when this letter is come unto thee , behold , i have therewith sent naaman my servant to thee , that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy .
wherefore god also hath highly exalted him , and given him a name which is above every name :
and the king of syria said , go to , go , and i will send a letter unto the king of israel . and he departed , and took with him ten talents of silver , and six thousand pieces of gold , and ten changes of raiment .
great is the lord , and greatly to be praised in the city of our god , in the mountain of his holiness .
and being found in fashion as a man , he humbled himself , and became obedient unto death , even the death of the cross .
beautiful for situation , the joy of the whole earth , is mount zion , on the sides of the north , the city of the great king .
and the people said unto me , wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us , that thou doest so ?
but made himself of no reputation , and took upon him the form of a servant , and was made in the likeness of men :
god is known in her palaces for a refuge .
who , being in the form of god , thought it not robbery to be equal with god :
for , lo , the kings were assembled , they passed by together .
forbear to cry , make no mourning for the dead , bind the tire of thine head upon thee , and put on thy shoes upon thy feet , and cover not thy lips , and eat not the bread of men .
let this mind be in you , which was also in christ jesus :
so naaman came with his horses and with his chariot , and stood at the door of the house of elisha .
they saw it , and so they marvelled ; they were troubled , and hasted away .
fear took hold upon them there , and pain , as of a woman in travail .
also the word of the lord came unto me , saying ,
thou breakest the ships of tarshish with an east wind .
son of man , behold , i take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke : yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep , neither shall thy tears run down .
as we have heard , so have we seen in the city of the lord of hosts , in the city of our god : god will establish it for ever . selah .
in thy filthiness is lewdness : because i have purged thee , and thou wast not purged , thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more , till i have caused my fury to rest upon thee .
we have thought of thy lovingkindness , o god , in the midst of thy temple .
i the lord have spoken it : it shall come to pass , and i will do it ; i will not go back , neither will i spare , neither will i repent ; according to thy ways , and according to thy doings , shall they judge thee , saith the lord god .
then set it empty upon the coals thereof , that the brass of it may be hot , and may burn , and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it , that the scum of it may be consumed .
she hath wearied herself with lies , and her great scum went not forth out of her : her scum shall be in the fire .
heap on wood , kindle the fire , consume the flesh , and spice it well , and let the bones be burned .
and an angel of the lord came up from gilgal to bochim , and said , i made you to go up out of egypt , and have brought you unto the land which i sware unto your fathers ; and i said , i will never break my covenant with you .
and ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land ; ye shall throw down their altars : but ye have not obeyed my voice : why have ye done this ?
wherefore i also said , i will not drive them out from before you ; but they shall be as thorns in your sides , and their gods shall be a snare unto you .
and it came to pass , when the angel of the lord spake these words unto all the children of israel , that the people lifted up their voice , and wept .
and they called the name of that place bochim : and they sacrificed there unto the lord .
and when joshua had let the people go , the children of israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land .
not of works , lest any man should boast .
and the people served the lord all the days of joshua , and all the days of the elders that outlived joshua , who had seen all the great works of the lord , that he did for israel .
and joshua the son of nun , the servant of the lord , died , being an hundred and ten years old .
and they buried him in the border of his inheritance in timnath - heres , in the mount of ephraim , on the north side of the hill gaash .
and the messengers returned to jacob , saying , we came to thy brother esau , and also he cometh to meet thee , and four hundred men with him .
and i have oxen , and asses , flocks , and menservants , and womenservants : and i have sent to tell my lord , that i may find grace in thy sight .
then jacob was greatly afraid and distressed : and he divided the people that was with him , and the flocks , and herds , and the camels , into two bands ;
and jacob said , o god of my father abraham , and god of my father isaac , the lord which saidst unto me , return unto thy country , and to thy kindred , and i will deal well with thee :
and were baptized of him in jordan , confessing their sins .
then went out to him jerusalem , and all judaea , and all the region round about jordan ,
bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance :
but when he saw many of the pharisees and sadducees come to his baptism , he said unto them , o generation of vipers , who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
and think not to say within yourselves , we have abraham to our father : for i say unto you , that god is able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham .
and jacob went on his way , and the angels of god met him .
and when jacob saw them , he said , this is god ' s host : and he called the name of that place mahanaim .
and jacob sent messengers before him to esau his brother unto the land of seir , the country of edom .
and he commanded them , saying , thus shall ye speak unto my lord esau ; thy servant jacob saith thus , i have sojourned with laban , and stayed there until now :
and you hath he quickened , who were dead in trespasses and sins ;
then spake the lord to paul in the night by a vision , be not afraid , but speak , and hold not thy peace :
wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world , according to the prince of the power of the air , the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience :
among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh , fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind ; and were by nature the children of wrath , even as others .
but god , who is rich in mercy , for his great love wherewith he loved us ,
and crispus , the chief ruler of the synagogue , believed on the lord with all his house ; and many of the corinthians hearing believed , and were baptized .
even when we were dead in sins , hath quickened us together with christ , ( by grace ye are saved ; )
and hath raised us up together , and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus :
that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through christ jesus .
for by grace are ye saved through faith ; and that not of yourselves : it is the gift of god :
after these things paul departed from athens , and came to corinth ;
and found a certain jew named aquila , born in pontus , lately come from italy , with his wife priscilla ; ( because that claudius had commanded all jews to depart from rome : ) and came unto them .
and when silas and timotheus were come from macedonia , paul was pressed in the spirit , and testified to the jews that jesus was christ .
and when they opposed themselves , and blasphemed , he shook his raiment , and said unto them , your blood be upon your own heads ; i am clean : from henceforth i will go unto the gentiles .
and because he was of the same craft , he abode with them , and wrought : for by their occupation they were tentmakers .
and he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath , and persuaded the jews and the greeks .
and , thou , lord , in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth ; and the heavens are the works of thine hands :
and as a vesture shalt thou fold them up , and they shall be changed : but thou art the same , and thy years shall not fail .
they shall perish ; but thou remainest ; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment ;
are they not all ministering spirits , sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation ?
but to which of the angels said he at any time , sit on my right hand , until i make thine enemies thy footstool ?
then cried they all again , saying , not this man , but barabbas . now barabbas was a robber .
hast thou an arm like god ? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him ?
wilt thou also disannul my judgment ? wilt thou condemn me , that thou mayest be righteous ?
gird up thy loins now like a man : i will demand of thee , and declare thou unto me .
then answered the lord unto job out of the whirlwind , and said ,
once have i spoken ; but i will not answer : yea , twice ; but i will proceed no further .
i will lay thy cities waste , and thou shalt be desolate , and thou shalt know that i am the lord .
son of man , set thy face against mount seir , and prophesy against it ,
and say unto it , thus saith the lord god ; behold , o mount seir , i am against thee , and i will stretch out mine hand against thee , and i will make thee most desolate .
and i will fill his mountains with his slain men : in thy hills , and in thy valleys , and in all thy rivers , shall they fall that are slain with the sword .
i will make thee perpetual desolations , and thy cities shall not return : and ye shall know that i am the lord .
therefore , as i live , saith the lord god , i will prepare thee unto blood , and blood shall pursue thee : sith thou hast not hated blood , even blood shall pursue thee .
thus will i make mount seir most desolate , and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth .
every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away : and every branch that beareth fruit , he purgeth it , that it may bring forth more fruit .
i am the true vine , and my father is the husbandman .
and they laughed him to scorn . but when he had put them all out , he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel , and them that were with him , and entereth in where the damsel was lying .
and he took the damsel by the hand , and said unto her , talitha cumi ; which is , being interpreted , damsel , i say unto thee , arise .
and straightway the damsel arose , and walked ; for she was of the age of twelve years . and they were astonished with a great astonishment .
and he charged them straitly that no man should know it ; and commanded that something should be given her to eat .
moreover the word of the lord came unto me , saying ,
but all the israelites went down to the philistines , to sharpen every man his share , and his coulter , and his axe , and his mattock .
now ye are clean through the word which i have spoken unto you .
abide in me , and i in you . as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself , except it abide in the vine ; no more can ye , except ye abide in me .
and the garrison of the philistines went out to the passage of michmash .
i am the vine , ye are the branches : he that abideth in me , and i in him , the same bringeth forth much fruit : for without me ye can do nothing .
so it came to pass in the day of battle , that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with saul and jonathan : but with saul and with jonathan his son was there found .
if a man abide not in me , he is cast forth as a branch , and is withered ; and men gather them , and cast them into the fire , and they are burned .
yet they had a file for the mattocks , and for the coulters , and for the forks , and for the axes , and to sharpen the goads .
if ye abide in me , and my words abide in you , ye shall ask what ye will , and it shall be done unto you .
herein is my father glorified , that ye bear much fruit ; so shall ye be my disciples .
as the father hath loved me , so have i loved you : continue ye in my love .
but the prophet , which shall presume to speak a word in my name , which i have not commanded him to speak , or that shall speak in the name of other gods , even that prophet shall die .
is the seed yet in the barn ? yea , as yet the vine , and the fig tree , and the pomegranate , and the olive tree , hath not brought forth : from this day will i bless you .
and jehoash the son of jehoahaz took again out of the hand of ben - hadad the son of hazael the cities , which he had taken out of the hand of jehoahaz his father by war . three times did joash beat him , and recovered the cities of israel .
i will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren , like unto thee , and will put my words in his mouth ; and he shall speak unto them all that i shall command him .
in the four and twentieth day of the ninth month , in the second year of darius , came the word of the lord by haggai the prophet , saying ,
so hazael king of syria died ; and ben - hadad his son reigned in his stead .
and it shall come to pass , that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name , i will require it of him .
and it came to pass , as they were burying a man , that , behold , they spied a band of men ; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of elisha : and when the man was let down , and touched the bones of elisha , he revived , and stood up on his feet .
and elisha died , and they buried him . and the bands of the moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year .
and the lord was gracious unto them , and had compassion on them , and had respect unto them , because of his covenant with abraham , isaac , and jacob , and would not destroy them , neither cast he them from his presence as yet .
but hazael king of syria oppressed israel all the days of jehoahaz .
there shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire , or that useth divination , or an observer of times , or an enchanter , or a witch ,
consider now from this day and upward , from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month , even from the day that the foundation of the lord ' s temple was laid , consider it .
or a charmer , or a consulter with familiar spirits , or a wizard , or a necromancer .
i smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the labours of your hands ; yet ye turned not to me , saith the lord .
for all that do these things are an abomination unto the lord : and because of these abominations the lord thy god doth drive them out from before thee .
since those days were , when one came to an heap of twenty measures , there were but ten : when one came to the pressfat for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press , there were but twenty .
thou shalt be perfect with the lord thy god .
for these nations , which thou shalt possess , hearkened unto observers of times , and unto diviners : but as for thee , the lord thy god hath not suffered thee so to do .
then answered haggai , and said , so is this people , and so is this nation before me , saith the lord ; and so is every work of their hands ; and that which they offer there is unclean .
the lord thy god will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee , of thy brethren , like unto me ; unto him ye shall hearken ;
then said haggai , if one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these , shall it be unclean ? and the priests answered and said , it shall be unclean .
according to all that thou desiredst of the lord thy god in horeb in the day of the assembly , saying , let me not hear again the voice of the lord my god , neither let me see this great fire any more , that i die not .
if one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment , and with his skirt do touch bread , or pottage , or wine , or oil , or any meat , shall it be holy ? and the priests answered and said , no .
and the lord said unto me , they have well spoken that which they have spoken .
thus saith the lord of hosts ; ask now the priests concerning the law , saying ,
and he said to the king of israel , put thine hand upon the bow . and he put his hand upon it : and elisha put his hands upon the king ' s hands .
now elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died . and joash the king of israel came down unto him , and wept over his face , and said , o my father , my father , the chariot of israel , and the horsemen thereof .
and joash slept with his fathers ; and jeroboam sat upon his throne : and joash was buried in samaria with the kings of israel .
and the rest of the acts of joash , and all that he did , and his might wherewith he fought against amaziah king of judah , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel ?
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord ; he departed not from all the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat , who made israel sin : but he walked therein .
in the thirty and seventh year of joash king of judah began jehoash the son of jehoahaz to reign over israel in samaria , and reigned sixteen years .
and if thou say in thine heart , how shall we know the word which the lord hath not spoken ?
when a prophet speaketh in the name of the lord , if the thing follow not , nor come to pass , that is the thing which the lord hath not spoken , but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously : thou shalt not be afraid of him .
and the man of god was wroth with him , and said , thou shouldest have smitten five or six times ; then hadst thou smitten syria till thou hadst consumed it : whereas now thou shalt smite syria but thrice .
and he said , take the arrows . and he took them . and he said unto the king of israel , smite upon the ground . and he smote thrice , and stayed .
and he said , open the window eastward . and he opened it . then elisha said , shoot . and he shot . and he said , the arrow of the lord ' s deliverance , and the arrow of deliverance from syria : for thou shalt smite the syrians in aphek , till thou have consumed them .
and god hearkened unto leah , and she conceived , and bare jacob the fifth son .
and jacob came out of the field in the evening , and leah went out to meet him , and said , thou must come in unto me ; for surely i have hired thee with my son ' s mandrakes . and he lay with her that night .
and leah said , god hath given me my hire , because i have given my maiden to my husband : and she called his name issachar .
and leah said , happy am i , for the daughters will call me blessed : and she called his name asher .
and zilpah leah ' s maid bare jacob a second son .
and she said unto her , is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband ? and wouldest thou take away my son ' s mandrakes also ? and rachel said , therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son ' s mandrakes .
and reuben went in the days of wheat harvest , and found mandrakes in the field , and brought them unto his mother leah . then rachel said to leah , give me , i pray thee , of thy son ' s mandrakes .
and leah said , a troop cometh : and she called his name gad .
and zilpah leah ' s maid bare jacob a son .
and they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts .
and he said unto him , thou knowest how i have served thee , and how thy cattle was with me .
and they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil , and also concerning the swine .
and he said , appoint me thy wages , and i will give it .
and they come to jesus , and see him that was possessed with the devil , and had the legion , sitting , and clothed , and in his right mind : and they were afraid .
and laban said unto him , i pray thee , if i have found favour in thine eyes , tarry : for i have learned by experience that the lord hath blessed me for thy sake .
and they that fed the swine fled , and told it in the city , and in the country . and they went out to see what it was that was done .
give me my wives and my children , for whom i have served thee , and let me go : for thou knowest my service which i have done thee .
and it came to pass , when rachel had born joseph , that jacob said unto laban , send me away , that i may go unto mine own place , and to my country .
and she called his name joseph ; and said , the lord shall add to me another son .
howbeit jesus suffered him not , but saith unto him , go home to thy friends , and tell them how great things the lord hath done for thee , and hath had compassion on thee .
and she conceived , and bare a son ; and said , god hath taken away my reproach :
and when he was come into the ship , he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him .
and god remembered rachel , and god hearkened to her , and opened her womb .
and afterwards she bare a daughter , and called her name dinah .
and leah said , god hath endued me with a good dowry ; now will my husband dwell with me , because i have born him six sons : and she called his name zebulun .
and forthwith jesus gave them leave . and the unclean spirits went out , and entered into the swine : and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea , ( they were about two thousand ; ) and were choked in the sea .
and all the devils besought him , saying , send us into the swine , that we may enter into them .
now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding .
and he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country .
and the staves shall be put into the rings , and the staves shall be upon the two sides of the altar , to bear it .
hollow with boards shalt thou make it : as it was shewed thee in the mount , so shall they make it .
and thou shalt make the court of the tabernacle : for the south side southward there shall be hangings for the court of fine twined linen of an hundred cubits long for one side :
and thou shalt make his pans to receive his ashes , and his shovels , and his basons , and his fleshhooks , and his firepans : all the vessels thereof thou shalt make of brass .
and thou shalt make for it a grate of network of brass ; and upon the net shalt thou make four brasen rings in the four corners thereof .
and thou shalt put it under the compass of the altar beneath , that the net may be even to the midst of the altar .
and thou shalt make staves for the altar , staves of shittim wood , and overlay them with brass .
though i might also have confidence in the flesh . if any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh , i more :
and it shall come to pass in that day , saith the lord , that i will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee , and i will destroy thy chariots :
circumcised the eighth day , of the stock of israel , of the tribe of benjamin , an hebrew of the hebrews ; as touching the law , a pharisee ;
concerning zeal , persecuting the church ; touching the righteousness which is in the law , blameless .
and thou shalt make an altar of shittim wood , five cubits long , and five cubits broad ; the altar shall be foursquare : and the height thereof shall be three cubits .
but what things were gain to me , those i counted loss for christ .
and thou shalt make the horns of it upon the four corners thereof : his horns shall be of the same : and thou shalt overlay it with brass .
yea doubtless , and i count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord : for whom i have suffered the loss of all things , and do count them but dung , that i may win christ ,
and i will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee : so will i destroy thy cities .
and be found in him , not having mine own righteousness , which is of the law , but that which is through the faith of christ , the righteousness which is of god by faith :
thy graven images also will i cut off , and thy standing images out of the midst of thee ; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands .
and i will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand ; and thou shalt have no more soothsayers :
and i will cut off the cities of thy land , and throw down all thy strong holds :
and he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted , and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted , and every one that had some white in it , and all the brown among the sheep , and gave them into the hand of his sons .
and laban said , behold , i would it might be according to thy word .
and straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up ; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague .
and jacob took him rods of green poplar , and of the hazel and chesnut tree ; and pilled white strakes in them , and made the white appear which was in the rods .
and i will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen , such as they have not heard .
and he set three days ' journey betwixt himself and jacob : and jacob fed the rest of laban ' s flocks .
finally , my brethren , rejoice in the lord . to write the same things to you , to me indeed is not grievous , but for you it is safe .
a nd anot her company turned the way to beth - horon : and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of zeboim toward the wilderness .
and the flocks conceived before the rods , and brought forth cattle ringstraked , speckled , and spotted .
and had suffered many things of many physicians , and had spent all that she had , and was nothing bettered , but rather grew worse ,
now there was no smith found throughout all the land of israel : for the philistines said , lest the hebrews make them swords or spears :
and he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink , that they should conceive when they came to drink .
and a certain woman , which had an issue of blood twelve years ,
for we are the circumcision , which worship god in the spirit , and rejoice in christ jesus , and have no confidence in the flesh .
for she said , if i may touch but his clothes , i shall be whole .
beware of dogs , beware of evil workers , beware of the concision .
when she had heard of jesus , came in the press behind , and touched his garment .
and , behold , there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue , jairus by name ; and when he saw him , he fell at his feet ,
and samuel arose , and gat him up from gilgal unto gibeah of benjamin . and saul numbered the people that were present with him , about six hundred men .
and when jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side , much people gathered unto him : and he was nigh unto the sea .
and saul , and jonathan his son , and the people that were present with them , abode in gibeah of benjamin : but the philistines encamped in michmash .
and jesus went with him ; and much people followed him , and thronged him .
and the spoilers came out of the camp of the philistines in three companies : one company turned unto the way that leadeth to ophrah , unto the land of shual :
and besought him greatly , saying , my little daughter lieth at the point of death : i pray thee , come and lay thy hands on her , that she may be healed ; and she shall live .
and it came to pass , that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering , behold , samuel came ; and saul went out to meet him , that he might salute him .
and he said , what shall i give thee ? and jacob said , thou shalt not give me any thing : if thou wilt do this thing for me , i will again feed and keep thy flock :
and samuel said , what hast thou done ? and saul said , because i saw that the people were scattered from me , and that thou camest not within the days appointed , and that the philistines gathered themselves together at michmash ;
for it was little which thou hadst before i came , and it is now increased unto a multitude ; and the lord hath blessed thee since my coming : and now when shall i provide for mine own house also ?
therefore said i , the philistines will come down now upon me to gilgal , and i have not made supplication unto the lord : i forced myself therefore , and offered a burnt offering .
so shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come , when it shall come for my hire before thy face : every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats , and brown among the sheep , that shall be counted stolen with me .
and he departed , and began to publish in decapolis how great things jesus had done for him : and all men did marvel .
and samuel said to saul , thou hast done foolishly : thou hast not kept the commandment of the lord thy god , which he commanded thee : for now would the lord have established thy kingdom upon israel for ever .
i will pass through all thy flock to day , removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle , and all the brown cattle among the sheep , and the spotted and speckled among the goats : and of such shall be my hire .
and when he was come in , he saith unto them , why make ye this ado , and weep ? the damsel is not dead , but sleepeth .
and he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue , and seeth the tumult , and them that wept and wailed greatly .
and he suffered no man to follow him , save peter , and james , and john the brother of james .
as soon as jesus heard the word that was spoken , he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue , be not afraid , only believe .
and jacob did separate the lambs , and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked , and all the brown in the flock of laban ; and he put his own flocks by themselves , and put them not unto laban ' s cattle .
while he yet spake , there came from the ruler of the synagogue ' s house certain which said , thy daughter is dead : why troublest thou the master any further ?
and he said unto her , daughter , thy faith hath made thee whole ; go in peace , and be whole of thy plague .
but the woman fearing and trembling , knowing what was done in her , came and fell down before him , and told him all the truth .
and he looked round about to see her that had done this thing .
and his disciples said unto him , thou seest the multitude thronging thee , and sayest thou , who touched me ?
and the man increased exceedingly , and had much cattle , and maidservants , and menservants , and camels , and asses .
and jesus , immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him , turned him about in the press , and said , who touched my clothes ?
but when the cattle were feeble , he put them not in : so the feebler were laban ' s , and the stronger jacob ' s .
and it came to pass , whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive , that jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters , that they might conceive among the rods .
and he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the lord ; the fat that covereth the inwards , and all the fat that is upon the inwards ,
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering , and kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation : and aaron ' s sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about .
and if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering , if he offer it of the herd ; whether it be a male or female , he shall offer it without blemish before the lord .
if he offer a lamb for his offering , then shall he offer it before the lord .
and if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto the lord be of the flock ; male or female , he shall offer it without blemish .
and aaron ' s sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt sacrifice , which is upon the wood that is on the fire : it is an offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the lord .
and the two kidneys , and the fat that is on them , which is by the flanks , and the caul above the liver , with the kidneys , it shall he take away .
if any man have an ear , let him hear .
and there were voices , and thunders , and lightnings ; and there was a great earthquake , such as was not since men were upon the earth , so mighty an earthquake , and so great .
and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against god , to blaspheme his name , and his tabernacle , and them that dwell in heaven .
and the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air ; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven , from the throne , saying , it is done .
and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies ; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months .
and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him , whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world .
and the great city was divided into three parts , and the cities of the nations fell : and great babylon came in remembrance before god , to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath .
and it was given unto him to make war with the saints , and to overcome them : and power was given him over all kindreds , and tongues , and nations .
for they are the spirits of devils , working miracles , which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world , to gather them to the battle of that great day of god almighty .
lay hands suddenly on no man , neither be partaker of other men ' s sins : keep thyself pure .
and i saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon , and out of the mouth of the beast , and out of the mouth of the false prophet .
i charge thee before god , and the lord jesus christ , and the elect angels , that thou observe these things without preferring one before another , doing nothing by partiality .
and he gathered them together into a place called in the hebrew tongue armageddon .
some men ' s sins are open beforehand , going before to judgment ; and some men they follow after .
behold , i come as a thief . blessed is he that watcheth , and keepeth his garments , lest he walk naked , and they see his shame .
drink no longer water , but use a little wine for thy stomach ' s sake and thine often infirmities .
and the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast ; and his kingdom was full of darkness ; and they gnawed their tongues for pain ,
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering , and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation : and aaron ' s sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof round about upon the altar .
and he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the lord ; the fat thereof , and the whole rump , it shall he take off hard by the backbone ; and the fat that covereth the inwards , and all the fat that is upon the inwards ,
at the commandment of the lord they rested in the tents , and at the commandment of the lord they journeyed : they kept the charge of the lord , at the commandment of the lord by the hand of moses .
and the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river euphrates ; and the water thereof was dried up , that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared .
them that sin rebuke before all , that others also may fear .
or whether it were two days , or a month , or a year , that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle , remaining thereon , the children of israel abode in their tents , and journeyed not : but when it was taken up , they journeyed .
and blasphemed the god of heaven because of their pains and their sores , and repented not of their deeds .
and so it was , when the cloud abode from even unto the morning , and that the cloud was taken up in the morning , then they journeyed : whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up , they journeyed .
likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand ; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid .
and withal they learn to be idle , wandering about from house to house ; and not only idle , but tattlers also and busybodies , speaking things which they ought not .
and on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle , namely , the tent of the testimony : and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire , until the morning .
having damnation , because they have cast off their first faith .
and if a stranger shall sojourn among you , and will keep the passover unto the lord ; according to the ordinance of the passover , and according to the manner thereof , so shall he do : ye shall have one ordinance , both for the stranger , and for him that was born in the land .
but the younger widows refuse : for when they have begun to wax wanton against christ , they will marry ;
and when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle , then after that the children of israel journeyed : and in the place where the cloud abode , there the children of israel pitched their tents .
well reported of for good works ; if she have brought up children , if she have lodged strangers , if she have washed the saints ' feet , if she have relieved the afflicted , if she have diligently followed every good work .
so it was alway : the cloud covered it by day , and the appearance of fire by night .
the fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it , and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs .
speak unto the children of israel , saying , if any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body , or be in a journey afar off , yet he shall keep the passover unto the lord .
and there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven , every stone about the weight of a talent : and men blasphemed god because of the plague of the hail ; for the plague thereof was exceeding great .
but the man that is clean , and is not in a journey , and forbeareth to keep the passover , even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people : because he brought not the offering of the lord in his appointed season , that man shall bear his sin .
for the scripture saith , thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn . and , the labourer is worthy of his reward .
against an elder receive not an accusation , but before two or three witnesses .
if any man or woman that believeth have widows , let them relieve them , and let not the church be charged ; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed .
at the commandment of the lord the children of israel journeyed , and at the commandment of the lord they pitched : as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents .
let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour , especially they who labour in the word and doctrine .
and when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days , then the children of israel kept the charge of the lord , and journeyed not .
i will therefore that the younger women marry , bear children , guide the house , give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully .
for some are already turned aside after satan .
and the woman made haste , and ran , and shewed her husband , and said unto him , behold , the man hath appeared unto me , that came unto me the other day .
and manoah arose , and went after his wife , and came to the man , and said unto him , art thou the man that spakest unto the woman ? and he said , i am .
now when ezra had prayed , and when he had confessed , weeping and casting himself down before the house of god , there assembled unto him out of israel a very great congregation of men and women and children : for the people wept very sore .
in that day , saith the lord of hosts , will i take thee , o zerubbabel , my servant , the son of shealtiel , saith the lord , and will make thee as a signet : for i have chosen thee , saith the lord of hosts .
behold , the lord maketh the earth empty , and maketh it waste , and turneth it upside down , and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof .
the earth mourneth and fadeth away , the world languisheth and fadeth away , the haughty people of the earth do languish .
the land shall be utterly emptied , and utterly spoiled : for the lord hath spoken this word .
therefore hath the curse devoured the earth , and they that dwell therein are desolate : therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned , and few men left .
and again the word of the lord came unto haggai in the four and twentieth day of the month , saying ,
the earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof ; because they have transgressed the laws , changed the ordinance , broken the everlasting covenant .
speak to zerubbabel , governor of judah , saying , i will shake the heavens and the earth ;
the mirth of tabrets ceaseth , the noise of them that rejoice endeth , the joy of the harp ceaseth .
the new wine mourneth , the vine languisheth , all the merryhearted do sigh .
they shall not drink wine with a song ; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it .
and shechaniah the son of jehiel , one of the sons of elam , answered and said unto ezra , we have trespassed against our god , and have taken strange wives of the people of the land : yet now there is hope in israel concerning this thing .
he hath fenced up my way that i cannot pass , and he hath set darkness in my paths .
now therefore let us make a covenant with our god to put away all the wives , and such as are born of them , according to the counsel of my lord , and of those that tremble at the commandment of our god ; and let it be done according to the law .
behold , i cry out of wrong , but i am not heard : i cry aloud , but there is no judgment .
arise ; for this matter belongeth unto thee : we also will be with thee : be of good courage , and do it .
know now that god hath overthrown me , and hath compassed me with his net .
then arose ezra , and made the chief priests , the levites , and all israel , to swear that they should do according to this word . and they sware .
if indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me , and plead against me my reproach :
then ezra rose up from before the house of god , and went into the chamber of johanan the son of eliashib : and when he came thither , he did eat no bread , nor drink water : for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away .
and be it indeed that i have erred , mine error remaineth with myself .
and they made proclamation throughout judah and jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity , that they should gather themselves together unto jerusalem ;
these ten times have ye reproached me : ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me .
and that whosoever would not come within three days , according to the counsel of the princes and the elders , all his substance should be forfeited , and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away .
how long will ye vex my soul , and break me in pieces with words ?
then all the men of judah and benjamin gathered themselves together unto jerusalem within three days . it was the ninth month , on the twentieth day of the month ; and all the people sat in the street of the house of god , trembling because of this matter , and for the great rain .
then job answered and said ,
he hath stripped me of my glory , and taken the crown from my head .
but jesus called them to him , and saith unto them , ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the gentiles exercise lordship over them ; and their great ones exercise authority upon them .
and when the ten heard it , they began to be much displeased with james and john .
and whosoever of you will be the chiefest , shall be servant of all .
but so shall it not be among you : but whosoever will be great among you , shall be your minister :
and they came to jericho : and as he went out of jericho with his disciples and a great number of people , blind bartimaeus , the son of timaeus , sat by the highway side begging .
for even the son of man came not to be ministered unto , but to minister , and to give his life a ransom for many .
and many charged him that he should hold his peace : but he cried the more a great deal , thou son of david , have mercy on me .
and when he heard that it was jesus of nazareth , he began to cry out , and say , jesus , thou son of david , have mercy on me .
now therefore the wheat , and the barley , the oil , and the wine , which my lord hath spoken of , let him send unto his servants :
and jesus stood still , and commanded him to be called . and they call the blind man , saying unto him , be of good comfort , rise ; he calleth thee .
and now i have sent a cunning man , endued with understanding , of huram my father ' s ,
huram said moreover , blessed be the lord god of israel , that made heaven and earth , who hath given to david the king a wise son , endued with prudence and understanding , that might build an house for the lord , and an house for his kingdom .
and he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of burdens , and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountain , and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a work .
and solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of israel , after the numbering wherewith david his father had numbered them ; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred .
and we will cut wood out of lebanon , as much as thou shalt need : and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to joppa ; and thou shall carry it up to jerusalem .
but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give ; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared .
saying , behold , we go up to jerusalem ; and the son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests , and unto the scribes ; and they shall condemn him to death , and shall deliver him to the gentiles :
and they were in the way going up to jerusalem ; and jesus went before them : and they were amazed ; and as they followed , they were afraid . and he took again the twelve , and began to tell them what things should happen unto him ,
save me , o god ; for the waters are come in unto my soul .
but he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time , houses , and brethren , and sisters , and mothers , and children , and lands , with persecutions ; and in the world to come eternal life .
i sink in deep mire , where there is no standing : i am come into deep waters , where the floods overflow me .
they said unto him , grant unto us that we may sit , one on thy right hand , and the other on thy left hand , in thy glory .
i am weary of my crying : my throat is dried : mine eyes fail while i wait for my god .
and he said unto them , what would ye that i should do for you ?
and james and john , the sons of zebedee , come unto him , saying , master , we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire .
o god , thou knowest my foolishness ; and my sins are not hid from thee .
and they shall mock him , and shall scourge him , and shall spit upon him , and shall kill him : and the third day he shall rise again .
let not them that wait on thee , o lord god of hosts , be ashamed for my sake : let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake , o god of israel .
because for thy sake i have borne reproach ; shame hath covered my face .
i am become a stranger unto my brethren , and an alien unto my mother ' s children .
and they said unto him , we can . and jesus said unto them , ye shall indeed drink of the cup that i drink of ; and with the baptism that i am baptized withal shall ye be baptized :
for the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up ; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me .
but jesus said unto them , ye know not what ye ask : can ye drink of the cup that i drink of ? and be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with ?
as sorrowful , yet alway rejoicing ; as poor , yet making many rich ; as having nothing , and yet possessing all things .
be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers : for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness ? and what communion hath light with darkness ?
now for a recompence in the same , ( i speak as unto my children , ) be ye also enlarged .
ye are not straitened in us , but ye are straitened in your own bowels .
and , behold , i will give to thy servants , the hewers that cut timber , twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat , and twenty thousand measures of barley , and twenty thousand baths of wine , and twenty thousand baths of oil .
o ye corinthians , our mouth is open unto you , our heart is enlarged .
then huram the king of tyre answered in writing , which he sent to solomon , because the lord hath loved his people , he hath made thee king over them .
and will be a father unto you , and ye shall be my sons and daughters , saith the lord almighty .
wherefore come out from among them , and be ye separate , saith the lord , and touch not the unclean thing ; and i will receive you ,
and what agreement hath the temple of god with idols ? for ye are the temple of the living god ; as god hath said , i will dwell in them , and walk in them ; and i will be their god , and they shall be my people .
and what concord hath christ with belial ? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel ?
and the disciples were astonished at his words . but jesus answereth again , and saith unto them , children , how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of god !
and jesus looked round about , and saith unto his disciples , how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god !
and they were astonished out of measure , saying among themselves , who then can be saved ?
it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god .
and he answered and said unto him , master , all these have i observed from my youth .
and he was sad at that saying , and went away grieved : for he had great possessions .
then jesus beholding him loved him , and said unto him , one thing thou lackest : go thy way , sell whatsoever thou hast , and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come , take up the cross , and follow me .
then peter began to say unto him , lo , we have left all , and have followed thee .
and jesus looking upon them saith , with men it is impossible , but not with god : for with god all things are possible .
verily i say unto you , whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child , he shall not enter therein .
but when jesus saw it , he was much displeased , and said unto them , suffer the little children to come unto me , and forbid them not : for of such is the kingdom of god .
and they brought young children to him , that he should touch them : and his disciples rebuked those that brought them .
and if a woman shall put away her husband , and be married to another , she committeth adultery .
and he saith unto them , whosoever shall put away his wife , and marry another , committeth adultery against her .
and in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter .
thou knowest the commandments , do not commit adultery , do not kill , do not steal , do not bear false witness , defraud not , honour thy father and mother .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord , after the abominations of the heathen , whom the lord cast out before the children of israel .
and jesus said unto him , why callest thou me good ? there is none good but one , that is , god .
manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign , and reigned fifty and five years in jerusalem . and his mother ' s name was hephzi - bah .
and when he was gone forth into the way , there came one running , and kneeled to him , and asked him , good master , what shall i do that i may inherit eternal life ?
and he built altars in the house of the lord , of which the lord said , in jerusalem will i put my name .
and he took them up in his arms , put his hands upon them , and blessed them .
for he built up again the high places which hezekiah his father had destroyed ; and he reared up altars for baal , and made a grove , as did ahab king of israel ; and worshipped all the host of heaven , and served them .
and he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the lord .
and he made his son pass through the fire , and observed times , and used enchantments , and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards : he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the lord , to provoke him to anger .
and he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house , of which the lord said to david , and to solomon his son , in this house , and in jerusalem , which i have chosen out of all tribes of israel , will i put my name for ever :
neither will i make the feet of israel move any more out of the land which i gave their fathers ; only if they will observe to do according to all that i have commanded them , and according to all the law that my servant moses commanded them .
but they hearkened not : and manasseh seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the lord destroyed before the children of israel .
and the beast which i saw was like unto a leopard , and his feet were as the feet of a bear , and his mouth as the mouth of a lion : and the dragon gave him his power , and his seat , and great authority .
and i stood upon the sand of the sea , and saw a beast rise up out of the sea , having seven heads and ten horns , and upon his horns ten crowns , and upon his heads the name of blasphemy .
and they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast : and they worshipped the beast , saying , who is like unto the beast ? who is able to make war with him ?
and i saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death ; and his deadly wound was healed : and all the world wondered after the beast .
and judah took a wife for er his firstborn , whose name was tamar .
and she yet again conceived , and bare a son ; and called his name shelah : and he was at chezib , when she bare him .
and she conceived again , and bare a son ; and she called his name onan .
and she conceived , and bare a son ; and he called his name er .
and judah saw there a daughter of a certain canaanite , whose name was shuah ; and he took her , and went in unto her .
and it came to pass at that time , that judah went down from his brethren , and turned in to a certain adullamite , whose name was hirah .
and onan knew that the seed should not be his ; and it came to pass , when he went in unto his brother ' s wife , that he spilled it on the ground , lest that he should give seed to his brother .
and judah said unto onan , go in unto thy brother ' s wife , and marry her , and raise up seed to thy brother .
and er , judah ' s firstborn , was wicked in the sight of the lord ; and the lord slew him .
jeremiah the tenth , machbanai the eleventh .
attai the sixth , eliel the seventh ,
mishmannah the fourth , jeremiah the fifth ,
and there came of the children of benjamin and judah to the hold unto david .
these are they that went over jordan in the first month , when it had overflown all his banks ; and they put to flight all them of the valleys , both toward the east , and toward the west .
these were of the sons of gad , captains of the host : one of the least was over an hundred , and the greatest over a thousand .
and there fell some of manasseh to david , when he came with the philistines against saul to battle : but they helped them not : for the lords of the philistines upon advisement sent him away , saying , he will fall to his master saul to the jeopardy of our heads .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven : they pursued us upon the mountains , they laid wait for us in the wilderness .
speak unto the children of israel , saying , if a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the lord concerning things which ought not to be done , and shall do against any of them :
if the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people ; then let him bring for his sin , which he hath sinned , a young bullock without blemish unto the lord for a sin offering .
go and proclaim these words toward the north , and say , return , thou backsliding israel , saith the lord ; and i will not cause mine anger to fall upon you : for i am merciful , saith the lord , and i will not keep anger for ever .
as for us , our eyes as yet failed for our vain help : in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us .
and he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the lord ; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock ' s head , and kill the bullock before the lord .
and the lord said unto me , the backsliding israel hath justified herself more than treacherous judah .
they hunt our steps , that we cannot go in our streets : our end is near , our days are fulfilled ; for our end is come .
and the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock ' s blood , and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation :
and yet for all this her treacherous sister judah hath not turned unto me with her whole heart , but feignedly , saith the lord .
they cried unto them , depart ye ; it is unclean ; depart , depart , touch not : when they fled away and wandered , they said among the heathen , they shall no more sojourn there .
and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood , and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the lord , before the vail of the sanctuary .
the anger of the lord hath divided them ; he will no more regard them : they respected not the persons of the priests , they favoured not the elders .
the punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished , o daughter of zion ; he will no more carry thee away into captivity : he will visit thine iniquity , o daughter of edom ; he will discover thy sins .
rejoice and be glad , o daughter of edom , that dwellest in the land of uz ; the cup also shall pass through unto thee : thou shalt be drunken , and shalt make thyself naked .
but put ye on the lord jesus christ , and make not provision for the flesh , to fulfil the lusts thereof .
let us walk honestly , as in the day ; not in rioting and drunkenness , not in chambering and wantonness , not in strife and envying .
the night is far spent , the day is at hand : let us therefore cast off the works of darkness , and let us put on the armour of light .
and that , knowing the time , that now it is high time to awake out of sleep : for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed .
love worketh no ill to his neighbour : therefore love is the fulfilling of the law .
a voice was heard upon the high places , weeping and supplications of the children of israel : for they have perverted their way , and they have forgotten the lord their god .
surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband , so have ye dealt treacherously with me , o house of israel , saith the lord .
and jesus said unto him , go thy way ; thy faith hath made thee whole . and immediately he received his sight , and followed jesus in the way .
truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills , and from the multitude of mountains : truly in the lord our god is the salvation of israel .
return , ye backsliding children , and i will heal your backslidings . behold , we come unto thee ; for thou art the lord our god .
and jesus answered and said unto him , what wilt thou that i should do unto thee ? the blind man said unto him , lord , that i might receive my sight .
only acknowledge thine iniquity , that thou hast transgressed against the lord thy god , and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree , and ye have not obeyed my voice , saith the lord .
the kings of the earth , and all the inhabitants of the world , would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of jerusalem .
and he , casting away his garment , rose , and came to jesus .
turn , o backsliding children , saith the lord ; for i am married unto you : and i will take you one of a city , and two of a family , and i will bring you to zion :
the lord hath accomplished his fury ; he hath poured out his fierce anger , and hath kindled a fire in zion , and it hath devoured the foundations thereof .
and i will give you pastors according to mine heart , which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding .
they have wandered as blind men in the streets , they have polluted themselves with blood , so that men could not touch their garments .
for the sins of her prophets , and the iniquities of her priests , that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her ,
at that time they shall call jerusalem the throne of the lord ; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it , to the name of the lord , to jerusalem : neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their evil heart .
in those days the house of judah shall walk with the house of israel , and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that i have given for an inheritance unto your fathers .
but i said , how shall i put thee among the children , and give thee a pleasant land , a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations ? and i said , thou shalt call me , my father ; and shalt not turn away from me .
the hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children : they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people .
for i know not to give flattering titles ; in so doing my maker would soon take me away .
i will speak , that i may be refreshed : i will open my lips and answer .
let me not , i pray you , accept any man ' s person , neither let me give flattering titles unto man .
wisdom is the principal thing ; therefore get wisdom : and with all thy getting get understanding .
exalt her , and she shall promote thee : she shall bring thee to honour , when thou dost embrace her .
for shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth ; their flocks and their herds , their sons and their daughters .
she shall give to thine head an ornament of grace : a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee .
he taught me also , and said unto me , let thine heart retain my words : keep my commandments , and live .
for i was my father ' s son , tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother .
forsake her not , and she shall preserve thee : love her , and she shall keep thee .
get wisdom , get understanding : forget it not ; neither decline from the words of my mouth .
whereby the world that then was , being overflowed with water , perished :
but the heavens and the earth , which are now , by the same word are kept in store , reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men .
but , beloved , be not ignorant of this one thing , that one day is with the lord as a thousand years , and a thousand years as one day .
the lord is not slack concerning his promise , as some men count slackness ; but is longsuffering to us - ward , not willing that any should perish , but that all should come to repentance .
hear , ye children , the instruction of a father , and attend to know understanding .
that ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets , and of the commandment of us the apostles of the lord and saviour :
knowing this first , that there shall come in the last days scoffers , walking after their own lusts ,
and saying , where is the promise of his coming ? for since the fathers fell asleep , all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation .
for this they willingly are ignorant of , that by the word of god the heavens were of old , and the earth standing out of the water and in the water :
this second epistle , beloved , i now write unto you ; in both which i stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance :
they bear him upon the shoulder , they carry him , and set him in his place , and he standeth ; from his place shall he not remove : yea , one shall cry unto him , yet can he not answer , nor save him out of his trouble .
remember this , and shew yourselves men : bring it again to mind , o ye transgressors .
to whom will ye liken me , and make me equal , and compare me , that we may be like ?
they lavish gold out of the bag , and weigh silver in the balance , and hire a goldsmith ; and he maketh it a god : they fall down , yea , they worship .
hearken unto me , o house of jacob , and all the remnant of the house of israel , which are borne by me from the belly , which are carried from the womb :
and even to your old age i am he ; and even to hoar hairs will i carry you : i have made , and i will bear ; even i will carry , and will deliver you .
bel boweth down , nebo stoopeth , their idols were upon the beasts , and upon the cattle : your carriages were heavy loaden ; they are a burden to the weary beast .
and of the children of benjamin , the kindred of saul , three thousand : for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the ward of the house of saul .
they stoop , they bow down together ; they could not deliver the burden , but themselves are gone into captivity .
as he went to ziklag , there fell to him of manasseh , adnah , and jozabad , and jediael , and michael , and jozabad , and elihu , and zilthai , captains of the thousands that were of manasseh .
and jehoiada was the leader of the aaronites , and with him were three thousand and seven hundred ;
and zadok , a young man mighty of valour , and of his father ' s house twenty and two captains .
of the children of simeon , mighty men of valour for the war , seven thousand and one hundred .
of the children of levi four thousand and six hundred .
and these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to the war , and came to david to hebron , to turn the kingdom of saul to him , according to the word of the lord .
the children of judah that bare shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred , ready armed to the war .
and they helped david against the band of the rovers : for they were all mighty men of valour , and were captains in the host .
for at that time day by day there came to david to help him , until it was a great host , like the host of god .
remember the former things of old : for i am god , and there is none else ; i am god , and there is none like me ,
and of the children of ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred , mighty men of valour , famous throughout the house of their fathers .
and of the half tribe of manasseh eighteen thousand , which were expressed by name , to come and make david king .
and of asher , such as went forth to battle , expert in war , forty thousand .
and on the other side of jordan , of the reubenites , and the gadites , and of the half tribe of manasseh , with all manner of instruments of war for the battle , an hundred and twenty thousand .
all these men of war , that could keep rank , came with a perfect heart to hebron , to make david king over all israel : and all the rest also of israel were of one heart to make david king .
and there they were with david three days , eating and drinking : for their brethren had prepared for them .
and of the children of issachar , which were men that had understanding of the times , to know what israel ought to do ; the heads of them were two hundred ; and all their brethren were at their commandment .
of zebulun , such as went forth to battle , expert in war , with all instruments of war , fifty thousand , which could keep rank : they were not of double heart .
and of naphtali a thousand captains , and with them with shield and spear thirty and seven thousand .
and of the danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and six hundred .
how was it then reckoned ? when he was in circumcision , or in uncircumcision ? not in circumcision , but in uncircumcision .
for the promise , that he should be the heir of the world , was not to abraham , or to his seed , through the law , but through the righteousness of faith .
for if they which are of the law be heirs , faith is made void , and the promise made of none effect :
and he received the sign of circumcision , a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised : that he might be the father of all them that believe , though they be not circumcised ; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also :
and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only , but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father abraham , which he had being yet uncircumcised .
( as it is written , i have made thee a father of many nations , ) before him whom he believed , even god , who quickeneth the dead , and calleth those things which be not as though they were .
who against hope believed in hope , that he might become the father of many nations ; according to that which was spoken , so shall thy seed be .
because the law worketh wrath : for where no law is , there is no transgression .
therefore it is of faith , that it might be by grace ; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed ; not to that only which is of the law , but to that also which is of the faith of abraham ; who is the father of us all ,
and being not weak in faith , he considered not his own body now dead , when he was about an hundred years old , neither yet the deadness of sara ' s womb :
and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness .
hear ye , o mountains , the lord ' s controversy , and ye strong foundations of the earth : for the lord hath a controversy with his people , and he will plead with israel .
now it was not written for his sake alone , that it was imputed to him ;
and the word of the lord came unto me , saying ,
hear ye now what the lord saith ; arise , contend thou before the mountains , and let the hills hear thy voice .
but for us also , to whom it shall be imputed , if we believe on him that raised up jesus our lord from the dead ;
who was delivered for our offences , and was raised again for our justification .
he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief ; but was strong in faith , giving glory to god ;
and being fully persuaded that , what he had promised , he was able also to perform .
the lord ' s voice crieth unto the city , and the man of wisdom shall see thy name : hear ye the rod , and who hath appointed it .
he hath shewed thee , o man , what is good ; and what doth the lord require of thee , but to do justly , and to love mercy , and to walk humbly with thy god ?
will the lord be pleased with thousands of rams , or with ten thousands of rivers of oil ? shall i give my firstborn for my transgression , the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul ?
wherewith shall i come before the lord , and bow myself before the high god ? shall i come before him with burnt offerings , with calves of a year old ?
o my people , remember now what balak king of moab consulted , and what balaam the son of beor answered him from shittim unto gilgal ; that ye may know the righteousness of the lord .
for i brought thee up out of the land of egypt , and redeemed thee out of the house of servants ; and i sent before thee moses , aaron , and miriam .
o my people , what have i done unto thee ? and wherein have i wearied thee ? testify against me .
therefore thus saith the lord god ; because ye have spoken vanity , and seen lies , therefore , behold , i am against you , saith the lord god .
have ye not seen a vain vision , and have ye not spoken a lying divination , whereas ye say , the lord saith it ; albeit i have not spoken ?
they have seen vanity and lying divination , saying , the lord saith : and the lord hath not sent them : and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word .
ye have not gone up into the gaps , neither made up the hedge for the house of israel to stand in the battle in the day of the lord .
o israel , thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts .
thus saith the lord god ; woe unto the foolish prophets , that follow their own spirit , and have seen nothing !
son of man , prophesy against the prophets of israel that prophesy , and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts , hear ye the word of the lord ;
these things have i spoken unto you , that ye should not be offended .
and it shall be , that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street , his blood shall be upon his head , and we will be guiltless : and whosoever shall be with thee in the house , his blood shall be on our head , if any hand be upon him .
and the sons of shimon were , amnon , and rinnah , ben - hanan , and tilon . and the sons of ishi were , zoheth , and ben - zoheth .
the sons of shelah the son of judah were , er the father of lecah , and laadah the father of mareshah , and the families of the house of them that wrought fine linen , of the house of ashbea ,
and jokim , and the men of chozeba , and joash , and saraph , who had the dominion in moab , and jashubi - lehem . and these are ancient things .
therefore , o ye shepherds , hear the word of the lord ;
therefore , ye shepherds , hear the word of the lord ;
as i live , saith the lord god , surely because my flock became a prey , and my flock became meat to every beast of the field , because there was no shepherd , neither did my shepherds search for my flock , but the shepherds fed themselves , and fed not my flock ;
and they were scattered , because there is no shepherd : and they became meat to all the beasts of the field , when they were scattered .
my sheep wandered through all the mountains , and upon every high hill : yea , my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth , and none did search or seek after them .
ye eat the fat , and ye clothe you with the wool , ye kill them that are fed : but ye feed not the flock .
the diseased have ye not strengthened , neither have ye healed that which was sick , neither have ye bound up that which was broken , neither have ye brought again that which was driven away , neither have ye sought that which was lost ; but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them .
son of man , prophesy against the shepherds of israel , prophesy , and say unto them , thus saith the lord god unto the shepherds ; woe be to the shepherds of israel that do feed themselves ! should not the shepherds feed the flocks ?
and the word of the lord came unto me , saying ,
for we have heard how the lord dried up the water of the red sea for you , when ye came out of egypt ; and what ye did unto the two kings of the amorites , that were on the other side jordan , sihon and og , whom ye utterly destroyed .
and meonothai begat ophrah : and seraiah begat joab , the father of the valley of charashim ; for they were craftsmen .
and as soon as we had heard these things , our hearts did melt , neither did there remain any more courage in any man , because of you : for the lord your god , he is god in heaven above , and in earth beneath .
now therefore , i pray you , swear unto me by the lord , since i have shewed you kindness , that ye will also shew kindness unto my father ' s house , and give me a true token :
and the sons of jehaleleel ; ziph , and ziphah , tiria , and asareel .
and that ye will save alive my father , and my mother , and my brethren , and my sisters , and all that they have , and deliver our lives from death .
and the sons of caleb the son of jephunneh ; iru , elah , and naam : and the sons of elah , even kenaz .
and the men answered her , our life for yours , if ye utter not this our business . and it shall be , when the lord hath given us the land , that we will deal kindly and truly with thee .
then she let them down by a cord through the window : for her house was upon the town wall , and she dwelt upon the wall .
and the sons of ezra were , jether , and mered , and epher , and jalon : and she bare miriam , and shammai , and ishbah the father of eshtemoa .
and she said unto them , get you to the mountain , lest the pursuers meet you ; and hide yourselves there three days , until the pursuers be returned : and afterward may ye go your way .
and the men said unto her , we will be blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear .
and the sons of his wife hodiah the sister of naham , the father of keilah the garmite , and eshtemoa the maachathite .
behold , when we come into the land , thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by : and thou shalt bring thy father , and thy mother , and thy brethren , and all thy father ' s household , home unto thee .
and at bethuel , and at hormah , and at ziklag ,
and all their villages that were round about the same cities , unto baal . these were their habitations , and their genealogy .
and meshobab , and jamlech , and joshah the son of amaziah ,
and at beth - marcaboth , and hazar - susim , and at beth - birei , and at shaaraim . these were their cities unto the reign of david .
and their villages were , etam , and ain , rimmon , and tochen , and ashan , five cities :
wherefore i perceive that there is nothing better , than that a man should rejoice in his own works ; for that is his portion : for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him ?
who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward , and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth ?
all go unto one place ; all are of the dust , and all turn to dust again .
the burden of tyre . howl , ye ships of tarshish ; for it is laid waste , so that there is no house , no entering in : from the land of chittim it is revealed to them .
but because i have said these things unto you , sorrow hath filled your heart .
and shimei had sixteen sons and six daughters ; but his brethren had not many children , neither did all their family multiply , like to the children of judah .
who hath taken this counsel against tyre , the crowning city , whose merchants are princes , whose traffickers are the honourable of the earth ?
and the sons of mishma ; hamuel his son , zachur his son , shimei his son .
the lord of hosts hath purposed it , to stain the pride of all glory , and to bring into contempt all the honourable of the earth .
and when he is come , he will reprove the world of sin , and of righteousness , and of judgment :
shallum his son , mibsam his son , mishma his son .
pass ye over to tarshish ; howl , ye inhabitants of the isle .
of sin , because they believe not on me ;
the sons of simeon were , nemuel , and jamin , jarib , zerah , and shaul :
is this your joyous city , whose antiquity is of ancient days ? her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn .
they shall put you out of the synagogues : yea , the time cometh , that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth god service .
and these things will they do unto you , because they have not known the father , nor me .
as at the report concerning egypt , so shall they be sorely pained at the report of tyre .
but these things have i told you , that when the time shall come , ye may remember that i told you of them . and these things i said not unto you at the beginning , because i was with you .
and at bilhah , and at ezem , and at tolad ,
be still , ye inhabitants of the isle ; thou whom the merchants of zidon , that pass over the sea , have replenished .
but now i go my way to him that sent me ; and none of you asketh me , whither goest thou ?
and they dwelt at beer - sheba , and moladah , and hazar - shual ,
and by great waters the seed of sihor , the harvest of the river , is her revenue ; and she is a mart of nations .
for that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts ; even one thing befalleth them : as the one dieth , so dieth the other ; yea , they have all one breath ; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast : for all is vanity .
night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face , and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith ?
finally , brethren , whatsoever things are true , whatsoever things are honest , whatsoever things are just , whatsoever things are pure , whatsoever things are lovely , whatsoever things are of good report ; if there be any virtue , and if there be any praise , think on these things .
he hath made every thing beautiful in his time : also he hath set the world in their heart , so that no man can find out the work that god maketh from the beginning to the end .
and the peace of god , which passeth all understanding , shall keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus .
i know that there is no good in them , but for a man to rejoice , and to do good in his life .
and also that every man should eat and drink , and enjoy the good of all his labour , it is the gift of god .
those things , which ye have both learned , and received , and heard , and seen in me , do : and the god of peace shall be with you .
rejoice in the lord alway : and again i say , rejoice .
and i intreat thee also , true yokefellow , help those women which laboured with me in the gospel , with clement also , and with other my fellowlabourers , whose names are in the book of life .
and moreover i saw under the sun the place of judgment , that wickedness was there ; and the place of righteousness , that iniquity was there .
be careful for nothing ; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto god .
i said in mine heart , god shall judge the righteous and the wicked : for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work .
let your moderation be known unto all men . the lord is at hand .
i said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men , that god might manifest them , and that they might see that they themselves are beasts .
therefore , my brethren dearly beloved and longed for , my joy and crown , so stand fast in the lord , my dearly beloved .
i beseech euodias , and beseech syntyche , that they be of the same mind in the lord .
and herod was highly displeased with them of tyre and sidon : but they came with one accord to him , and , having made blastus the king ' s chamberlain their friend , desired peace ; because their country was nourished by the king ' s country .
and upon a set day herod , arrayed in royal apparel , sat upon his throne , and made an oration unto them .
and the people gave a shout , saying , it is the voice of a god , and not of a man .
and immediately the angel of the lord smote him , because he gave not god the glory : and he was eaten of worms , and gave up the ghost .
i have seen the travail , which god hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it .
but the word of god grew and multiplied .
and barnabas and saul returned from jerusalem , when they had fulfilled their ministry , and took with them john , whose surname was mark .
and the lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another , and toward all men , even as we do toward you :
now god himself and our father , and our lord jesus christ , direct our way unto you .
to the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before god , even our father , at the coming of our lord jesus christ with all his saints .
and chelub the brother of shuah begat mehir , which was the father of eshton .
and eshton begat beth - rapha , and paseah , and tehinnah the father of ir - nahash . these are the men of rechah .
and jabez called on the god of israel , saying , oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed , and enlarge my coast , and that thine hand might be with me , and that thou wouldest keep me from evil , that it may not grieve me ! and god granted him that which he requested .
and if thou utter this our business , then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear .
and she said , according unto your words , so be it . and she sent them away , and they departed : and she bound the scarlet line in the window .
and when he had considered the thing , he came to the house of mary the mother of john , whose surname was mark ; where many were gathered together praying .
and as peter knocked at the door of the gate , a damsel came to hearken , named rhoda .
when they were past the first and the second ward , they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city ; which opened to them of his own accord : and they went out , and passed on through one street ; and forthwith the angel departed from him .
but peter continued knocking : and when they had opened the door , and saw him , they were astonished .
but he , beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace , declared unto them how the lord had brought him out of the prison . and he said , go shew these things unto james , and to the brethren . and he departed , and went into another place .
and when she knew peter ' s voice , she opened not the gate for gladness , but ran in , and told how peter stood before the gate .
and they said unto her , thou art mad . but she constantly affirmed that it was even so . then said they , it is his angel .
and they said unto joshua , truly the lord hath delivered into our hands all the land ; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us .
now as soon as it was day , there was no small stir among the soldiers , what was become of peter .
and they went , and came unto the mountain , and abode there three days , until the pursuers were returned : and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way , but found them not .
and when herod had sought for him , and found him not , he examined the keepers , and commanded that they should be put to death . and he went down from judaea to caesarea , and there abode .
so the two men returned , and descended from the mountain , and passed over , and came to joshua the son of nun , and told him all things that befell them :
and when the servants of hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before israel , they made peace with david , and became his servants : neither would the syrians help the children of ammon any more .
but the syrians fled before israel ; and david slew of the syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots , and forty thousand footmen , and killed shophach the captain of the host .
be of good courage , and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people , and for the cities of our god : and let the lord do that which is good in his sight .
and he said , if the syrians be too strong for me , then thou shalt help me : but if the children of ammon be too strong for thee , then i will help thee .
and the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of abishai his brother , and they set themselves in array against the children of ammon .
and it was told david ; and he gathered all israel , and passed over jordan , and came upon them , and set the battle in array against them . so when david had put the battle in array against the syrians , they fought with him .
and when the syrians saw that they were put to the worse before israel , they sent messengers , and drew forth the syrians that were beyond the river : and shophach the captain of the host of hadarezer went before them .
and when the children of ammon saw that the syrians were fled , they likewise fled before abishai his brother , and entered into the city . then joab came to jerusalem .
so joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the syrians unto the battle ; and they fled before him .
moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twined linen , and blue , and purple , and scarlet : with cherubims of cunning work shalt thou make them .
the length of one curtain shall be eight and twenty cubits , and the breadth of one curtain four cubits : and every one of the curtains shall have one measure .
the five curtains shall be coupled together one to another ; and other five curtains shall be coupled one to another .
fifty loops shalt thou make in the one curtain , and fifty loops shalt thou make in the edge of the curtain that is in the coupling of the second ; that the loops may take hold one of another .
and thou shalt make fifty taches of gold , and couple the curtains together with the taches : and it shall be one tabernacle .
and thou shalt make curtains of goats ' hair to be a covering upon the tabernacle : eleven curtains shalt thou make .
the length of one curtain shall be thirty cubits , and the breadth of one curtain four cubits : and the eleven curtains shall be all of one measure .
and thou shalt couple five curtains by themselves , and six curtains by themselves , and shalt double the sixth curtain in the forefront of the tabernacle .
and we dreamed a dream in one night , i and he ; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream .
pharaoh was wroth with his servants , and put me in ward in the captain of the guard ' s house , both me and the chief baker :
and joseph answered pharaoh , saying , it is not in me : god shall give pharaoh an answer of peace .
and , behold , seven other kine came up after them , poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed , such as i never saw in all the land of egypt for badness :
and , behold , there came up out of the river seven kine , fatfleshed and well favoured ; and they fed in a meadow :
and it came to pass , as he interpreted to us , so it was ; me he restored unto mine office , and him he hanged .
and there was there with us a young man , an hebrew , servant to the captain of the guard ; and we told him , and he interpreted to us our dreams ; to each man according to his dream he did interpret .
and pharaoh said unto joseph , i have dreamed a dream , and there is none that can interpret it : and i have heard say of thee , that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it .
then pharaoh sent and called joseph , and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon : and he shaved himself , and changed his raiment , and came in unto pharaoh .
and thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these things unto the lord : and when it is presented unto the priest , he shall bring it unto the altar .
and if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in the fryingpan , it shall be made of fine flour with oil .
thou shalt part it in pieces , and pour oil thereon : it is a meat offering .
and if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in a pan , it shall be of fine flour unleavened , mingled with oil .
and if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the oven , it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil , or unleavened wafers anointed with oil .
and the remnant of the meat offering shall be aaron ' s and his sons ' : it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the lord made by fire .
and when any will offer a meat offering unto the lord , his offering shall be of fine flour ; and he shall pour oil upon it , and put frankincense thereon :
and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before the lord for his sin which he hath done : and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him .
and he shall bring his trespass offering unto the lord , unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , even a ram for a trespass offering .
but in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the lord withal .
and when ye shall come into the land , and shall have planted all manner of trees for food , then ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised : three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you : it shall not be eaten of .
ye shall not eat any thing with the blood : neither shall ye use enchantment , nor observe times .
and in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof , that it may yield unto you the increase thereof : i am the lord your god .
ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead , nor print any marks upon you : i am the lord .
ye shall not round the corners of your heads , neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard .
and whosoever lieth carnally with a woman , that is a bondmaid , betrothed to an husband , and not at all redeemed , nor freedom given her ; she shall be scourged ; they shall not be put to death , because she was not free .
do not prostitute thy daughter , to cause her to be a whore ; lest the land fall to whoredom , and the land become full of wickedness .
ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment , in meteyard , in weight , or in measure .
but the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you , and thou shalt love him as thyself ; for ye were strangers in the land of egypt : i am the lord your god .
and if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land , ye shall not vex him .
thou shalt rise up before the hoary head , and honour the face of the old man , and fear thy god : i am the lord .
therefore shall ye observe all my statutes , and all my judgments , and do them : i am the lord .
just balances , just weights , a just ephah , and a just hin , shall ye have : i am the lord your god , which brought you out of the land of egypt .
ye shall keep my sabbaths , and reverence my sanctuary : i am the lord .
and the famine was over all the face of the earth : and joseph opened all the storehouses , and sold unto the egyptians ; and the famine waxed sore in the land of egypt .
and all countries came into egypt to joseph for to buy corn ; because that the famine was so sore in all lands .
and the name of the second called he ephraim : for god hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction .
and the seven years of plenteousness , that was in the land of egypt , were ended .
and the seven years of dearth began to come , according as joseph had said : and the dearth was in all lands ; but in all the land of egypt there was bread .
and when all the land of egypt was famished , the people cried to pharaoh for bread : and pharaoh said unto all the egyptians , go unto joseph ; what he saith to you , do .
and the men of judah said , why are ye come up against us ? and they answered , to bind samson are we come up , to do to him as he hath done to us .
then three thousand men of judah went to the top of the rock etam , and said to samson , knowest thou not that the philistines are rulers over us ? what is this that thou hast done unto us ? and he said unto them , as they did unto me , so have i done unto them .
and they said unto him , we are come down to bind thee , that we may deliver thee into the hand of the philistines . and samson said unto them , swear unto me , that ye will not fall upon me yourselves .
and unto joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came , which asenath the daughter of poti - pherah priest of on bare unto him .
and they spake unto him , saying , no ; but we will bind thee fast , and deliver thee into their hand : but surely we will not kill thee . and they bound him with two new cords , and brought him up from the rock .
and joseph called the name of the firstborn manasseh : for god , said he , hath made me forget all my toil , and all my father ' s house .
and joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea , very much , until he left numbering ; for it was without number .
and in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls .
and pharaoh called joseph ' s name zaphnath - paaneah ; and he gave him to wife asenath the daughter of poti - pherah priest of on . and joseph went out over all the land of egypt .
and joseph was thirty years old when he stood before pharaoh king of egypt . and joseph went out from the presence of pharaoh , and went throughout all the land of egypt .
and pharaoh said unto joseph , i am pharaoh , and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of egypt .
and pharaoh said unto joseph , see , i have set thee over all the land of egypt .
and pharaoh took off his ring from his hand , and put it upon joseph ' s hand , and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen , and put a gold chain about his neck ;
thou shalt be over my house , and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled : only in the throne will i be greater than thou .
let pharaoh do this , and let him appoint officers over the land , and take up the fifth part of the land of egypt in the seven plenteous years .
and let them gather all the food of those good years that come , and lay up corn under the hand of pharaoh , and let them keep food in the cities .
and they went to the entrance of gedor , even unto the east side of the valley , to seek pasture for their flocks .
and that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine , which shall be in the land of egypt ; that the land perish not through the famine .
and the thing was good in the eyes of pharaoh , and in the eyes of all his servants .
and ziza the son of shiphi , the son of allon , the son of jedaiah , the son of shimri , the son of shemaiah ;
and pharaoh said unto his servants , can we find such a one as this is , a man in whom the spirit of god is ?
these mentioned by their names were princes in their families : and the house of their fathers increased greatly .
and pharaoh said unto joseph , forasmuch as god hath shewed thee all this , there is none so discreet and wise as thou art :
and joel , and jehu the son of josibiah , the son of seraiah , the son of asiel ,
and elioenai , and jaakobah , and jeshohaiah , and asaiah , and adiel , and jesimiel , and benaiah ,
and the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial thereof , and shall burn it upon the altar : it is an offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the lord .
and there shall arise after them seven years of famine ; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of egypt ; and the famine shall consume the land ;
and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following ; for it shall be very grievous .
and for that the dream was doubled unto pharaoh twice ; it is because the thing is established by god , and god will shortly bring it to pass .
now therefore let pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise , and set him over the land of egypt .
and they smote the rest of the amalekites that were escaped , and dwelt there unto this day .
and some of them , even of the sons of simeon , five hundred men , went to mount seir , having for their captains pelatiah , and neariah , and rephaiah , and uzziel , the sons of ishi .
and these written by name came in the days of hezekiah king of judah , and smote their tents , and the habitations that were found there , and destroyed them utterly unto this day , and dwelt in their rooms : because there was pasture there for their flocks .
and they found fat pasture and good , and the land was wide , and quiet , and peaceable ; for they of ham had dwelt there of old .
the seven good kine are seven years ; and the seven good ears are seven years : the dream is one .
and , behold , seven ears , withered , thin , and blasted with the east wind , sprung up after them :
and the thin ears devoured the seven good ears : and i told this unto the magicians ; but there was none that could declare it to me .
behold , there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of egypt :
then answered bildad the shuhite , and said ,
and the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years ; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine .
this is the thing which i have spoken unto pharaoh : what god is about to do he sheweth unto pharaoh .
yea , the light of the wicked shall be put out , and the spark of his fire shall not shine .
he teareth himself in his anger : shall the earth be forsaken for thee ? and shall the rock be removed out of his place ?
wherefore are we counted as beasts , and reputed vile in your sight ?
how long will it be ere ye make an end of words ? mark , and afterwards we will speak .
and when they had eaten them up , it could not be known that they had eaten them ; but they were still ill favoured , as at the beginning . so i awoke .
the gin shall take him by the heel , and the robber shall prevail against him .
and i saw in my dream , and , behold , seven ears came up in one stalk , full and good :
for he is cast into a net by his own feet , and he walketh upon a snare .
the steps of his strength shall be straitened , and his own counsel shall cast him down .
and the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine :
the light shall be dark in his tabernacle , and his candle shall be put out with him .
but god clave an hollow place that was in the jaw , and there came water thereout ; and when he had drunk , his spirit came again , and he revived : wherefore he called the name thereof en - hakkore , which is in lehi unto this day .
and he was sore athirst , and called on the lord , and said , thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant : and now shall i die for thirst , and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised ?
and it came to pass , when he had made an end of speaking , that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand , and called that place ramath - lehi .
and samson said , with the jawbone of an ass , heaps upon heaps , with the jaw of an ass have i slain a thousand men .
and he found a new jawbone of an ass , and put forth his hand , and took it , and slew a thousand men therewith .
and when he came unto lehi , the philistines shouted against him : and the spirit of the lord came mightily upon him , and the cords that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire , and his bands loosed from off his hands .
the earth shook , the heavens also dropped at the presence of god : even sinai itself was moved at the presence of god , the god of israel .
thou , o god , didst send a plentiful rain , whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance , when it was weary .
sing unto god , sing praises to his name : extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name jah , and rejoice before him .
a father of the fatherless , and a judge of the widows , is god in his holy habitation .
god setteth the solitary in families : he bringeth out those which are bound with chains : but the rebellious dwell in a dry land .
o god , when thou wentest forth before thy people , when thou didst march through the wilderness ; selah :
let god arise , let his enemies be scattered : let them also that hate him flee before him .
as smoke is driven away , so drive them away : as wax melteth before the fire , so let the wicked perish at the presence of god .
but let the righteous be glad ; let them rejoice before god : yea , let them exceedingly rejoice .
i should have been as though i had not been ; i should have been carried from the womb to the grave .
thou renewest thy witnesses against me , and increasest thine indignation upon me ; changes and war are against me .
wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb ? oh that i had given up the ghost , and no eye had seen me !
if i be wicked , woe unto me ; and if i be righteous , yet will i not lift up my head . i am full of confusion ; therefore see thou mine affliction ;
for it increaseth . thou huntest me as a fierce lion : and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me .
and these things hast thou hid in thine heart : i know that this is with thee .
if i sin , then thou markest me , and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity .
thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh , and hast fenced me with bones and sinews .
thou hast granted me life and favour , and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit .
hast thou not poured me out as milk , and curdled me like cheese ?
while it is said , to day if ye will hear his voice , harden not your hearts , as in the provocation .
for some , when they had heard , did provoke : howbeit not all that came out of egypt by moses .
but with whom was he grieved forty years ? was it not with them that had sinned , whose carcases fell in the wilderness ?
and to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest , but to them that believed not ?
so i sware in my wrath , they shall not enter into my rest . )
take heed , brethren , lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief , in departing from the living god .
but exhort one another daily , while it is called to day ; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin .
for we are made partakers of christ , if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end ;
so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief .
before i go whence i shall not return , even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death ;
wherefore i was grieved with that generation , and said , they do alway err in their heart ; and they have not known my ways .
a land of darkness , as darkness itself ; and of the shadow of death , without any order , and where the light is as darkness .
and it waxed great , even to the host of heaven ; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground , and stamped upon them .
yea , he magnified himself even to the prince of the host , and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away , and the place of his sanctuary was cast down .
ye shall keep my statutes . thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind : thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed : neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee .
the lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations , and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished :
thou shalt not avenge , nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people , but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself : i am the lord .
( for that righteous man dwelling among them , in seeing and hearing , vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds ; )
and delivered just lot , vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked :
and many shall follow their pernicious ways ; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of .
but there were false prophets also among the people , even as there shall be false teachers among you , who privily shall bring in damnable heresies , even denying the lord that bought them , and bring upon themselves swift destruction .
and i looked , and , lo , a lamb stood on the mount sion , and with him an hundred forty and four thousand , having his father ' s name written in their foreheads .
and turning the cities of sodom and gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow , making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly ;
and spared not the old world , but saved noah the eighth person , a preacher of righteousness , bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly ;
and they sung as it were a new song before the throne , and before the four beasts , and the elders : and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand , which were redeemed from the earth .
for if god spared not the angels that sinned , but cast them down to hell , and delivered them into chains of darkness , to be reserved unto judgment ;
and i heard a voice from heaven , as the voice of many waters , and as the voice of a great thunder : and i heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps :
and through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you : whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not , and their damnation slumbereth not .
but he refused , and said unto his master ' s wife , behold , my master wotteth not what is with me in the house , and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand ;
and it came to pass after these things , that his master ' s wife cast her eyes upon joseph ; and she said , lie with me .
and he left all that he had in joseph ' s hand ; and he knew not ought he had , save the bread which he did eat . and joseph was a goodly person , and well favoured .
and joseph was brought down to egypt ; and potiphar , an officer of pharaoh , captain of the guard , an egyptian , bought him of the hands of the ishmeelites , which had brought him down thither .
and thou shalt not glean thy vineyard , neither shalt thou gather every grape of thy vineyard ; thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger : i am the lord your god .
ye shall not steal , neither deal falsely , neither lie one to another .
and ye shall not swear by my name falsely , neither shalt thou profane the name of thy god : i am the lord .
thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour , neither rob him : the wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the morning .
thou shalt not curse the deaf , nor put a stumblingblock before the blind , but shalt fear thy god : i am the lord .
and joseph found grace in his sight , and he served him : and he made him overseer over his house , and all that he had he put into his hand .
ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment : thou shalt not respect the person of the poor , nor honour the person of the mighty : but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour .
and his master saw that the lord was with him , and that the lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand .
thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people : neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour : i am the lord .
and the lord was with joseph , and he was a prosperous man ; and he was in the house of his master the egyptian .
thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart : thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour , and not suffer sin upon him .
they compassed me about also with words of hatred ; and fought against me without a cause .
for the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me : they have spoken against me with a lying tongue .
hold not thy peace , o god of my praise ;
when he shall be judged , let him be condemned : and let his prayer become sin .
set thou a wicked man over him : and let satan stand at his right hand .
and they have rewarded me evil for good , and hatred for my love .
for my love they are my adversaries : but i give myself unto prayer .
let his children be fatherless , and his wife a widow .
then he turned his face to the wall , and prayed unto the lord , saying ,
i beseech thee , o lord , remember now how i have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart , and have done that which is good in thy sight . and hezekiah wept sore .
and it came to pass , afore isaiah was gone out into the middle court , that the word of the lord came to him , saying ,
turn again , and tell hezekiah the captain of my people , thus saith the lord , the god of david thy father , i have heard thy prayer , i have seen thy tears : behold , i will heal thee : on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the lord .
in those days was hezekiah sick unto death . and the prophet isaiah the son of amoz came to him , and said unto him , thus saith the lord , set thine house in order ; for thou shalt die , and not live .
and there followed another angel , saying , babylon is fallen , is fallen , that great city , because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication .
and the third angel followed them , saying with a loud voice , if any man worship the beast and his image , and receive his mark in his forehead , or in his hand ,
and i saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven , having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth , and to every nation , and kindred , and tongue , and people ,
and isaiah said , take a lump of figs . and they took and laid it on the boil , and he recovered .
saying with a loud voice , fear god , and give glory to him ; for the hour of his judgment is come : and worship him that made heaven , and earth , and the sea , and the fountains of waters .
and i will add unto thy days fifteen years ; and i will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of assyria ; and i will defend this city for mine own sake , and for my servant david ' s sake .
these are they which were not defiled with women ; for they are virgins . these are they which follow the lamb whithersoever he goeth . these were redeemed from among men , being the firstfruits unto god and to the lamb .
and isaiah said , this sign shalt thou have of the lord , that the lord will do the thing that he hath spoken : shall the shadow go forth ten degrees , or go back ten degrees ?
and in their mouth was found no guile : for they are without fault before the throne of god .
and hezekiah said unto isaiah , what shall be the sign that the lord will heal me , and that i shall go up into the house of the lord the third day ?
and let them make me a sanctuary ; that i may dwell among them .
onyx stones , and stones to be set in the ephod , and in the breastplate .
oil for the light , spices for anointing oil , and for sweet incense ,
and rams ' skins dyed red , and badgers ' skins , and shittim wood ,
according to all that i shew thee , after the pattern of the tabernacle , and the pattern of all the instruments thereof , even so shall ye make it .
and blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine linen , and goats ' hair ,
and this is the offering which ye shall take of them ; gold , and silver , and brass ,
speak unto the children of israel , that they bring me an offering : of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
thus saith the lord to his anointed , to cyrus , whose right hand i have holden , to subdue nations before him ; and i will loose the loins of kings , to open before him the two leaved gates ; and the gates shall not be shut ;
for jacob my servant ' s sake , and israel mine elect , i have even called thee by thy name : i have surnamed thee , though thou hast not known me .
i am the lord , and there is none else , there is no god beside me : i girded thee , though thou hast not known me :
i will go before thee , and make the crooked places straight : i will break in pieces the gates of brass , and cut in sunder the bars of iron :
and i will give thee the treasures of darkness , and hidden riches of secret places , that thou mayest know that i , the lord , which call thee by thy name , am the god of israel .
drop down , ye heavens , from above , and let the skies pour down righteousness : let the earth open , and let them bring forth salvation , and let righteousness spring up together ; i the lord have created it .
woe unto him that striveth with his maker ! let the potsherd strive with the potsherds of the earth . shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it , what makest thou ? or thy work , he hath no hands ?
that they may know from the rising of the sun , and from the west , that there is none beside me . i am the lord , and there is none else .
i form the light , and create darkness : i make peace , and create evil : i the lord do all these things .
the word of the lord also came unto me , saying ,
dig thou through the wall in their sight , and carry out thereby .
in their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulders , and carry it forth in the twilight : thou shalt cover thy face , that thou see not the ground : for i have set thee for a sign unto the house of israel .
therefore , thou son of man , prepare thee stuff for removing , and remove by day in their sight ; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight : it may be they will consider , though they be a rebellious house .
son of man , hath not the house of israel , the rebellious house , said unto thee , what doest thou ?
and i did so as i was commanded : i brought forth my stuff by day , as stuff for captivity , and in the even i digged through the wall with mine hand ; i brought it forth in the twilight , and i bare it upon my shoulder in their sight .
and in the morning came the word of the lord unto me , saying ,
gird yourselves , and lament , ye priests : howl , ye ministers of the altar : come , lie all night in sackcloth , ye ministers of my god : for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your god .
the vine is dried up , and the fig tree languisheth ; the pomegranate tree , the palm tree also , and the apple tree , even all the trees of the field , are withered : because joy is withered away from the sons of men .
alas for the day ! for the day of the lord is at hand , and as a destruction from the almighty shall it come .
sanctify ye a fast , call a solemn assembly , gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the lord your god , and cry unto the lord ,
the seed is rotten under their clods , the garners are laid desolate , the barns are broken down ; for the corn is withered .
is not the meat cut off before our eyes , yea , joy and gladness from the house of our god ?
o lord , to thee will i cry : for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness , and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field .
how do the beasts groan ! the herds of cattle are perplexed , because they have no pasture ; yea , the flocks of sheep are made desolate .
but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age , even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil .
hear me now therefore , o ye children , and depart not from the words of my mouth .
for every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness : for he is a babe .
lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life , her ways are moveable , that thou canst not know them .
lest thou give thine honour unto others , and thy years unto the cruel :
remove thy way far from her , and come not nigh the door of her house :
be ye ashamed , o ye husbandmen ; howl , o ye vinedressers , for the wheat and for the barley ; because the harvest of the field is perished .
the field is wasted , the land mourneth ; for the corn is wasted : the new wine is dried up , the oil languisheth .
but the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them , and then shall they fast in those days .
and he said unto them , can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast , while the bridegroom is with them ?
and they said unto him , why do the disciples of john fast often , and make prayers , and likewise the disciples of the pharisees ; but thine eat and drink ?
i came not to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance .
my son , attend unto my wisdom , and bow thine ear to my understanding :
no man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new : for he saith , the old is better .
that thou mayest regard discretion , and that thy lips may keep knowledge .
called of god an high priest after the order of melchisedec .
for the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb , and her mouth is smoother than oil :
of whom we have many things to say , and hard to be uttered , seeing ye are dull of hearing .
and no man putteth new wine into old bottles ; else the new wine will burst the bottles , and be spilled , and the bottles shall perish .
but her end is bitter as wormwood , sharp as a twoedged sword .
for when for the time ye ought to be teachers , ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of god ; and are become such as have need of milk , and not of strong meat .
and he spake also a parable unto them ; no man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old ; if otherwise , then both the new maketh a rent , and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old .
her feet go down to death ; her steps take hold on hell .
the beasts of the field cry also unto thee : for the rivers of waters are dried up , and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness .
therefore i have profaned the princes of the sanctuary , and have given jacob to the curse , and israel to reproaches .
put me in remembrance : let us plead together : declare thou , that thou mayest be justified .
thy first father hath sinned , and thy teachers have transgressed against me .
and it came to pass on a certain day , as he was teaching , that there were pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by , which were come out of every town of galilee , and judaea , and jerusalem : and the power of the lord was present to heal them .
and he withdrew himself into the wilderness , and prayed .
but so much the more went there a fame abroad of him : and great multitudes came together to hear , and to be healed by him of their infirmities .
and he charged him to tell no man : but go , and shew thyself to the priest , and offer for thy cleansing , according as moses commanded , for a testimony unto them .
and it came to pass , when he was in a certain city , behold a man full of leprosy : who seeing jesus fell on his face , and besought him , saying , lord , if thou wilt , thou canst make me clean .
and when they had brought their ships to land , they forsook all , and followed him .
and so was also james , and john , the sons of zebedee , which were partners with simon . and jesus said unto simon , fear not ; from henceforth thou shalt catch men .
this people have i formed for myself ; they shall shew forth my praise .
the beast of the field shall honour me , the dragons and the owls : because i give waters in the wilderness , and rivers in the desert , to give drink to my people , my chosen .
i , even i , am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake , and will not remember thy sins .
thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money , neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices : but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins , thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities .
and when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude , they went upon the housetop , and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before jesus .
thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings ; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices . i have not caused thee to serve with an offering , nor wearied thee with incense .
and , behold , men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy : and they sought means to bring him in , and to lay him before him .
but thou hast not called upon me , o jacob ; but thou hast been weary of me , o israel .
i am the lord , your holy one , the creator of israel , your king .
and the remnant of jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the lord , as the showers upon the grass , that tarrieth not for man , nor waiteth for the sons of men .
and they shall waste the land of assyria with the sword , and the land of nimrod in the entrances thereof : thus shall he deliver us from the assyrian , when he cometh into our land , and when he treadeth within our borders .
which bringeth forth the chariot and horse , the army and the power ; they shall lie down together , they shall not rise : they are extinct , they are quenched as tow .
and this man shall be the peace , when the assyrian shall come into our land : and when he shall tread in our palaces , then shall we raise against him seven shepherds , and eight principal men .
remember ye not the former things , neither consider the things of old .
and he shall stand and feed in the strength of the lord , in the majesty of the name of the lord his god ; and they shall abide : for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth .
behold , i will do a new thing ; now it shall spring forth ; shall ye not know it ? i will even make a way in the wilderness , and rivers in the desert .
thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries , and all thine enemies shall be cut off .
and the remnant of jacob shall be among the gentiles in the midst of many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest , as a young lion among the flocks of sheep : who , if he go through , both treadeth down , and teareth in pieces , and none can deliver .
and when he saw their faith , he said unto him , man , thy sins are forgiven thee .
therefore will he give them up , until the time that she which travaileth hath brought forth : then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of israel .
but thou , bethlehem ephratah , though thou be little among the thousands of judah , yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in israel ; whose goings forth have been from of old , from everlasting .
now gather thyself in troops , o daughter of troops : he hath laid siege against us : they shall smite the judge of israel with a rod upon the cheek .
and they were all amazed , and they glorified god , and were filled with fear , saying , we have seen strange things to day .
and immediately he rose up before them , and took up that whereon he lay , and departed to his own house , glorifying god .
and he left all , rose up , and followed him .
and kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy : for the lord had made them joyful , and turned the heart of the king of assyria unto them , to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of god , the god of israel .
and after these things he went forth , and saw a publican , named levi , sitting at the receipt of custom : and he said unto him , follow me .
and the children of israel , which were come again out of captivity , and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land , to seek the lord god of israel , did eat ,
but when jesus perceived their thoughts , he answering said unto them , what reason ye in your hearts ?
for the priests and the levites were purified together , all of them were pure , and killed the passover for all the children of the captivity , and for their brethren the priests , and for themselves .
and the scribes and the pharisees began to reason , saying , who is this which speaketh blasphemies ? who can forgive sins , but god alone ?
but that ye may know that the son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins , ( he said unto the sick of the palsy , ) i say unto thee , arise , and take up thy couch , and go into thine house .
whether is easier , to say , thy sins be forgiven thee ; or to say , rise up and walk ?
ye are my witnesses , saith the lord , and my servant whom i have chosen : that ye may know and believe me , and understand that i am he : before me there was no god formed , neither shall there be after me .
i have declared , and have saved , and i have shewed , when there was no strange god among you : therefore ye are my witnesses , saith the lord , that i am god .
and levi made him a great feast in his own house : and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them .
i , even i , am the lord ; and beside me there is no saviour .
thus saith the lord , your redeemer , the holy one of israel ; for your sake i have sent to babylon , and have brought down all their nobles , and the chaldeans , whose cry is in the ships .
yea , before the day was i am he ; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand : i will work , and who shall let it ?
they shall lick the dust like a serpent , they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth : they shall be afraid of the lord our god , and shall fear because of thee .
who is a god like unto thee , that pardoneth iniquity , and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage ? he retaineth not his anger for ever , because he delighteth in mercy .
he will turn again , he will have compassion upon us ; he will subdue our iniquities ; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea .
then said he unto me , prophesy unto the wind , prophesy , son of man , and say to the wind , thus saith the lord god ; come from the four winds , o breath , and breathe upon these slain , that they may live .
and when i beheld , lo , the sinews and the flesh came up upon them , and the skin covered them above : but there was no breath in them .
jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands , and that he was come from god , and went to god ;
he riseth from supper , and laid aside his garments ; and took a towel , and girded himself .
now before the feast of the passover , when jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father , having loved his own which were in the world , he loved them unto the end .
and supper being ended , the devil having now put into the heart of judas iscariot , simon ' s son , to betray him ;
then she that is mine enemy shall see it , and shame shall cover her which said unto me , where is the lord thy god ? mine eyes shall behold her : now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets .
the hand of the lord was upon me , and carried me out in the spirit of the lord , and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones ,
in that day also he shall come even to thee from assyria , and from the fortified cities , and from the fortress even to the river , and from sea to sea , and from mountain to mountain .
in the day that thy walls are to be built , in that day shall the decree be far removed .
so i prophesied as i was commanded : and as i prophesied , there was a noise , and behold a shaking , and the bones came together , bone to his bone .
feed thy people with thy rod , the flock of thine heritage , which dwell solitarily in the wood , in the midst of carmel : let them feed in bashan and gilead , as in the days of old .
and i will lay sinews upon you , and will bring up flesh upon you , and cover you with skin , and put breath in you , and ye shall live ; and ye shall know that i am the lord .
notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein , for the fruit of their doings .
thus saith the lord god unto these bones ; behold , i will cause breath to enter into you , and ye shall live :
the nations shall see and be confounded at all their might : they shall lay their hand upon their mouth , their ears shall be deaf .
again he said unto me , prophesy upon these bones , and say unto them , o ye dry bones , hear the word of the lord .
according to the days of thy coming out of the land of egypt will i shew unto him marvellous things .
from whence come wars and fightings among you ? come they not hence , even of your lusts that war in your members ?
do ye think that the scripture saith in vain , the spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy ?
ye adulterers and adulteresses , know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with god ? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of god .
ye ask , and receive not , because ye ask amiss , that ye may consume it upon your lusts .
ye lust , and have not : ye kill , and desire to have , and cannot obtain : ye fight and war , yet ye have not , because ye ask not .
be afflicted , and mourn , and weep : let your laughter be turned to mourning , and your joy to heaviness .
then cometh he to simon peter : and peter saith unto him , lord , dost thou wash my feet ?
draw nigh to god , and he will draw nigh to you . cleanse your hands , ye sinners ; and purify your hearts , ye double minded .
after that he poureth water into a bason , and began to wash the disciples ' feet , and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded .
submit yourselves therefore to god . resist the devil , and he will flee from you .
peter saith unto him , thou shalt never wash my feet . jesus answered him , if i wash thee not , thou hast no part with me .
but he giveth more grace . wherefore he saith , god resisteth the proud , but giveth grace unto the humble .
jesus answered and said unto him , what i do thou knowest not now ; but thou shalt know hereafter .
simon peter saith unto him , lord , not my feet only , but also my hands and my head .
thou wilt perform the truth to jacob , and the mercy to abraham , which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old .
and all the people went to gilgal ; and there they made saul king before the lord in gilgal ; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the lord ; and there saul and all the men of israel rejoiced greatly .
then said samuel to the people , come , and let us go to gilgal , and renew the kingdom there .
and saul said , there shall not a man be put to death this day : for to day the lord hath wrought salvation in israel .
and the people said unto samuel , who is he that said , shall saul reign over us ? bring the men , that we may put them to death .
therefore the men of jabesh said , to morrow we will come out unto you , and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you .
and say , thus saith the lord god unto jerusalem ; thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of canaan ; thy father was an amorite , and thy mother an hittite .
and as for thy nativity , in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut , neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee ; thou wast not salted at all , nor swaddled at all .
none eye pitied thee , to do any of these unto thee , to have compassion upon thee ; but thou wast cast out in the open field , to the lothing of thy person , in the day that thou wast born .
and when i passed by thee , and saw thee polluted in thine own blood , i said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood , live ; yea , i said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood , live .
again the word of the lord came unto me , saying ,
i have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field , and thou hast increased and waxen great , and thou art come to excellent ornaments : thy breasts are fashioned , and thine hair is grown , whereas thou wast naked and bare .
now when i passed by thee , and looked upon thee , behold , thy time was the time of love ; and i spread my skirt over thee , and covered thy nakedness : yea , i sware unto thee , and entered into a covenant with thee , saith the lord god , and thou becamest mine .
then washed i thee with water ; yea , i throughly washed away thy blood from thee , and i anointed thee with oil .
for it is a day of trouble , and of treading down , and of perplexity by the lord god of hosts in the valley of vision , breaking down the walls , and of crying to the mountains .
and elam bare the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen , and kir uncovered the shield .
all thy rulers are fled together , they are bound by the archers : all that are found in thee are bound together , which have fled from far .
therefore said i , look away from me ; i will weep bitterly , labour not to comfort me , because of the spoiling of the daughter of my people .
ye have seen also the breaches of the city of david , that they are many : and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool .
and it shall come to pass , that thy choicest valleys shall be full of chariots , and the horsemen shall set themselves in array at the gate .
and he discovered the covering of judah , and thou didst look in that day to the armour of the house of the forest .
the burden of the valley of vision . what aileth thee now , that thou art wholly gone up to the housetops ?
thou that art full of stirs , a tumultuous city , a joyous city : thy slain men are not slain with the sword , nor dead in battle .
to wit , the two pillars , and the pommels , and the chapiters which were on the top of the two pillars , and the two wreaths to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were on the top of the pillars ;
and he cried unto the lord , and said , o lord my god , hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom i sojourn , by slaying her son ?
and he set the sea on the right side of the east end , over against the south .
and huram made the pots , and the shovels , and the basons . and huram finished the work that he was to make for king solomon for the house of god ;
and the woman said to elijah , now by this i know that thou art a man of god , and that the word of the lord in thy mouth is truth .
and thou shalt gird them with girdles , aaron and his sons , and put the bonnets on them : and the priest ' s office shall be theirs for a perpetual statute : and thou shalt consecrate aaron and his sons .
and elijah took the child , and brought him down out of the chamber into the house , and delivered him unto his mother : and elijah said , see , thy son liveth .
and the lord heard the voice of elijah ; and the soul of the child came into him again , and he revived .
and he stretched himself upon the child three times , and cried unto the lord , and said , o lord my god , i pray thee , let this child ' s soul come into him again .
and the barrel of meal wasted not , neither did the cruse of oil fail , according to the word of the lord , which he spake by elijah .
and thou shalt put the mitre upon his head , and put the holy crown upon the mitre .
and it came to pass after these things , that the son of the woman , the mistress of the house , fell sick ; and his sickness was so sore , that there was no breath left in him .
and thou shalt take the garments , and put upon aaron the coat , and the robe of the ephod , and the ephod , and the breastplate , and gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod :
for thus saith the lord god of israel , the barrel of meal shall not waste , neither shall the cruse of oil fail , until the day that the lord sendeth rain upon the earth .
and thou shalt bring his sons , and put coats upon them .
and she went and did according to the saying of elijah : and she , and he , and her house , did eat many days .
then shalt thou take the anointing oil , and pour it upon his head , and anoint him .
and unleavened bread , and cakes unleavened tempered with oil , and wafers unleavened anointed with oil : of wheaten flour shalt thou make them .
and this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow them , to minister unto me in the priest ' s office : take one young bullock , and two rams without blemish ,
and she said unto elijah , what have i to do with thee , o thou man of god ? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance , and to slay my son ?
and aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , and shalt wash them with water .
and he said unto her , give me thy son . and he took him out of her bosom , and carried him up into a loft , where he abode , and laid him upon his own bed .
and thou shalt put them into one basket , and bring them in the basket , with the bullock and the two rams .
and the flowers , and the lamps , and the tongs , made he of gold , and that perfect gold ;
and the snuffers , and the basons , and the spoons , and the censers , of pure gold : and the entry of the house , the inner doors thereof for the most holy place , and the doors of the house of the temple , were of gold .
moreover the candlesticks with their lamps , that they should burn after the manner before the oracle , of pure gold ;
and the god that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people , that shall put to their hand to alter and to destroy this house of god which is at jerusalem . i darius have made a decree ; let it be done with speed .
then tatnai , governor on this side the river , shethar - boznai , and their companions , according to that which darius the king had sent , so they did speedily .
that they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the god of heaven , and pray for the life of the king , and of his sons .
and solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of god , the golden altar also , and the tables whereon the shewbread was set ;
thus solomon made all these vessels in great abundance : for the weight of the brass could not be found out .
and they set the priests in their divisions , and the levites in their courses , for the service of god , which is at jerusalem ; as it is written in the book of moses .

in the plain of jordan did the king cast them , in the clay ground between succoth and zeredathah .
and this house was finished on the third day of the month adar , which was in the sixth year of the reign of darius the king .
the pots also , and the shovels , and the fleshhooks , and all their instruments , did huram his father make to king solomon for the house of the lord of bright brass .
and they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends , of wreathen work of pure gold .
this is the word which the lord hath spoken concerning him ; the virgin , the daughter of zion , hath despised thee , and laughed thee to scorn ; the daughter of jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee .
and they made two ouches of gold , and two gold rings ; and put the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate .
then isaiah the son of amoz sent unto hezekiah , saying , thus saith the lord god of israel , whereas thou hast prayed to me against sennacherib king of assyria :
and the fourth row , a beryl , an onyx , and a jasper : they were inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings .
now therefore , o lord our god , save us from his hand , that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the lord , even thou only .
and the stones were according to the names of the children of israel , twelve , according to their names , like the engravings of a signet , every one with his name , according to the twelve tribes .
and the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people : for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son .
and the second row , an emerald , a sapphire , and a diamond .
and the people gat them by stealth that day into the city , as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle .
and the third row , a ligure , an agate , and an amethyst .
and it was told joab , behold , the king weepeth and mourneth for absalom .
and they set in it four rows of stones : the first row was a sardius , a topaz , and a carbuncle : this was the first row .
in that thou lovest thine enemies , and hatest thy friends . for thou hast declared this day , that thou regardest neither princes nor servants : for this day i perceive , that if absalom had lived , and all we had died this day , then it had pleased thee well .
now therefore arise , go forth , and speak comfortably unto thy servants : for i swear by the lord , if thou go not forth , there will not tarry one with thee this night : and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now .
because thy rage against me , and thy tumult , is come up into mine ears , therefore will i put my hook in thy nose , and my bridle in thy lips , and i will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest .
but the king covered his face , and the king cried with a loud voice , o my son absalom , o absalom , my son , my son !
but i know thy abode , and thy going out , and thy coming in , and thy rage against me .
and joab came into the house to the king , and said , thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants , which this day have saved thy life , and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters , and the lives of thy wives , and the lives of thy concubines ;
therefore their inhabitants were of small power , they were dismayed and confounded : they were as the grass of the field , and as the green herb , as the grass on the housetops , and as corn blasted before it be grown up .
hast thou not heard long ago , how i have done it ; and of ancient times , that i have formed it ? now have i brought it to pass , that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities into ruinous heaps .
then the king arose , and sat in the gate . and they told unto all the people , saying , behold , the king doth sit in the gate . and all the people came before the king : for israel had fled every man to his tent .
and all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of israel , saying , the king saved us out of the hand of our enemies , and he delivered us out of the hand of the philistines ; and now he is fled out of the land for absalom .
whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed ? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice , and lifted up thine eyes on high ? even against the holy one of israel .
and they made two rings of gold , and put them on the two ends of the breastplate , upon the border of it , which was on the side of the ephod inward .
and the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the two ouches , and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod , before it .
and they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breastplate .
thus shall ye speak to hezekiah king of judah , saying , let not thy god , in whom thou trustest , deceive thee , saying , jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of assyria .
and the lord called unto moses , and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation , saying ,
and he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering ; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him .
incline thine ear , o lord , and hear ; open thine eyes , o lord , and see : and hear all the words of sennacherib , which hath sent to reproach the living god .
and he shall kill the bullock before the lord : and the priests , aaron ' s sons , shall bring the blood , and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
o lord of hosts , god of israel , that dwellest between the cherubims , thou art the god , even thou alone , of all the kingdoms of the earth : thou hast made heaven and earth .
and have cast their gods into the fire : for they were no gods , but the work of men ' s hands , wood and stone : therefore they have destroyed them .
if his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd , let him offer a male without blemish : 
he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the lord .
of a truth , lord , the kings of assyria have laid waste all the nations , and their countries ,
and the priests , aaron ' s sons , shall lay the parts , the head , and the fat , in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar :
where is the king of hamath , and the king of arphad , and the king of the city of sepharvaim , hena , and ivah ?
but his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water : and the priest shall burn all on the altar , to be a burnt sacrifice , an offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the lord .
have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed , as gozan , and haran , and rezeph , and the children of eden which were in telassar ?
and he shall flay the burnt offering , and cut it into his pieces .
and the sons of aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar , and lay the wood in order upon the fire :
and hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers , and read it : and hezekiah went up unto the house of the lord , and spread it before the lord .
and elijah said unto her , fear not ; go and do as thou hast said : but make me thereof a little cake first , and bring it unto me , and after make for thee and for thy son .
so he arose and went to zarephath . and when he came to the gate of the city , behold , the widow woman was there gathering of sticks : and he called to her , and said , fetch me , i pray thee , a little water in a vessel , that i may drink .
out of the spoils won in battles did they dedicate to maintain the house of the lord .
and the king sent , and they gathered unto him all the elders of judah and of jerusalem .
which shelomith and his brethren were over all the treasures of the dedicated things , which david the king , and the chief fathers , the captains over thousands and hundreds , and the captains of the host , had dedicated .
and the covering of rams ' skins dyed red , and the covering of badgers ' skins , and the vail of the covering ,
and his brethren by eliezer ; rehabiah his son , and jeshaiah his son , and joram his son , and zichri his son , and shelomith his son .
and they tied unto it a lace of blue , to fasten it on high upon the mitre ; as the lord commanded moses .
and shebuel the son of gershom , the son of moses , was ruler of the treasures .
thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation finished : and the children of israel did according to all that the lord commanded moses , so did they .
the pure candlestick , with the lamps thereof , even with the lamps to be set in order , and all the vessels thereof , and the oil for light ,
and the golden altar , and the anointing oil , and the sweet incense , and the hanging for the tabernacle door ,
of the izharites , chenaniah and his sons were for the outward business over israel , for officers and judges .
the ark of the testimony , and the staves thereof , and the mercy seat ,
and all that samuel the seer , and saul the son of kish , and abner the son of ner , and joab the son of zeruiah , had dedicated ; and whosoever had dedicated any thing , it was under the hand of shelomith , and of his brethren .
the table , and all the vessels thereof , and the shewbread ,
of the amramites , and the izharites , the hebronites , and the uzzielites :
the sons of jehieli ; zetham , and joel his brother , which were over the treasures of the house of the lord .
and they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold , and wrote upon it a writing , like to the engravings of a signet , holiness to the lord .
as concerning the sons of laadan ; the sons of the gershonite laadan , chief fathers , even of laadan the gershonite , were jehieli .
and of the levites , ahijah was over the treasures of the house of god , and over the treasures of the dedicated things .
and through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand ; and he shall magnify himself in his heart , and by peace shall destroy many : he shall also stand up against the prince of princes ; but he shall be broken without hand .
nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the lord in jerusalem , but they did eat of the unleavened bread among their brethren .
and the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true : wherefore shut thou up the vision ; for it shall be for many days .
and in the latter time of their kingdom , when the transgressors are come to the full , a king of fierce countenance , and understanding dark sentences , shall stand up .
and he brake down the houses of the sodomites , that were by the house of the lord , where the women wove hangings for the grove .
the brasen altar , and his grate of brass , his staves , and all his vessels , the laver and his foot ,
and he brought out the grove from the house of the lord , without jerusalem , unto the brook kidron , and burned it at the brook kidron , and stamped it small to powder , and cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people .
and i daniel fainted , and was sick certain days ; afterward i rose up , and did the king ' s business ; and i was astonished at the vision , but none understood it .
and they made two other golden rings , and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath , toward the forepart of it , over against the other coupling thereof , above the curious girdle of the ephod .
and they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue , that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod , and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod ; as the lord commanded moses .
and he made the robe of the ephod of woven work , all of blue .
and there was an hole in the midst of the robe , as the hole of an habergeon , with a band round about the hole , that it should not rend .
and they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue , and purple , and scarlet , and twined linen .
and the remnant that is escaped of the house of judah shall again take root downward , and bear fruit upward :
the ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of media and persia .
and they made bells of pure gold , and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe , round about between the pomegranates ;
and this shall be a sign unto thee , ye shall eat this year such as groweth of itself ; and the second year that which springeth of the same : and in the third year sow ye , and reap , and plant vineyards , and eat the fruit thereof .
a bell and a pomegranate , a bell and a pomegranate , round about the hem of the robe to minister in ; as the lord commanded moses .
therefore thus saith the lord concerning the king of assyria , he shall not come into this city , nor shoot an arrow there nor come before it with shields , nor cast a bank against it .
now that being broken , whereas four stood up for it , four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation , but not in his power .
and they made coats of fine linen of woven work for aaron , and for his sons ,
for out of jerusalem shall go forth a remnant , and they that escape out of mount zion : the zeal of the lord of hosts shall do this .
and the rough goat is the king of grecia : and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king .
for i will defend this city to save it for mine own sake , and for my servant david ' s sake .
by the way that he came , by the same shall he return , and shall not come into this city , saith the lord .
and of the hebronites , hashabiah and his brethren , men of valour , a thousand and seven hundred , were officers among them of israel on this side jordan westward in all the business of the lord , and in the service of the king .
so sennacherib king of assyria departed , and went and returned , and dwelt at nineveh .
then the angel of the lord went forth , and smote in the camp of the assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand : and when they arose early in the morning , behold , they were all dead corpses .
and his brethren , men of valour , were two thousand and seven hundred chief fathers , whom king david made rulers over the reubenites , the gadites , and the half tribe of manasseh , for every matter pertaining to god , and affairs of the king .
among the hebronites was jerijah the chief , even among the hebronites , according to the generations of his fathers . in the fortieth year of the reign of david they were sought for , and there were found among them mighty men of valour at jazer of gilead .
and it came to pass , as he was worshipping in the house of nisroch his god , that adrammelech and sharezer his sons smote him with the sword ; and they escaped into the land of armenia : and esar - haddon his son reigned in his stead .
the lord sitteth upon the flood ; yea , the lord sitteth king for ever .
the lord will give strength unto his people ; the lord will bless his people with peace .
and a girdle of fine twined linen , and blue , and purple , and scarlet , of needlework ; as the lord commanded moses .
and an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression , and it cast down the truth to the ground ; and it practised , and prospered .
and a mitre of fine linen , and goodly bonnets of fine linen , and linen breeches of fine twined linen ,
then i heard one saint speaking , and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake , how long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice , and the transgression of desolation , to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot ?
and he said unto me , unto two thousand and three hundred days ; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed .
and it came to pass , when i , even i daniel , had seen the vision , and sought for the meaning , then , behold , there stood before me as the appearance of a man .
and i heard a man ' s voice between the banks of ulai , which called , and said , gabriel , make this man to understand the vision .
so he came near where i stood : and when he came , i was afraid , and fell upon my face : but he said unto me , understand , o son of man : for at the time of the end shall be the vision .
now as he was speaking with me , i was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground : but he touched me , and set me upright .
and he said , behold , i will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation : for at the time appointed the end shall be .
but if thou fear to go down , go thou with phurah thy servant down to the host :
and thou shalt hear what they say ; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host . then went he down with phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host .
and the midianites and the amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude ; and their camels were without number , as the sand by the sea side for multitude .
and his fellow answered and said , this is nothing else save the sword of gideon the son of joash , a man of israel : for into his hand hath god delivered midian , and all the host .
and it was so , when gideon heard the telling of the dream , and the interpretation thereof , that he worshipped , and returned into the host of israel , and said , arise ; for the lord hath delivered into your hand the host of midian .
and he divided the three hundred men into three companies , and he put a trumpet in every man ' s hand , with empty pitchers , and lamps within the pitchers .
and he said unto them , look on me , and do likewise : and , behold , when i come to the outside of the camp , it shall be that , as i do , so shall ye do .
when i blow with a trumpet , i and all that are with me , then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp , and say , the sword of the lord , and of gideon .
so gideon , and the hundred men that were with him , came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch ; and they had but newly set the watch : and they blew the trumpets , and brake the pitchers that were in their hands .
and the three companies blew the trumpets , and brake the pitchers , and held the lamps in their left hands , and the trumpets in their right hands to blow withal : and they cried , the sword of the lord , and of gideon .
and they stood every man in his place round about the camp : and all the host ran , and cried , and fled .
and gideon sent messengers throughout all mount ephraim , saying , come down against the midianites , and take before them the waters unto beth - barah and jordan . then all the men of ephraim gathered themselves together , and took the waters unto beth - barah and jordan .
and they took two princes of the midianites , oreb and zeeb ; and they slew oreb upon the rock oreb , and zeeb they slew at the winepress of zeeb , and pursued midian , and brought the heads of oreb and zeeb to gideon on the other side jordan .
and the three hundred blew the trumpets , and the lord set every man ' s sword against his fellow , even throughout all the host : and the host fled to beth - shittah in zererath , and to the border of abel - meholah , unto tabbath .
and the men of israel gathered themselves together out of naphtali , and out of asher , and out of all manasseh , and pursued after the midianites .
and he said unto them , go ye , and tell that fox , behold , i cast out devils , and i do cures to day and to morrow , and the third day i shall be perfected .
the same day there came certain of the pharisees , saying unto him , get thee out , and depart hence : for herod will kill thee .
and , behold , there are last which shall be first , and there are first which shall be last .
behold , your house is left unto you desolate : and verily i say unto you , ye shall not see me , until the time come when ye shall say , blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord .
o jerusalem , jerusalem , which killest the prophets , and stonest them that are sent unto thee ; how often would i have gathered thy children together , as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings , and ye would not !
nevertheless i must walk to day , and to morrow , and the day following : for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of jerusalem .
and the lot came out for the families of the kohathites : and the children of aaron the priest , which were of the levites , had by lot out of the tribe of judah , and out of the tribe of simeon , and out of the tribe of benjamin , thirteen cities .
and the children of israel gave unto the levites out of their inheritance , at the commandment of the lord , these cities and their suburbs .
and the children of gershon had by lot out of the families of the tribe of issachar , and out of the tribe of asher , and out of the tribe of naphtali , and out of the half tribe of manasseh in bashan , thirteen cities .
and the rest of the children of kohath had by lot out of the families of the tribe of ephraim , and out of the tribe of dan , and out of the half tribe of manasseh , ten cities .
and the children of israel gave by lot unto the levites these cities with their suburbs , as the lord commanded by the hand of moses .
the children of merari by their families had out of the tribe of reuben , and out of the tribe of gad , and out of the tribe of zebulun , twelve cities .
and they gave out of the tribe of the children of judah , and out of the tribe of the children of simeon , these cities which are here mentioned by name ,
then came near the heads of the fathers of the levites unto eleazar the priest , and unto joshua the son of nun , and unto the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of israel ;
and they spake unto them at shiloh in the land of canaan , saying , the lord commanded by the hand of moses to give us cities to dwell in , with the suburbs thereof for our cattle .
there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth , when ye shall see abraham , and isaac , and jacob , and all the prophets , in the kingdom of god , and you yourselves thrust out .
and they shall come from the east , and from the west , and from the north , and from the south , and shall sit down in the kingdom of god .
then shall ye begin to say , we have eaten and drunk in thy presence , and thou hast taught in our streets .
but he shall say , i tell you , i know you not whence ye are ; depart from me , all ye workers of iniquity .
and he hardened pharaoh ' s heart , that he hearkened not unto them ; as the lord had said .
for they cast down every man his rod , and they became serpents : but aaron ' s rod swallowed up their rods .
then pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers : now the magicians of egypt , they also did in like manner with their enchantments .
and moses and aaron went in unto pharaoh , and they did so as the lord had commanded : and aaron cast down his rod before pharaoh , and before his servants , and it became a serpent .
then shalt thou understand righteousness , and judgment , and equity ; yea , every good path .
and again he said , whereunto shall i liken the kingdom of god ?
thus saith the lord , in this thou shalt know that i am the lord : behold , i will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river , and they shall be turned to blood .
it is like leaven , which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal , till the whole was leavened .
and thou shalt say unto him , the lord god of the hebrews hath sent me unto thee , saying , let my people go , that they may serve me in the wilderness : and , behold , hitherto thou wouldest not hear .
get thee unto pharaoh in the morning ; lo , he goeth out unto the water ; and thou shalt stand by the river ' s brink against he come ; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand .
and the lord said unto moses , pharaoh ' s heart is hardened , he refuseth to let the people go .
strive to enter in at the strait gate : for many , i say unto you , will seek to enter in , and shall not be able .
when once the master of the house is risen up , and hath shut to the door , and ye begin to stand without , and to knock at the door , saying , lord , lord , open unto us ; and he shall answer and say unto you , i know you not whence ye are :
and he went through the cities and villages , teaching , and journeying toward jerusalem .
then said one unto him , lord , are there few that be saved ? and he said unto them ,
lest he that heareth it put thee to shame , and thine infamy turn not away .
as an earring of gold , and an ornament of fine gold , so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear .
a word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver .
he layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous : he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly .
all the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred . all these did sheshbazzar bring up with them of the captivity that were brought up from babylon unto jerusalem .
he keepeth the paths of judgment , and preserveth the way of his saints .
thirty basons of gold , silver basons of a second sort four hundred and ten , and other vessels a thousand .
then shalt thou understand the fear of the lord , and find the knowledge of god .
for the lord giveth wisdom : out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding .
yea , if thou criest after knowledge , and liftest up thy voice for understanding ;
if thou seekest her as silver , and searchest for her as for hid treasures ;
my son , if thou wilt receive my words , and hide my commandments with thee ;
so that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom , and apply thine heart to understanding ;
the lord then answered him , and said , thou hypocrite , doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall , and lead him away to watering ?
and ought not this woman , being a daughter of abraham , whom satan hath bound , lo , these eighteen years , be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day ?
and when he had said these things , all his adversaries were ashamed : and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him .
then said he , unto what is the kingdom of god like ? and whereunto shall i resemble it ?
it is like a grain of mustard seed , which a man took , and cast into his garden ; and it grew , and waxed a great tree ; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it .
and he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath .
and , behold , there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years , and was bowed together , and could in no wise lift up herself .
and when jesus saw her , he called her to him , and said unto her , woman , thou art loosed from thine infirmity .
and he laid his hands on her : and immediately she was made straight , and glorified god .
and the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation , because that jesus had healed on the sabbath day , and said unto the people , there are six days in which men ought to work : in them therefore come and be healed , and not on the sabbath day .
that thy way may be known upon earth , thy saving health among all nations .
god be merciful unto us , and bless us ; and cause his face to shine upon us ; selah .
o let the nations be glad and sing for joy : for thou shalt judge the people righteously , and govern the nations upon earth . selah .
let the people praise thee , o god ; let all the people praise thee .
then shall the earth yield her increase ; and god , even our own god , shall bless us .
let the people praise thee , o god ; let all the people praise thee .
god shall bless us ; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him .
who died for us , that , whether we wake or sleep , we should live together with him .
and after that i looked , and , behold , the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened :
and the seven angels came out of the temple , having the seven plagues , clothed in pure and white linen , and having their breasts girded with golden girdles .
and they sing the song of moses the servant of god , and the song of the lamb , saying , great and marvellous are thy works , lord god almighty ; just and true are thy ways , thou king of saints .
who shall not fear thee , o lord , and glorify thy name ? for thou only art holy : for all nations shall come and worship before thee ; for thy judgments are made manifest .
and one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of god , who liveth for ever and ever .
and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of god , and from his power ; and no man was able to enter into the temple , till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled .
pray without ceasing .
in every thing give thanks : for this is the will of god in christ jesus concerning you .

the hangings of the court , his pillars , and his sockets , and the hanging for the court gate , his cords , and his pins , and all the vessels of the service of the tabernacle , for the tent of the congregation ,
these things did benaiah the son of jehoiada , and had the name among three mighty men .
and he slew an egyptian , a goodly man : and the egyptian had a spear in his hand ; but he went down to him with a staff , and plucked the spear out of the egyptian ' s hand , and slew him with his own spear .
and benaiah the son of jehoiada , the son of a valiant man , of kabzeel , who had done many acts , he slew two lionlike men of moab : he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow :
and moses did look upon all the work , and , behold , they have done it as the lord had commanded , even so had they done it : and moses blessed them .
and i saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire : and them that had gotten the victory over the beast , and over his image , and over his mark , and over the number of his name , stand on the sea of glass , having the harps of god .
according to all that the lord commanded moses , so the children of israel made all the work .
helez the paltite , ira the son of ikkesh the tekoite ,
shammah the harodite , elika the harodite ,
asahel the brother of joab was one of the thirty ; elhanan the son of dodo of bethlehem ,
he was more honourable than the thirty , but he attained not to the first three . and david set him over his guard .
and when the king entered into the house of the lord , the guard came and fetched them , and brought them again into the guard chamber .
uriah the hittite : thirty and seven in all .
and when he humbled himself , the wrath of the lord turned from him that he would not destroy him altogether : and also in judah things went well .
ira an ithrite , gareb an ithrite ,
instead of which king rehoboam made shields of brass , and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard , that kept the entrance of the king ' s house .
and rehoboam slept with his fathers , and was buried in the city of david : and abijah his son reigned in his stead .
and he did evil , because he prepared not his heart to seek the lord .

as cold waters to a thirsty soul , so is good news from a far country .
it is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop , than with a brawling woman and in a wide house .
it is not good to eat much honey : so for men to search their own glory is not glory .
a righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled fountain , and a corrupt spring .
confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth , and a foot out of joint .
a man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a maul , and a sword , and a sharp arrow .
withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour ' s house ; lest he be weary of thee , and so hate thee .
hast thou found honey ? eat so much as is sufficient for thee , lest thou be filled therewith , and vomit it .
whoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain .
as the cold of snow in the time of harvest , so is a faithful messenger to them that send him : for he refresheth the soul of his masters .
the north wind driveth away rain : so doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue .
as he that taketh away a garment in cold weather , and as vinegar upon nitre , so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart .
if thine enemy be hungry , give him bread to eat ; and if he be thirsty , give him water to drink :
and when he came to the den , he cried with a lamentable voice unto daniel : and the king spake and said to daniel , o daniel , servant of the living god , is thy god , whom thou servest continually , able to deliver thee from the lions ?
then answered they and said before the king , that daniel , which is of the children of the captivity of judah , regardeth not thee , o king , nor the decree that thou hast signed , but maketh his petition three times a day .
now when daniel knew that the writing was signed , he went into his house ; and his windows being open in his chamber toward jerusalem , he kneeled upon his knees three times a day , and prayed , and gave thanks before his god , as he did aforetime .
then these men assembled , and found daniel praying and making supplication before his god .
then the king commanded , and they brought daniel , and cast him into the den of lions . now the king spake and said unto daniel , thy god whom thou servest continually , he will deliver thee .
and a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den ; and the king sealed it with his own signet , and with the signet of his lords ; that the purpose might not be changed concerning daniel .
then the king , when he heard these words , was sore displeased with himself , and set his heart on daniel to deliver him : and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him .
then these men assembled unto the king , and said unto the king , know , o king , that the law of the medes and persians is , that no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed .
then the king went to his palace , and passed the night fasting : neither were instruments of musick brought before him : and his sleep went from him .
then the king arose very early in the morning , and went in haste unto the den of lions .
then said daniel unto the king , o king , live for ever .
my god hath sent his angel , and hath shut the lions ' mouths , that they have not hurt me : forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me ; and also before thee , o king , have i done no hurt .
then was the king exceeding glad for him , and commanded that they should take daniel up out of the den . so daniel was taken up out of the den , and no manner of hurt was found upon him , because he believed in his god .
then king darius wrote unto all people , nations , and languages , that dwell in all the earth ; peace be multiplied unto you .
i make a decree , that in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the god of daniel : for he is the living god , and stedfast for ever , and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed , and his dominion shall be even unto the end .
he delivereth and rescueth , and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth , who hath delivered daniel from the power of the lions .
so this daniel prospered in the reign of darius , and in the reign of cyrus the persian .
thus saith the lord that made thee , and formed thee from the womb , which will help thee ; fear not , o jacob , my servant ; and thou , jesurun , whom i have chosen .
yet now hear , o jacob my servant ; and israel , whom i have chosen :
they that make a graven image are all of them vanity ; and their delectable things shall not profit ; and they are their own witnesses ; they see not , nor know ; that they may be ashamed .
fear ye not , neither be afraid : have not i told thee from that time , and have declared it ? ye are even my witnesses . is there a god beside me ? yea , there is no god ; i know not any .
and who , as i , shall call , and shall declare it , and set it in order for me , since i appointed the ancient people ? and the things that are coming , and shall come , let them shew unto them .
thus saith the lord the king of israel , and his redeemer the lord of hosts ; i am the first , and i am the last ; and beside me there is no god .
one shall say , i am the lord ' s ; and another shall call himself by the name of jacob ; and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the lord , and surname himself by the name of israel .
and they shall spring up as among the grass , as willows by the water courses .
for i will pour water upon him that is thirsty , and floods upon the dry ground : i will pour my spirit upon thy seed , and my blessing upon thine offspring :
and david was then in an hold , and the garrison of the philistines was then in bethlehem .
and david longed , and said , oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of bethlehem , which is by the gate !
and israel rebelled against the house of david unto this day .
but he stood in the midst of the ground , and defended it , and slew the philistines : and the lord wrought a great victory .
and three of the thirty chief went down , and came to david in the harvest time unto the cave of adullam : and the troop of the philistines pitched in the valley of rephaim .
but as for the children of israel that dwelt in the cities of judah , rehoboam reigned over them .
he arose , and smote the philistines until his hand was weary , and his hand clave unto the sword : and the lord wrought a great victory that day ; and the people returned after him only to spoil .
then king rehoboam sent hadoram that was over the tribute ; and the children of israel stoned him with stones , that he died . but king rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot , to flee to jerusalem .
and after him was shammah the son of agee the hararite . and the philistines were gathered together into a troop , where was a piece of ground full of lentiles : and the people fled from the philistines .
and abishai , the brother of joab , the son of zeruiah , was chief among three . and he lifted up his spear against three hundred , and slew them , and had the name among three .
was he not most honourable of three ? therefore he was their captain : howbeit he attained not unto the first three .
and the three mighty men brake through the host of the philistines , and drew water out of the well of bethlehem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to david : nevertheless he would not drink thereof , but poured it out unto the lord .
and he said , be it far from me , o lord , that i should do this : is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives ? therefore he would not drink it . these things did these three mighty men .
and answered them after the advice of the young men , saying , my father made your yoke heavy , but i will add thereto : my father chastised you with whips , but i will chastise you with scorpions .
and the king answered them roughly ; and king rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men ,
so jeroboam and all the people came to rehoboam on the third day , as the king bade , saying , come again to me on the third day .
for whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you , i will put more to your yoke : my father chastised you with whips , but i will chastise you with scorpions .
and no sin offering , whereof any of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place , shall be eaten : it shall be burnt in the fire .
and these are the generations of esau the father of the edomites in mount seir :
and aholibamah bare jeush , and jaalam , and korah : these are the sons of esau , which were born unto him in the land of canaan .
and esau took his wives , and his sons , and his daughters , and all the persons of his house , and his cattle , and all his beasts , and all his substance , which he had got in the land of canaan ; and went into the country from the face of his brother jacob .
for their riches were more than that they might dwell together ; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle .
thus dwelt esau in mount seir : esau is edom .
now these are the generations of esau , who is edom .
esau took his wives of the daughters of canaan ; adah the daughter of elon the hittite , and aholibamah the daughter of anah the daughter of zibeon the hivite ;
and bashemath ishmael ' s daughter , sister of nebajoth .
and adah bare to esau eliphaz ; and bashemath bare reuel ;

for every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt : it shall not be eaten .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
in a pan it shall be made with oil ; and when it is baken , thou shalt bring it in : and the baken pieces of the meat offering shalt thou offer for a sweet savour unto the lord .
and the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall offer it : it is a statute for ever unto the lord , it shall be wholly burnt .
all the males among the children of aaron shall eat of it . it shall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the offerings of the lord made by fire : every one that toucheth them shall be holy .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
and this is the law of the meat offering : the sons of aaron shall offer it before the lord , before the altar .
and he shall take of it his handful , of the flour of the meat offering , and of the oil thereof , and all the frankincense which is upon the meat offering , and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour , even the memorial of it , unto the lord .
and the remainder thereof shall aaron and his sons eat : with unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place ; in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it .
it shall not be baken with leaven . i have given it unto them for their portion of my offerings made by fire ; it is most holy , as is the sin offering , and as the trespass offering .
and the priest shall put on his linen garment , and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh , and take up the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar , and he shall put them beside the altar .
and he shall put off his garments , and put on other garments , and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place .
and the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it ; it shall not be put out : and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning , and lay the burnt offering in order upon it ; and he shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings .
the fire shall ever be burning upon the altar ; it shall never go out .
and the word of the lord came unto me , saying ,
son of man , set thy face against gog , the land of magog , the chief prince of meshech and tubal , and prophesy against him ,
and say , thus saith the lord god ; behold i am against thee , o gog , the chief prince of meshech and tubal :
and i will turn thee back , and put hooks into thy jaws , and i will bring thee forth , and all thine army , horses and horsemen , all of them clothed with all sorts of armour , even a great company with bucklers and shields , all of them handling swords :
persia , ethiopia , and libya with them ; all of them with shield and helmet :
gomer , and all his bands ; the house of togarmah of the north quarters , and all his bands : and many people with thee .
be thou prepared , and prepare for thyself , thou , and all thy company that are assembled unto thee , and be thou a guard unto them .
thou shalt ascend and come like a storm , thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land , thou , and all thy bands , and many people with thee .

to open the blind eyes , to bring out the prisoners from the prison , and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house .
i am the lord : that is my name : and my glory will i not give to another , neither my praise to graven images .
one young bullock , one ram , one lamb of the first year , for a burnt offering :
behold , the former things are come to pass , and new things do i declare : before they spring forth i tell you of them .
one golden spoon of ten shekels , full of incense :
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two oxen , five rams , five he goats , five lambs of the first year : this was the offering of pagiel the son of ocran .
one kid of the goats for a sin offering :
and he came and touched the bier : and they that bare him stood still . and he said , young man , i say unto thee , arise .
and he that was dead sat up , and began to speak . and he delivered him to his mother .
now when he came nigh to the gate of the city , behold , there was a dead man carried out , the only son of his mother , and she was a widow : and much people of the city was with her .
and when the lord saw her , he had compassion on her , and said unto her , weep not .
and the disciples of john shewed him of all these things .
and john calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to jesus , saying , art thou he that should come ? or look we for another ?
and this rumour of him went forth throughout all judaea , and throughout all the region round about .
the lips of the righteous know what is acceptable : but the mouth of the wicked speaketh frowardness .
the mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom : but the froward tongue shall be cut out .
and thou shalt speak unto all that are wise hearted , whom i have filled with the spirit of wisdom , that they may make aaron ' s garments to consecrate him , that he may minister unto me in the priest ' s office .
and thou shalt make holy garments for aaron thy brother for glory and for beauty .
and they shall take gold , and blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine linen .
it shall have the two shoulderpieces thereof joined at the two edges thereof ; and so it shall be joined together .
and they shall make the ephod of gold , of blue , and of purple , of scarlet , and fine twined linen , with cunning work .
and thou shalt take two onyx stones , and grave on them the names of the children of israel :
and the curious girdle of the ephod , which is upon it , shall be of the same , according to the work thereof ; even of gold , of blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen .
the hope of the righteous shall be gladness : but the expectation of the wicked shall perish .
the fear of the lord prolongeth days : but the years of the wicked shall be shortened .
as vinegar to the teeth , and as smoke to the eyes , so is the sluggard to them that send him .
as the whirlwind passeth , so is the wicked no more : but the righteous is an everlasting foundation .
the fear of the wicked , it shall come upon him : but the desire of the righteous shall be granted .
it is as sport to a fool to do mischief : but a man of understanding hath wisdom .
the blessing of the lord , it maketh rich , and he addeth no sorrow with it .
the lips of the righteous feed many : but fools die for want of wisdom .
the tongue of the just is as choice silver : the heart of the wicked is little worth .
the righteous shall never be removed : but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth .
where the people of israel were slain before the servants of david , and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men .
and david behaved himself wisely in all his ways ; and the lord was with him .
therefore saul removed him from him , and made him his captain over a thousand ; and he went out and came in before the people .
and the king commanded joab and abishai and ittai , saying , deal gently for my sake with the young man , even with absalom . and all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning absalom .
and saul was afraid of david , because the lord was with him , and was departed from saul .
so the people went out into the field against israel : and the battle was in the wood of ephraim ;
and saul cast the javelin ; for he said , i will smite david even to the wall with it . and david avoided out of his presence twice .
and the king said unto them , what seemeth you best i will do . and the king stood by the gate side , and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands .
and david numbered the people that were with him , and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them .
and david said unto saul , who am i ? and what is my life , or my father ' s family in israel , that i should be son in law to the king ?
wherefore when saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely , he was afraid of him .
but all israel and judah loved david , because he went out and came in before them .
but it came to pass at the time when merab saul ' s daughter should have been given to david , that she was given unto adriel the meholathite to wife .
and saul said , i will give him her , that she may be a snare to him , and that the hand of the philistines may be against him . wherefore saul said to david , thou shalt this day be my son in law in the one of the twain .
and michal saul ' s daughter loved david : and they told saul , and the thing pleased him .
and saul ' s servants spake those words in the ears of david . and david said , seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king ' s son in law , seeing that i am a poor man , and lightly esteemed ?
and saul commanded his servants , saying , commune with david secretly , and say , behold , the king hath delight in thee , and all his servants love thee : now therefore be the king ' s son in law .
and saul said , thus shall ye say to david , the king desireth not any dowry , but an hundred foreskins of the philistines , to be avenged of the king ' s enemies . but saul thought to make david fall by the hand of the philistines .
and the servants of saul told him , saying , on this manner spake david .
and when his servants told david these words , it pleased david well to be the king ' s son in law : and the days were not expired .
wherefore david arose and went , he and his men , and slew of the philistines two hundred men ; and david brought their foreskins , and they gave them in full tale to the king , that he might be the king ' s son in law . and saul gave him michal his daughter to wife .
and saul saw and knew that the lord was with david , and that michal saul ' s daughter loved him .
and saul was yet the more afraid of david ; and saul became david ' s enemy continually .
and moses and aaron did so , as the lord commanded ; and he lifted up the rod , and smote the waters that were in the river , in the sight of pharaoh , and in the sight of his servants ; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood .
and pharaoh turned and went into his house , neither did he set his heart to this also .
and all the egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink ; for they could not drink of the water of the river .
and the fish that was in the river died ; and the river stank , and the egyptians could not drink of the water of the river ; and there was blood throughout all the land of egypt .
and the magicians of egypt did so with their enchantments : and pharaoh ' s heart was hardened , neither did he hearken unto them ; as the lord had said .
and seven days were fulfilled , after that the lord had smitten the river .
one young bullock , one ram , one lamb of the first year , for a burnt offering :
one kid of the goats for a sin offering :
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two oxen , five rams , five he goats , five lambs of the first year : this was the offering of eliab the son of helon .
one spoon of gold of ten shekels , full of incense :
one kid of the goats for a sin offering :
one young bullock , one ram , one lamb of the first year , for a burnt offering :
on the third day eliab the son of helon , prince of the children of zebulun , did offer :
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two oxen , five rams , five he goats , five lambs of the first year : this was the offering of nethaneel the son of zuar .
one golden spoon of ten shekels , full of incense :
his offering was one silver charger , the weight whereof was an hundred and thirty shekels , one silver bowl of seventy shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary ; both of them full of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering :
these were the cities appointed for all the children of israel , and for the stranger that sojourneth among them , that whosoever killeth any person at unawares might flee thither , and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood , until he stood before the congregation .
on the second day nethaneel the son of zuar , prince of issachar , did offer :
and on the other side jordan by jericho eastward , they assigned bezer in the wilderness upon the plain out of the tribe of reuben , and ramoth in gilead out of the tribe of gad , and golan in bashan out of the tribe of manasseh .
he offered for his offering one silver charger , the weight whereof was an hundred and thirty shekels , one silver bowl of seventy shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary ; both of them full of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering :
one kid of the goats for a sin offering :
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two oxen , five rams , five he goats , five lambs of the first year : this was the offering of nahshon the son of amminadab .
and if the avenger of blood pursue after him , then they shall not deliver the slayer up into his hand ; because he smote his neighbour unwittingly , and hated him not beforetime .
and they appointed kedesh in galilee in mount naphtali , and shechem in mount ephraim , and kirjath - arba , which is hebron , in the mountain of judah .
and he shall dwell in that city , until he stand before the congregation for judgment , and until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days : then shall the slayer return , and come unto his own city , and unto his own house , unto the city from whence he fled .
and balak did as balaam had said , and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar .
and the lord said unto moses , they shall offer their offering , each prince on his day , for the dedicating of the altar .
the lord also spake unto joshua , saying ,
and the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in the day that it was anointed , even the princes offered their offering before the altar .
speak to the children of israel , saying , appoint out for you cities of refuge , whereof i spake unto you by the hand of moses :
that the slayer that killeth any person unawares and unwittingly may flee thither : and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood .
one young bullock , one ram , one lamb of the first year , for a burnt offering :
one spoon of ten shekels of gold , full of incense :
and balaam said unto balak , build me here seven altars , and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams .
and his offering was one silver charger , the weight thereof was an hundred and thirty shekels , one silver bowl of seventy shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary ; both of them were full of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering :
and he that offered his offering the first day was nahshon the son of amminadab , of the tribe of judah :
make a joyful noise unto god , all ye lands :
and when he came to him , behold , he stood by his burnt offering , and the princes of moab with him . and balak said unto him , what hath the lord spoken ?
the days of our years are threescore years and ten ; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years , yet is their strength labour and sorrow ; for it is soon cut off , and we fly away .
and the lord met balaam , and put a word in his mouth , and said , go again unto balak , and say thus .
who knoweth the power of thine anger ? even according to thy fear , so is thy wrath .
and he brought him into the field of zophim , to the top of pisgah , and built seven altars , and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar .
and balak said unto him , come , i pray thee , with me unto another place , from whence thou mayest see them : thou shalt see but the utmost part of them , and shalt not see them all : and curse me them from thence .
o satisfy us early with thy mercy ; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days .
now upon the first day of the week , very early in the morning , they came unto the sepulchre , bringing the spices which they had prepared , and certain others with them .
and he answered and said , must i not take heed to speak that which the lord hath put in my mouth ?
make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us , and the years wherein we have seen evil .
and they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre .
and balak said unto balaam , what hast thou done unto me ? i took thee to curse mine enemies , and , behold , thou hast blessed them altogether .
so teach us to number our days , that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom .
and they entered in , and found not the body of the lord jesus .
who can count the dust of jacob , and the number of the fourth part of israel ? let me die the death of the righteous , and let my last end be like his !
return , o lord , how long ? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants .
saying , the son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men , and be crucified , and the third day rise again .
he is not here , but is risen : remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in galilee ,
and as they were afraid , and bowed down their faces to the earth , they said unto them , why seek ye the living among the dead ?
and it came to pass , as they were much perplexed thereabout , behold , two men stood by them in shining garments :
god is not a man , that he should lie ; neither the son of man , that he should repent : hath he said , and shall he not do it ? or hath he spoken , and shall he not make it good ?
and returned from the sepulchre , and told all these things unto the eleven , and to all the rest .
and they remembered his words ,
he ruleth by his power for ever ; his eyes behold the nations : let not the rebellious exalt themselves . selah .
he turned the sea into dry land : they went through the flood on foot : there did we rejoice in him .
behold , i have received commandment to bless : and he hath blessed ; and i cannot reverse it .
which holdeth our soul in life , and suffereth not our feet to be moved .
o bless our god , ye people , and make the voice of his praise to be heard :
say unto god , how terrible art thou in thy works ! through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee .
sing forth the honour of his name : make his praise glorious .
come and see the works of god : he is terrible in his doing toward the children of men .
all the earth shall worship thee , and shall sing unto thee ; they shall sing to thy name . selah .
but balaam answered and said unto balak , told not i thee , saying , all that the lord speaketh , that i must do ?
and balak said unto balaam , neither curse them at all , nor bless them at all .
and balak brought balaam unto the top of peor , that looketh toward jeshimon .
god brought them out of egypt ; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn .
he hath not beheld iniquity in jacob , neither hath he seen perverseness in israel : the lord his god is with him , and the shout of a king is among them .
behold , the people shall rise up as a great lion , and lift up himself as a young lion : he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey , and drink the blood of the slain .
surely there is no enchantment against jacob , neither is there any divination against israel : according to this time it shall be said of jacob and of israel , what hath god wrought !
nor thieves , nor covetous , nor drunkards , nor revilers , nor extortioners , shall inherit the kingdom of god .
that which is altogether just shalt thou follow , that thou mayest live , and inherit the land which the lord thy god giveth thee .
and such were some of you : but ye are washed , but ye are sanctified , but ye are justified in the name of the lord jesus , and by the spirit of our god .
all things are lawful unto me , but all things are not expedient : all things are lawful for me , but i will not be brought under the power of any .
neither shalt thou set thee up any image ; which the lord thy god hateth .
meats for the belly , and the belly for meats : but god shall destroy both it and them . now the body is not for fornication , but for the lord ; and the lord for the body .
thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto the altar of the lord thy god , which thou shalt make thee .
flee fornication . every sin that a man doeth is without the body ; but he that commiteth fornication sinneth against his own body .
what ? know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you , which ye have of god , and ye are not your own ?
and god hath both raised up the lord , and will also raise up us by his own power .
know ye not that your bodies are the members of christ ? shall i then take the members of christ , and make them the members of an harlot ? god forbid .
what ? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body ? for two , saith he , shall be one flesh .
but he that is joined unto the lord is one spirit .
and thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the lord thy god with a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand , which thou shalt give unto the lord thy god , according as the lord thy god hath blessed thee :
seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the lord thy god in the place which the lord shall choose : because the lord thy god shall bless thee in all thine increase , and in all the works of thine hands , therefore thou shalt surely rejoice .
for ye are bought with a price : therefore glorify god in your body , and in your spirit , which are god ' s .
and thou shalt rejoice in thy feast , thou , and thy son , and thy daughter , and thy manservant , and thy maidservant , and the levite , the stranger , and the fatherless , and the widow , that are within thy gates .
thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days , after that thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine :
and thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in egypt : and thou shalt observe and do these statutes .
thou shalt not wrest judgment ; thou shalt not respect persons , neither take a gift : for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise , and pervert the words of the righteous .
judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates , which the lord thy god giveth thee , throughout thy tribes : and they shall judge the people with just judgment .
every man shall give as he is able , according to the blessing of the lord thy god which he hath given thee .
three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the lord thy god in the place which he shall choose ; in the feast of unleavened bread , and in the feast of weeks , and in the feast of tabernacles : and they shall not appear before the lord empty :
and i heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels , go your ways , and pour out the vials of the wrath of god upon the earth .
and i commanded you at that time , saying , the lord your god hath given you this land to possess it : ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of israel , all that are meet for the war .
but your wives , and your little ones , and your cattle , ( for i know that ye have much cattle , ) shall abide in your cities which i have given you ;
all the cities of the plain , and all gilead , and all bashan , unto salchah and edrei , cities of the kingdom of og in bashan .
for only og king of bashan remained of the remnant of giants ; behold , his bedstead was a bedstead of iron ; is it not in rabbath of the children of ammon ? nine cubits was the length thereof , and four cubits the breadth of it , after the cubit of a man .
and this land , which we possessed at that time , from aroer , which is by the river arnon , and half mount gilead , and the cities thereof , gave i unto the reubenites and to the gadites .
and the rest of gilead , and all bashan , being the kingdom of og , gave i unto the half tribe of manasseh ; all the region of argob , with all bashan , which was called the land of giants .
jair the son of manasseh took all the country of argob unto the coasts of geshuri and maachathi ; and called them after his own name , bashan - havoth - jair , unto this day .
and i gave gilead unto machir .
and unto the reubenites and unto the gadites i gave from gilead even unto the river arnon half the valley , and the border even unto the river jabbok , which is the border of the children of ammon ;
the plain also , and jordan , and the coast thereof , from chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain , even the salt sea , under ashdoth - pisgah eastward .
to obed - edom southward ; and to his sons the house of asuppim .
to shuppim and hosah the lot came forth westward , with the gate shallecheth , by the causeway of the going up , ward against ward .
and they cast lots , as well the small as the great , according to the house of their fathers , for every gate .
and the lot eastward fell to shelemiah . then for zechariah his son , a wise counseller , they cast lots ; and his lot came out northward .
these are the divisions of the porters among the sons of kore , and among the sons of merari .
eastward were six levites , northward four a day , southward four a day , and toward asuppim two and two .
until the lord have given rest unto your brethren , as well as unto you , and until they also possess the land which the lord your god hath given them beyond jordan : and then shall ye return every man unto his possession , which i have given you .
at parbar westward , four at the causeway , and two at parbar .
hilkiah the second , tebaliah the third , zechariah the fourth : all the sons and brethren of hosah were thirteen .
so we abode in the valley over against beth - peor .
and men were scorched with great heat , and blasphemed the name of god , which hath power over these plagues : and they repented not to give him glory .
and hilkiah the high priest said unto shaphan the scribe , i have found the book of the law in the house of the lord . and hilkiah gave the book to shaphan , and he read it .
and i besought the lord at that time , saying ,
and the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun ; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire .
and shaphan the scribe came to the king , and brought the king word again , and said , thy servants have gathered the money that was found in the house , and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work , that have the oversight of the house of the lord .
o lord god , thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness , and thy mighty hand : for what god is there in heaven or in earth , that can do according to thy works , and according to thy might ?
and i heard another out of the altar say , even so , lord god almighty , true and righteous are thy judgments .
and i commanded joshua at that time , saying , thine eyes have seen all that the lord your god hath done unto these two kings : so shall the lord do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest .
ye shall not fear them : for the lord your god he shall fight for you .
and i heard the angel of the waters say , thou art righteous , o lord , which art , and wast , and shalt be , because thou hast judged thus .
go up to hilkiah the high priest , that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the lord , which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people :
get thee up into the top of pisgah , and lift up thine eyes westward , and northward , and southward , and eastward , and behold it with thine eyes : for thou shalt not go over this jordan .
let thy work appear unto thy servants , and thy glory unto their children .
and let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work , that have the oversight of the house of the lord : and let them give it to the doers of the work which is in the house of the lord , to repair the breaches of the house ,
but charge joshua , and encourage him , and strengthen him : for he shall go over before this people , and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see .
and let the beauty of the lord our god be upon us : and establish thou the work of our hands upon us ; yea , the work of our hands establish thou it .
and the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea ; and it became as the blood of a dead man : and every living soul died in the sea .
unto carpenters , and builders , and masons , and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house .
i pray thee , let me go over , and see the good land that is beyond jordan , that goodly mountain , and lebanon .
and the first went , and poured out his vial upon the earth ; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast , and upon them which worshipped his image .
howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand , because they dealt faithfully .
but the lord was wroth with me for your sakes , and would not hear me : and the lord said unto me , let it suffice thee ; speak no more unto me of this matter .
josiah was eight years old when he began to reign , and he reigned thirty and one years in jerusalem . and his mother ' s name was jedidah , the daughter of adaiah of boscath .
and it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king josiah , that the king sent shaphan the son of azaliah , the son of meshullam , the scribe , to the house of the lord , saying ,
and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord , and walked in all the way of david his father , and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left .
and he said to the woman , thy faith hath saved thee ; go in peace .
but wisdom is justified of all her children .
the son of man is come eating and drinking ; and ye say , behold a gluttonous man , and a winebibber , a friend of publicans and sinners !
and , behold , a woman in the city , which was a sinner , when she knew that jesus sat at meat in the pharisee ' s house , brought an alabaster box of ointment ,
and one of the pharisees desired him that he would eat with him . and he went into the pharisee ' s house , and sat down to meat .
now when the pharisee which had bidden him saw it , he spake within himself , saying , this man , if he were a prophet , would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him : for she is a sinner .
and stood at his feet behind him weeping , and began to wash his feet with tears , and did wipe them with the hairs of her head , and kissed his feet , and anointed them with the ointment .
even every one that is called by my name : for i have created him for my glory , i have formed him ; yea , i have made him .
i will say to the north , give up ; and to the south , keep not back : bring my sons from far , and my daughters from the ends of the earth ;
fear not : for i am with thee : i will bring thy seed from the east , and gather thee from the west ;
since thou wast precious in my sight , thou hast been honourable , and i have loved thee : therefore will i give men for thee , and people for thy life .
let all the nations be gathered together , and let the people be assembled : who among them can declare this , and shew us former things ? let them bring forth their witnesses , that they may be justified : or let them hear , and say , it is truth .
bring forth the blind people that have eyes , and the deaf that have ears .
but the pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of god against themselves , being not baptized of him .
for i am the lord thy god , the holy one of israel , thy saviour : i gave egypt for thy ransom , ethiopia and seba for thee .
and the lord said , whereunto then shall i liken the men of this generation ? and to what are they like ?
they are like unto children sitting in the marketplace , and calling one to another , and saying , we have piped unto you , and ye have not danced ; we have mourned to you , and ye have not wept .
but now thus saith the lord that created thee , o jacob , and he that formed thee , o israel , fear not : for i have redeemed thee , i have called thee by thy name ; thou art mine .
for john the baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine ; and ye say , he hath a devil .
and he said unto her , thy sins are forgiven .
wherefore i say unto thee , her sins , which are many , are forgiven ; for she loved much : but to whom little is forgiven , the same loveth little .
son of man , these men have set up their idols in their heart , and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face : should i be inquired of at all by them ?
my head with oil thou didst not anoint : but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment .
and the word of the lord came unto me , saying ,
thou gavest me no kiss : but this woman since the time i came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet .
then came certain of the elders of israel unto me , and sat before me .
and i will set my face against that man , and will make him a sign and a proverb , and i will cut him off from the midst of my people ; and ye shall know that i am the lord .
and they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves , who is this that forgiveth sins also ?
that i may take the house of israel in their own heart , because they are all estranged from me through their idols .
and if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing , i the lord have deceived that prophet , and i will stretch out my hand upon him , and will destroy him from the midst of my people israel .
and jesus answering said unto him , simon , i have somewhat to say unto thee . and he saith , master , say on .
simon answered and said , i suppose that he , to whom he forgave most . and he said unto him , thou hast rightly judged .
and he turned to the woman , and said unto simon , seest thou this woman ? i entered into thine house , thou gavest me no water for my feet : but she hath washed my feet with tears , and wiped them with the hairs of her head .
there was a certain creditor which had two debtors : the one owed five hundred pence , and the other fifty .
in the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the lord laid , in the month zif :
and he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone , and a row of cedar beams .
and he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers : and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work .
and the two doors were of fir tree : the two leaves of the one door were folding , and the two leaves of the other door were folding .
so also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree , a fourth part of the wall .
the two doors also were of olive tree ; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers , and overlaid them with gold , and spread gold upon the cherubims , and upon the palm trees .
and for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree : the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall .
and the floor of the house he overlaid with gold , within and without .
my son , forget not my law ; but let thine heart keep my commandments :
let not mercy and truth forsake thee : bind them about thy neck ; write them upon the table of thine heart :
for length of days , and long life , and peace , shall they add to thee .
trust in the lord with all thine heart ; and lean not unto thine own understanding .
so shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of god and man .
and in the eleventh year , in the month bul , which is the eighth month , was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof , and according to all the fashion of it . so was he seven years in building it .
in all thy ways acknowledge him , and he shall direct thy paths .
it shall be health to thy navel , and marrow to thy bones .
and jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger , in the land of canaan .
honour the lord with thy substance , and with the firstfruits of all thine increase :
these are the generations of jacob . joseph , being seventeen years old , was feeding the flock with his brethren ; and the lad was with the sons of bilhah , and with the sons of zilpah , his father ' s wives : and joseph brought unto his father their evil report .
now israel loved joseph more than all his children , because he was the son of his old age : and he made him a coat of many colours .
and joseph dreamed a dream , and he told it his brethren : and they hated him yet the more .
and he said unto them , hear , i pray you , this dream which i have dreamed :
for , behold , we were binding sheaves in the field , and , lo , my sheaf arose , and also stood upright ; and , behold , your sheaves stood round about , and made obeisance to my sheaf .
and his brethren said to him , shalt thou indeed reign over us ? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us ? and they hated him yet the more for his dreams , and for his words .
and he dreamed yet another dream , and told it his brethren , and said , behold , i have dreamed a dream more ; and , behold , the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me .
and five cubits was the one wing of the cherub , and five cubits the other wing of the cherub : from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits .
and within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree , each ten cubits high .
the height of the one cherub was ten cubits , and so was it of the other cherub .
and the other cherub was ten cubits : both the cherubims were of one measure and one size .
and the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length , and twenty cubits in breadth , and twenty cubits in the height thereof : and he overlaid it with pure gold ; and so covered the altar which was of cedar .
and the whole house he overlaid with gold , until he had finished all the house : also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold .
so solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold : and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle ; and he overlaid it with gold .
and he overlaid the cherubims with gold .
and he set the cherubims within the inner house : and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims , so that the wing of the one touched the one wall , and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall ; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house .
and he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers , within and without .
moreover the word of the lord came to jeremiah , saying ,
considerest thou not what this people have spoken , saying , the two families which the lord hath chosen , he hath even cast them off ? thus they have despised my people , that they should be no more a nation before them .
thus saith the lord ; if my covenant be not with day and night , and if i have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth ;
then will i cast away the seed of jacob , and david my servant , so that i will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of abraham , isaac , and jacob : for i will cause their captivity to return , and have mercy on them .
thus saith the lord ; if ye can break my covenant of the day , and my covenant of the night , and that there should not be day and night in their season ;
then may also my covenant be broken with david my servant , that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne ; and with the levites the priests , my ministers .
as the host of heaven cannot be numbered , neither the sand of the sea measured : so will i multiply the seed of david my servant , and the levites that minister unto me .
and the word of the lord came to solomon , saying ,
and the word of the lord came unto jeremiah , saying ,
and then he built chambers against all the house , five cubits high : and they rested on the house with timber of cedar .
neither shall the priests the levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings , and to kindle meat offerings , and to do sacrifice continually .
for thus saith the lord ; david shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of israel ;
in those days shall judah be saved , and jerusalem shall dwell safely : and this is the name wherewith she shall be called , the lord our righteousness .
and he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar , both the floor of the house , and the walls of the cieling : and he covered them on the inside with wood , and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir .
so solomon built the house , and finished it .
and i will dwell among the children of israel , and will not forsake my people israel .
concerning this house which thou art in building , if thou wilt walk in my statutes , and execute my judgments , and keep all my commandments to walk in them ; then will i perform my word with thee , which i spake unto david thy father :
and the oracle he prepared in the house within , to set there the ark of the covenant of the lord .
and the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers : all was cedar ; there was no stone seen .
and the house , that is , the temple before it , was forty cubits long .
and he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house , both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar : he even built them for it within , even for the oracle , even for the most holy place .
thus saith the lord ; again there shall be heard in this place , which ye say shall be desolate without man and without beast , even in the cities of judah , and in the streets of jerusalem , that are desolate , without man , and without inhabitant , and without beast ,
behold , the days come , saith the lord , that i will perform that good thing which i have promised unto the house of israel and to the house of judah .
in those days , and at that time , will i cause the branch of righteousness to grow up unto david ; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land .
thus saith the lord of hosts ; again in this place , which is desolate without man and without beast , and in all the cities thereof , shall be an habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down .
woe is me ! for i am as when they have gathered the summer fruits , as the grapegleanings of the vintage : there is no cluster to eat : my soul desired the firstripe fruit .
the best of them is as a brier : the most upright is sharper than a thorn hedge : the day of thy watchmen and thy visitation cometh ; now shall be their perplexity .
the good man is perished out of the earth : and there is none upright among men : they all lie in wait for blood ; they hunt every man his brother with a net .
that they may do evil with both hands earnestly , the prince asketh , and the judge asketh for a reward ; and the great man , he uttereth his mischievous desire : so they wrap it up .
rejoice not against me , o mine enemy : when i fall , i shall arise ; when i sit in darkness , the lord shall be a light unto me .
i will bear the indignation of the lord , because i have sinned against him , until he plead my cause , and execute judgment for me : he will bring me forth to the light , and i shall behold his righteousness .
for the son dishonoureth the father , the daughter riseth up against her mother , the daughter in law against her mother in law ; a man ' s enemies are the men of his own house .
therefore i will look unto the lord ; i will wait for the god of my salvation : my god will hear me .
jesus answered , are there not twelve hours in the day ? if any man walk in the day , he stumbleth not , because he seeth the light of this world .
his disciples say unto him , master , the jews of late sought to stone thee ; and goest thou thither again ?
then after that saith he to his disciples , let us go into judaea again .
praise waiteth for thee , o god , in sion : and unto thee shall the vow be performed .
o thou that hearest prayer , unto thee shall all flesh come .
for , said hushai , thou knowest thy father and his men , that they be mighty men , and they be chafed in their minds , as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field : and thy father is a man of war , and will not lodge with the people .
behold , he is hid now in some pit , or in some other place : and it will come to pass , when some of them be overthrown at the first , that whosoever heareth it will say , there is a slaughter among the people that follow absalom .
thou visitest the earth , and waterest it : thou greatly enrichest it with the river of god , which is full of water : thou preparest them corn , when thou hast so provided for it .
and when hushai was come to absalom , absalom spake unto him , saying , ahithophel hath spoken after this manner : shall we do after his saying ? if not ; speak thou .
they also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens : thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice .
and hushai said unto absalom , the counsel that ahithophel hath given is not good at this time .
which stilleth the noise of the seas , the noise of their waves , and the tumult of the people .
which by his strength setteth fast the mountains ; being girded with power :
by terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us , o god of our salvation ; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth , and of them that are afar off upon the sea :
blessed is the man whom thou choosest , and causest to approach unto thee , that he may dwell in thy courts : we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house , even of thy holy temple .
iniquities prevail against me : as for our transgressions , thou shalt purge them away .
moreover ahithophel said unto absalom , let me now choose out twelve thousand men , and i will arise and pursue after david this night :
now a certain man was sick , named lazarus , of bethany , the town of mary and her sister martha .
( it was that mary which anointed the lord with ointment , and wiped his feet with her hair , whose brother lazarus was sick . )
therefore his sisters sent unto him , saying , lord , behold , he whom thou lovest is sick .
and the saying pleased absalom well , and all the elders of israel .
when jesus heard that , he said , this sickness is not unto death , but for the glory of god , that the son of god might be glorified thereby .
then said absalom , call now hushai the archite also , and let us hear likewise what he saith .
now jesus loved martha , and her sister , and lazarus .
and i will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed , and will make him afraid : and all the people that are with him shall flee ; and i will smite the king only :
when he had heard therefore that he was sick , he abode two days still in the same place where he was .
and i will bring back all the people unto thee : the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned : so all the people shall be in peace .
the rich man shall lie down , but he shall not be gathered : he openeth his eyes , and he is not .
those that remain of him shall be buried in death : and his widows shall not weep .
though he heap up silver as the dust , and prepare raiment as the clay ;
he may prepare it , but the just shall put it on , and the innocent shall divide the silver .
he buildeth his house as a moth , and as a booth that the keeper maketh .
behold , all ye yourselves have seen it ; why then are ye thus altogether vain ?
i will teach you by the hand of god : that which is with the almighty will i not conceal .
if his children be multiplied , it is for the sword : and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread .
this is the portion of a wicked man with god , and the heritage of oppressors , which they shall receive of the almighty .
will he delight himself in the almighty ? will he always call upon god ?
men shall clap their hands at him , and shall hiss him out of his place .
for god shall cast upon him , and not spare : he would fain flee out of his hand .
the east wind carrieth him away , and he departeth : and as a storm hurleth him out of his place .
terrors take hold on him as waters , a tempest stealeth him away in the night .
the word that came to jeremiah from the lord in the tenth year of zedekiah king of judah , which was the eighteenth year of nebuchadrezzar .
for zedekiah king of judah had shut him up , saying , wherefore dost thou prophesy , and say , thus saith the lord , behold , i will give this city into the hand of the king of babylon , and he shall take it ;
and he shall lead zedekiah to babylon , and there shall he be until i visit him , saith the lord : though ye fight with the chaldeans , ye shall not prosper ?
and zedekiah king of judah shall not escape out of the hand of the chaldeans , but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of babylon , and shall speak with him mouth to mouth , and his eyes shall behold his eyes ;
behold , hanameel the son of shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee , saying , buy thee my field that is in anathoth : for the right of redemption is thine to buy it .
and jeremiah said , the word of the lord came unto me , saying ,
and i bought the field of hanameel my uncle ' s son , that was in anathoth , and weighed him the money , even seventeen shekels of silver .
for thou art the god of my strength : why dost thou cast me off ? why go i mourning because of the oppression of the enemy ?
judge me , o god , and plead my cause against an ungodly nation : o deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man .
and joshua called for all israel , and for their elders , and for their heads , and for their judges , and for their officers , and said unto them , i am old and stricken in age :
and it came to pass a long time after that the lord had given rest unto israel from all their enemies round about , that joshua waxed old and stricken in age .
behold , i have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain , to be an inheritance for your tribes , from jordan , with all the nations that i have cut off , even unto the great sea westward .
and ye have seen all that the lord your god hath done unto all these nations because of you ; for the lord your god is he that hath fought for you .
be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of moses , that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left ;
and the lord your god , he shall expel them from before you , and drive them from out of your sight ; and ye shall possess their land , as the lord your god hath promised unto you .
but cleave unto the lord your god , as ye have done unto this day .
that ye come not among these nations , these that remain among you ; neither make mention of the name of their gods , nor cause to swear by them , neither serve them , nor bow yourselves unto them :
for the lord hath driven out from before you great nations and strong : but as for you , no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day .
o send out thy light and thy truth : let them lead me ; let them bring me unto thy holy hill , and to thy tabernacles .
then will i go unto the altar of god , unto god my exceeding joy : yea , upon the harp will i praise thee , o god my god .
why art thou cast down , o my soul ? and why art thou disquieted within me ? hope in god : for i shall yet praise him , who is the health of my countenance , and my god .
and the lord turned a mighty strong west wind , which took away the locusts , and cast them into the red sea ; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of egypt .
and he went out from pharaoh , and intreated the lord .
of the firstborn of the children of israel took he the money ; a thousand three hundred and threescore and five shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary :
and moses gave the money of them that were redeemed unto aaron and to his sons , according to the word of the lord , as the lord commanded moses .
and moses stretched forth his rod over the land of egypt , and the lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day , and all that night ; and when it was morning , the east wind brought the locusts .
and the lord said unto moses , stretch out thine hand over the land of egypt for the locusts , that they may come up upon the land of egypt , and eat every herb of the land , even all that the hail hath left .
not so : go now ye that are men , and serve the lord ; for that ye did desire . and they were driven out from pharaoh ' s presence .
and he said unto them , let the lord be so with you , as i will let you go , and your little ones : look to it ; for evil is before you .
now therefore forgive , i pray thee , my sin only this once , and intreat the lord your god , that he may take away from me this death only .
then pharaoh called for moses and aaron in haste ; and he said , i have sinned against the lord your god , and against you .
and the locusts went up over all the land of egypt , and rested in all the coasts of egypt : very grievous were they ; before them there were no such locusts as they , neither after them shall be such .
but if ye have respect to persons , ye commit sin , and are convinced of the law as transgressors .
and ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing , and say unto him , sit thou here in a good place ; and say to the poor , stand thou there , or sit here under my footstool :
for if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring , in goodly apparel , and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment ;
my brethren , have not the faith of our lord jesus christ , the lord of glory , with respect of persons .
do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called ?
but ye have despised the poor . do not rich men oppress you , and draw you before the judgment seats ?
hearken , my beloved brethren , hath not god chosen the poor of this world rich in faith , and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him ?
are ye not then partial in yourselves , and are become judges of evil thoughts ?
and moses said , thou hast spoken well , i will see thy face again no more .
and moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven ; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of egypt three days :
and the lord said unto moses , stretch out thine hand toward heaven , that there may be darkness over the land of egypt , even darkness which may be felt .
and pharaoh called unto moses , and said , go ye , serve the lord ; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed : let your little ones also go with you .
they saw not one another , neither rose any from his place for three days : but all the children of israel had light in their dwellings .
our cattle also shall go with us ; there shall not an hoof be left behind ; for thereof must we take to serve the lord our god ; and we know not with what we must serve the lord , until we come thither .
and moses said , thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings , that we may sacrifice unto the lord our god .
and pharaoh said unto him , get thee from me , take heed to thyself , see my face no more ; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die .
but the lord hardened pharaoh ' s heart , and he would not let them go .
but the lord hardened pharaoh ' s heart , so that he would not let the children of israel go .
and the chief of the house of the father of the families of the kohathites shall be elizaphan the son of uzziel .
and their charge shall be the ark , and the table , and the candlestick , and the altars , and the vessels of the sanctuary wherewith they minister , and the hanging , and all the service thereof .
and eleazar the son of aaron the priest shall be chief over the chief of the levites , and have the oversight of them that keep the charge of the sanctuary .
of merari was the family of the mahlites , and the family of the mushites : these are the families of merari .
yet he filled their houses with good things : but the counsel of the wicked is far from me .
the righteous see it , and are glad : and the innocent laugh them to scorn .
and the chief of the house of the father of the families of merari was zuriel the son of abihail : these shall pitch on the side of the tabernacle northward .
is not god in the height of heaven ? and behold the height of the stars , how high they are !
and those that were numbered of them , according to the number of all the males , from a month old and upward , were six thousand and two hundred .
and thou sayest , how doth god know ? can he judge through the dark cloud ?
and the pillars of the court round about , and their sockets , and their pins , and their cords .
therefore snares are round about thee , and sudden fear troubleth thee ;
and under the custody and charge of the sons of merari shall be the boards of the tabernacle , and the bars thereof , and the pillars thereof , and the sockets thereof , and all the vessels thereof , and all that serveth thereto ,
or darkness , that thou canst not see ; and abundance of waters cover thee .
all that were numbered of the levites , which moses and aaron numbered at the commandment of the lord , throughout their families , all the males from a month old and upward , were twenty and two thousand .
which were cut down out of time , whose foundation was overflown with a flood :
but those that encamp before the tabernacle toward the east , even before the tabernacle of the congregation eastward , shall be moses , and aaron and his sons , keeping the charge of the sanctuary for the charge of the children of israel ; and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death .
which said unto god , depart from us : and what can the almighty do for them ?
thick clouds are a covering to him , that he seeth not ; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven .
hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden ?
and the lord said unto moses , number all the firstborn of the males of the children of israel from a month old and upward , and take the number of their names .
and all the firstborn males by the number of names , from a month old and upward , of those that were numbered of them , were twenty and two thousand two hundred and threescore and thirteen .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
and thou shalt take the levites for me ( i am the lord ) instead of all the firstborn among the children of israel ; and the cattle of the levites instead of all the firstlings among the cattle of the children of israel .
and he said , i will make all my goodness pass before thee , and i will proclaim the name of the lord before thee ; and will be gracious to whom i will be gracious , and will shew mercy on whom i will shew mercy .
and moses numbered , as the lord commanded him , all the firstborn among the children of israel .
and he said , i beseech thee , shew me thy glory .
and the lord said unto moses , i will do this thing also that thou hast spoken : for thou hast found grace in my sight , and i know thee by name .
for wherein shall it be known here that i and thy people have found grace in thy sight ? is it not in that thou goest with us ? so shall we be separated , i and thy people , from all the people that are upon the face of the earth .
and he said unto him , if thy presence go not with me , carry us not up hence .
and he said , my presence shall go with thee , and i will give thee rest .
now therefore , i pray thee , if i have found grace in thy sight , shew me now thy way , that i may know thee , that i may find grace in thy sight : and consider that this nation is thy people .
and moses said unto the lord , see , thou sayest unto me , bring up this people : and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me . yet thou hast said , i know thee by name , and thou hast also found grace in my sight .
and the lord spake unto moses face to face , as a man speaketh unto his friend . and he turned again into the camp : but his servant joshua , the son of nun , a young man , departed not out of the tabernacle .
and all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door : and all the people rose up and worshipped , every man in his tent door .
and thou shalt give the money , wherewith the odd number of them is to be redeemed , unto aaron and to his sons .
thou shalt even take five shekels apiece by the poll , after the shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take them : ( the shekel is twenty gerahs : )
and for those that are to be redeemed of the two hundred and threescore and thirteen of the firstborn of the children of israel , which are more than the levites ;
take the levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of israel , and the cattle of the levites instead of their cattle ; and the levites shall be mine : i am the lord .
and moses took the redemption money of them that were over and above them that were redeemed by the levites :
and it shall come to pass , while my glory passeth by , that i will put thee in a clift of the rock , and will cover thee with my hand while i pass by :
and i will take away mine hand , and thou shalt see my back parts : but my face shall not be seen .
he shall deliver the island of the innocent : and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
and thou shalt appoint aaron and his sons , and they shall wait on their priest ' s office : and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death .
and moses numbered them according to the word of the lord , as he was commanded .
and these were the sons of levi by their names ; gershon , and kohath , and merari .
and these are the names of the sons of gershon by their families ; libni , and shimei .
and the sons of kohath by their families ; amram , and izehar , hebron , and uzziel .
and i , behold , i have taken the levites from among the children of israel instead of all the firstborn that openeth the matrix among the children of israel : therefore the levites shall be mine ;
and the lord said , like as my servant isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and wonder upon egypt and upon ethiopia ;
because all the firstborn are mine ; for on the day that i smote all the firstborn in the land of egypt i hallowed unto me all the firstborn in israel , both man and beast : mine shall they be : i am the lord .
so shall the king of assyria lead away the egyptians prisoners , and the ethiopians captives , young and old , naked and barefoot , even with their buttocks uncovered , to the shame of egypt .
and the lord spake unto moses in the wilderness of sinai , saying ,
number the children of levi after the house of their fathers , by their families : every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them .
at the same time spake the lord by isaiah the son of amoz , saying , go and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins , and put off thy shoe from thy foot . and he did so , walking naked and barefoot .
if we say that we have not sinned , we make him a liar , and his word is not in us .
and they shall be afraid and ashamed of ethiopia their expectation , and of egypt their glory .
and the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day , behold , such is our expectation , whither we flee for help to be delivered from the king of assyria : and how shall we escape ?
and the lord said , behold , there is a place by me , and thou shalt stand upon a rock :
and he said , thou canst not see my face : for there shall no man see me , and live .
wherefore shall we die before thine eyes , both we and our land ? buy us and our land for bread , and we and our land will be servants unto pharaoh : and give us seed , that we may live , and not die , that the land be not desolate .
and when money failed in the land of egypt , and in the land of canaan , all the egyptians came unto joseph , and said , give us bread : for why should we die in thy presence ? for the money faileth .
those that were numbered of them , according to the number of all the males , from a month old and upward , even those that were numbered of them were seven thousand and five hundred .
and joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of egypt , and in the land of canaan , for the corn which they bought : and joseph brought the money into pharaoh ' s house .
of gershon was the family of the libnites , and the family of the shimites : these are the families of the gershonites .
in that day , saith the lord of hosts , shall the nail that is fastened in the sure place be removed , and be cut down , and fall ; and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off : for the lord hath spoken it .
and the sons of merari by their families ; mahli , and mushi . these are the families of the levites according to the house of their fathers .
and they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father ' s house , the offspring and the issue , all vessels of small quantity , from the vessels of cups , even to all the vessels of flagons .
and joseph said , give your cattle ; and i will give you for your cattle , if money fail .
whereas our substance is not cut down , but the remnant of them the fire consumeth .
and joseph placed his father and his brethren , and gave them a possession in the land of egypt , in the best of the land , in the land of rameses , as pharaoh had commanded .
and the key of the house of david will i lay upon his shoulder ; so he shall open , and none shall shut ; and he shall shut , and none shall open .
and jacob blessed pharaoh , and went out from before pharaoh .
and i will clothe him with thy robe , and strengthen him with thy girdle , and i will commit thy government into his hand : and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of jerusalem , and to the house of judah .
and there was no bread in all the land ; for the famine was very sore , so that the land of egypt and all the land of canaan fainted by reason of the famine .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that i will call my servant eliakim the son of hilkiah :
and joseph nourished his father , and his brethren , and all his father ' s household , with bread , according to their families .
the families of the sons of kohath shall pitch on the side of the tabernacle southward .
for then shalt thou have thy delight in the almighty , and shalt lift up thy face unto god .
yea , the almighty shall be thy defence , and thou shalt have plenty of silver .
and of kohath was the family of the amramites , and the family of the izeharites , and the family of the hebronites , and the family of the uzzielites : these are the families of the kohathites .
thou shalt also decree a thing , and it shall be established unto thee : and the light shall shine upon thy ways .
and joseph bought all the land of egypt for pharaoh ; for the egyptians sold every man his field , because the famine prevailed over them : so the land became pharaoh ' s .
in the number of all the males , from a month old and upward , were eight thousand and six hundred , keeping the charge of the sanctuary .
thou shalt make thy prayer unto him , and he shall hear thee , and thou shalt pay thy vows .
and the charge of the sons of gershon in the tabernacle of the congregation shall be the tabernacle , and the tent , the covering thereof , and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation ,
receive , i pray thee , the law from his mouth , and lay up his words in thine heart .
and the hangings of the court , and the curtain for the door of the court , which is by the tabernacle , and by the altar round about , and the cords of it for all the service thereof .
acquaint now thyself with him , and be at peace : thereby good shall come unto thee .
the families of the gershonites shall pitch behind the tabernacle westward .
then shalt thou lay up gold as dust , and the gold of ophir as the stones of the brooks .
and the chief of the house of the father of the gershonites shall be eliasaph the son of lael .
if thou return to the almighty , thou shalt be built up , thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles .
when men are cast down , then thou shalt say , there is lifting up ; and he shall save the humble person .
and it shall come to pass in the increase , that ye shall give the fifth part unto pharaoh , and four parts shall be your own , for seed of the field , and for your food , and for them of your households , and for food for your little ones .
wisdom hath builded her house , she hath hewn out her seven pillars :
then joseph said unto the people , behold , i have bought you this day and your land for pharaoh : lo , here is seed for you , and ye shall sow the land .
only the land of the priests bought he not ; for the priests had a portion assigned them of pharaoh , and did eat their portion which pharaoh gave them : wherefore they sold not their lands .
ye made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of the old pool : but ye have not looked unto the maker thereof , neither had respect unto him that fashioned it long ago .
and as for the people , he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of egypt even to the other end thereof .
and ye have numbered the houses of jerusalem , and the houses have ye broken down to fortify the wall .
and jacob lived in the land of egypt seventeen years : so the whole age of jacob was an hundred forty and seven years .
and behold joy and gladness , slaying oxen , and killing sheep , eating flesh , and drinking wine : let us eat and drink ; for to morrow we shall die .
and israel dwelt in the land of egypt , in the country of goshen ; and they had possessions therein , and grew , and multiplied exceedingly .
and in that day did the lord god of hosts call to weeping , and to mourning , and to baldness , and to girding with sackcloth :
and joseph made it a law over the land of egypt unto this day , that pharaoh should have the fifth part ; except the land of the priests only , which became not pharaoh ' s .
thus saith the lord god of hosts , go , get thee unto this treasurer , even unto shebna , which is over the house , and say ,
and they said , thou hast saved our lives : let us find grace in the sight of my lord , and we will be pharaoh ' s servants .
and it was revealed in mine ears by the lord of hosts , surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die , saith the lord god of hosts .
reprove not a scorner , lest he hate thee : rebuke a wise man , and he will love thee .
what hast thou here ? and whom hast thou here , that thou hast hewed thee out a sepulchre here , as he that heweth him out a sepulchre on high , and that graveth an habitation for himself in a rock ?
give instruction to a wise man , and he will be yet wiser : teach a just man , and he will increase in learning .
behold , the lord will carry thee away with a mighty captivity , and will surely cover thee .
forsake the foolish , and live ; and go in the way of understanding .
he will surely violently turn and toss thee like a ball into a large country : there shalt thou die , and there the chariots of thy glory shall be the shame of thy lord ' s house .
he that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame : and he that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot .
and i will drive thee from thy station , and from thy state shall he pull thee down .
but i will lie with my fathers , and thou shalt carry me out of egypt , and bury me in their buryingplace . and he said , i will do as thou hast said .
whoso is simple , let him turn in hither : as for him that wanteth understanding , she saith to him ,
and he said , swear unto me . and he sware unto him . and israel bowed himself upon the bed ' s head .
come , eat of my bread , and drink of the wine which i have mingled .
she hath killed her beasts ; she hath mingled her wine ; she hath also furnished her table .
she hath sent forth her maidens : she crieth upon the highest places of the city ,
if any man trespass against his neighbour , and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear , and the oath come before thine altar in this house :
and hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant , and of thy people israel , when they shall pray toward this place : and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place : and when thou hearest , forgive .
and he said , lord god of israel , there is no god like thee , in heaven above , or on earth beneath , who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart :
and no man was able to answer him a word , neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions .
who hast kept with thy servant david my father that thou promisedst him : thou spakest also with thy mouth , and hast fulfilled it with thine hand , as it is this day .
and i have set there a place for the ark , wherein is the covenant of the lord , which he made with our fathers , when he brought them out of the land of egypt .
the lord said unto my lord , sit thou on my right hand , till i make thine enemies thy footstool ?
and solomon stood before the altar of the lord in the presence of all the congregation of israel , and spread forth his hands toward heaven :
if david then call him lord , how is he his son ?
but will god indeed dwell on the earth ? behold , the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee ; how much less this house that i have builded ?
saying , what think ye of christ ? whose son is he ? they say unto him , the son of david .
yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant , and to his supplication , o lord my god , to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer , which thy servant prayeth before thee to day :
he saith unto them , how then doth david in spirit call him lord , saying ,
on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets .
and now , o god of israel , let thy word , i pray thee , be verified , which thou spakest unto thy servant david my father .
while the pharisees were gathered together , jesus asked them ,
that thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day , even toward the place of which thou hast said , my name shall be there : that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward this place .
( for they shall hear of thy great name , and of thy strong hand , and of thy stretched out arm ; ) when he shall come and pray toward this house ;
moreover concerning a stranger , that is not of thy people israel , but cometh out of a far country for thy name ' s sake ;
then hear thou in heaven , and do , and judge thy servants , condemning the wicked , to bring his way upon his head ; and justifying the righteous , to give him according to his righteousness .
and when the multitude heard this , they were astonished at his doctrine .
when thy people israel be smitten down before the enemy , because they have sinned against thee , and shall turn again to thee , and confess thy name , and pray , and make supplication unto thee in this house :
but when the pharisees had heard that he had put the sadducees to silence , they were gathered together .
then one of them , which was a lawyer , asked him a question , tempting him , and saying ,
master , which is the great commandment in the law ?
then hear thou in heaven , and forgive the sin of thy servants , and of thy people israel , that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk , and give rain upon thy land , which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance .
if there be in the land famine , if there be pestilence , blasting , mildew , locust , or if there be caterpiller ; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities ; whatsoever plague , whatsoever sickness there be ;
for in the resurrection they neither marry , nor are given in marriage , but are as the angels of god in heaven .
what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man , or by all thy people israel , which shall know every man the plague of his own heart , and spread forth his hands toward this house :
but as touching the resurrection of the dead , have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by god , saying ,
then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place , and forgive , and do , and give to every man according to his ways , whose heart thou knowest ; ( for thou , even thou only , knowest the hearts of all the children of men ; )
i am the god of abraham , and the god of isaac , and the god of jacob ? god is not the god of the dead , but of the living .
jesus said unto him , thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind .
this is the first and great commandment .
and the second is like unto it , thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself .
for thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth , to be thine inheritance , as thou spakest by the hand of moses thy servant , when thou broughtest our fathers out of egypt , o lord god .
that thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant , and unto the supplication of thy people israel , to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee .
for they be thy people , and thine inheritance , which thou broughtest forth out of egypt , from the midst of the furnace of iron :
and forgive thy people that have sinned against thee and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee , and give them compassion before them who carried them captive , that they may have compassion on them :
then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling place , and maintain their cause ,
but ahaz said , i will not ask , neither will i tempt the lord .
ask thee a sign of the lord thy god ; ask it either in the depth , or in the height above .
yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were carried captives , and repent , and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captives , saying , we have sinned , and have done perversely , we have committed wickedness ;
moreover the lord spake again unto ahaz , saying ,
then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication , and maintain their cause .
for before the child shall know to refuse the evil , and choose the good , the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings .
if they sin against thee , ( for there is no man that sinneth not , ) and thou be angry with them , and deliver them to the enemy , so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy , far or near ;
butter and honey shall he eat , that he may know to refuse the evil , and choose the good .
therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign ; behold , a virgin shall conceive , and bear a son , and shall call his name immanuel .
if thy people go out to battle against their enemy , whithersoever thou shalt send them , and shall pray unto the lord toward the city which thou hast chosen , and toward the house that i have built for thy name :
and he said , hear ye now , o house of david ; is it a small thing for you to weary men , but will ye weary my god also ?
( for the children being not yet born , neither having done any good or evil , that the purpose of god according to election might stand , not of works , but of him that calleth ; )
and not only this ; but when rebecca also had conceived by one , even by our father isaac ;
and the king , and all israel with him , offered sacrifice before the lord .
let your heart therefore be perfect with the lord our god , to walk in his statutes , and to keep his commandments , as at this day .
and solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings , which he offered unto the lord , two and twenty thousand oxen , and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep . so the king and all the children of israel dedicated the house of the lord .
that all the people of the earth may know that the lord is god , and that there is none else .
that he may incline our hearts unto him , to walk in all his ways , and to keep his commandments , and his statutes , and his judgments , which he commanded our fathers .
and let these my words , wherewith i have made supplication before the lord , be nigh unto the lord our god day and night , that he maintain the cause of his servant , and the cause of his people israel at all times , as the matter shall require :
and it was so , that when solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the lord , he arose from before the altar of the lord , from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven .
and he stood , and blessed all the congregation of israel with a loud voice , saying ,
blessed be the lord , that hath given rest unto his people israel , according to all that he promised : there hath not failed one word of all his good promise , which he promised by the hand of moses his servant .
the lord our god be with us , as he was with our fathers : let him not leave us , nor forsake us :
then he called for a light , and sprang in , and came trembling , and fell down before paul and silas ,
jesus said unto him , let the dead bury their dead : but go thou and preach the kingdom of god .
and when they had laid many stripes upon them , they cast them into prison , charging the jailor to keep them safely :
and jesus said unto him , no man , having put his hand to the plough , and looking back , is fit for the kingdom of god .
nay but , o man , who art thou that repliest against god ? shall the thing formed say to him that formed it , why hast thou made me thus ?
who , having received such a charge , thrust them into the inner prison , and made their feet fast in the stocks .
and another also said , lord , i will follow thee ; but let me first go bid them farewell , which are at home at my house .
hath not the potter power over the clay , of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour , and another unto dishonour ?
and teach customs , which are not lawful for us to receive , neither to observe , being romans .
and the multitude rose up together against them : and the magistrates rent off their clothes , and commanded to beat them .
and the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep , and seeing the prison doors open , he drew out his sword , and would have killed himself , supposing that the prisoners had been fled .
but paul cried with a loud voice , saying , do thyself no harm : for we are all here .
and at midnight paul and silas prayed , and sang praises unto god : and the prisoners heard them .
and suddenly there was a great earthquake , so that the foundations of the prison were shaken : and immediately all the doors were opened , and every one ' s bands were loosed .
for the scripture saith unto pharaoh , even for this same purpose have i raised thee up , that i might shew my power in thee , and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth .
and the days that david reigned over israel were forty years : seven years reigned he in hebron , and thirty and three years reigned he in jerusalem .
so then it is not of him that willeth , nor of him that runneth , but of god that sheweth mercy .
so david slept with his fathers , and was buried in the city of david .
thou wilt say then unto me , why doth he yet find fault ? for who hath resisted his will ?
therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy , and whom he will he hardeneth .
as it is written , jacob have i loved , but esau have i hated .
and they said , believe on the lord jesus christ , and thou shalt be saved , and thy house .
it was said unto her , the elder shall serve the younger .
and brought them out , and said , sirs , what must i do to be saved ?
for he saith to moses , i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy , and i will have compassion on whom i will have compassion .
what shall we say then ? is there unrighteousness with god ? god forbid .
if the thief be not found , then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges , to see whether he have put his hand unto his neighbour ' s goods .
if a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep , and it be stolen out of the man ' s house ; if the thief be found , let him pay double .
and bath - sheba said , well ; i will speak for thee unto the king .
if fire break out , and catch in thorns , so that the stacks of corn , or the standing corn , or the field , be consumed therewith ; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution .
on the eighth day he sent the people away : and they blessed the king , and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the lord had done for david his servant , and for israel his people .
and he said , speak , i pray thee , unto solomon the king , ( for he will not say thee nay , ) that he give me abishag the shunammite to wife .
if a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten , and shall put in his beast , and shall feed in another man ' s field ; of the best of his own field , and of the best of his own vineyard , shall he make restitution .
and at that time solomon held a feast , and all israel with him , a great congregation , from the entering in of hamath unto the river of egypt , before the lord our god , seven days and seven days , even fourteen days .
and now i ask one petition of thee , deny me not . and she said unto him , say on .
if the theft be certainly found in his hand alive , whether it be ox , or ass , or sheep ; he shall restore double .
and he said , thou knowest that the kingdom was mine , and that all israel set their faces on me , that i should reign : howbeit the kingdom is turned about , and is become my brother ' s : for it was his from the lord .
if the sun be risen upon him , there shall be blood shed for him ; for he should make full restitution ; if he have nothing , then he shall be sold for his theft .
he said moreover , i have somewhat to say unto thee . and she said , say on .
if a thief be found breaking up , and be smitten that he die , there shall no blood be shed for him .
and adonijah the son of haggith came to bath - sheba the mother of solomon . and she said , comest thou peaceably ? and he said , peaceably .
if a man shall steal an ox , or a sheep , and kill it , or sell it ; he shall restore five oxen for an ox , and four sheep for a sheep .
then sat solomon upon the throne of david his father ; and his kingdom was established greatly .
and this did she many days . but paul , being grieved , turned and said to the spirit , i command thee in the name of jesus christ to come out of her . and he came out the same hour .
and when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone , they caught paul and silas , and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers ,
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the lord shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of egypt , and for the bee that is in the land of assyria .
the lord shall bring upon thee , and upon thy people , and upon thy father ' s house , days that have not come , from the day that ephraim departed from judah ; even the king of assyria .
and they shall come , and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys , and in the holes of the rocks , and upon all thorns , and upon all bushes .
wherefore ? because they sought it not by faith , but as it were by the works of the law . for they stumbled at that stumblingstone ;
and after he had seen the vision , immediately we endeavored to go into macedonia , assuredly gathering that the lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them .
and they did not receive him , because his face was as though he would go to jerusalem .
as it is written , behold , i lay in sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence : and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed .
therefore loosing from troas , we came with a straight course to samothracia , and the next day to neapolis ;
and sent messengers before his face : and they went , and entered into a village of the samaritans , to make ready for him .
what shall we say then ? that the gentiles , which followed not after righteousness , have attained to righteousness , even the righteousness which is of faith .
and from thence to philippi , which is the chief city of that part of macedonia , and a colony : and we were in that city abiding certain days .
and on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side , where prayer was wont to be made ; and we sat down , and spake unto the women which resorted thither .
and it came to pass , that , as they went in the way , a certain man said unto him , lord , i will follow thee whithersoever thou goest .
and when she was baptized , and her household , she besought us , saying , if ye have judged me to be faithful to the lord , come into my house , and abide there . and she constrained us .
for the son of man is not come to destroy men ' s lives , but to save them . and they went to another village .
and it came to pass , as we went to prayer , a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us , which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying :
but he turned , and rebuked them , and said , ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of .
the same followed paul and us , and cried , saying , these men are the servants of the most high god , which shew unto us the way of salvation .
and as esaias said before , except the lord of sabaoth had left us a seed , we had been as sodoma , and been made like unto gomorrha .
for he will finish the work , and cut it short in righteousness : because a short work will the lord make upon the earth .
and jesus said unto him , foxes have holes , and birds of the air have nests ; but the son of man hath not where to lay his head .
esaias also crieth concerning israel , though the number of the children of israel be as the sand of the sea , a remnant shall be saved :
and he said unto another , follow me . but he said , lord , suffer me first to go and bury my father .
and it shall come to pass , that in the place where it was said unto them , ye are not my people ; there shall they be called the children of the living god .
as he saith also in osee , i will call them my people , which were not my people ; and her beloved , which was not beloved .
even us , whom he hath called , not of the jews only , but also of the gentiles ?
and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy , which he had afore prepared unto glory ,
with arrows and with bows shall men come thither ; because all the land shall become briers and thorns .
and on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock , there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns : but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen , and for the treading of lesser cattle .
in the same day shall the lord shave with a rasor that is hired , namely , by them beyond the river , by the king of assyria , the head , and the hair of the feet : and it shall also consume the beard .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that a man shall nourish a young cow , and two sheep ;
and it shall come to pass , for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter : for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that every place shall be , where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings , it shall even be for briers and thorns .
be strong and of a good courage , fear not , nor be afraid of them : for the lord thy god , he it is that doth go with thee ; he will not fail thee , nor forsake thee .
and moses called unto joshua , and said unto him in the sight of all israel , be strong and of a good courage : for thou must go with this people unto the land which the lord hath sworn unto their fathers to give them ; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it .
and the lord , he it is that doth go before thee ; he will be with thee , he will not fail thee , neither forsake thee : fear not , neither be dismayed .
and moses wrote this law , and delivered it unto the priests the sons of levi , which bare the ark of the covenant of the lord , and unto all the elders of israel .
and he said unto them , i am an hundred and twenty years old this day ; i can no more go out and come in : also the lord hath said unto me , thou shalt not go over this jordan .
and the lord shall do unto them as he did to sihon and to og , kings of the amorites , and unto the land of them , whom he destroyed .
and the lord shall give them up before your face , that ye may do unto them according unto all the commandments which i have commanded you .
and moses went and spake these words unto all israel .
their blood shall therefore return upon the head of joab , and upon the head of his seed for ever : but upon david , and upon his seed , and upon his house , and upon his throne , shall there be peace for ever from the lord .
and the king said unto him , do as he hath said , and fall upon him , and bury him ; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood , which joab shed , from me , and from the house of my father .
and benaiah came to the tabernacle of the lord , and said unto him , thus saith the king , come forth . and he said , nay ; but i will die here . and benaiah brought the king word again , saying , thus said joab , and thus he answered me .
for it shall be , that on the day thou goest out , and passest over the brook kidron , thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die : thy blood shall be upon thine own head .
and the king sent and called for shimei , and said unto him , build thee an house in jerusalem , and dwell there , and go not forth thence any whither .
and the king put benaiah the son of jehoiada in his room over the host : and zadok the priest did the king put in the room of abiathar .
so benaiah the son of jehoiada went up , and fell upon him , and slew him : and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness .
and it came to pass at the end of three years , that two of the servants of shimei ran away unto achish son of maachah king of gath . and they told shimei , saying , behold , thy servants be in gath .
and shimei said unto the king , the saying is good : as my lord the king hath said , so will thy servant do . and shimei dwelt in jerusalem many days .
james , a servant of god and of the lord jesus christ , to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad , greeting .
my brethren , count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations ;
knowing this , that the trying of your faith worketh patience .
but let patience have her perfect work , that ye may be perfect and entire , wanting nothing .
if any of you lack wisdom , let him ask of god , that giveth to all men liberally , and upbraideth not ; and it shall be given him .
but let him ask in faith , nothing wavering . for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed .
for let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the lord .
a double minded man is unstable in all his ways .
let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted :
and the keeper of the prison told this saying to paul , the magistrates have sent to let you go : now therefore depart , and go in peace .
but paul said unto them , they have beaten us openly uncondemned , being romans , and have cast us into prison ; and now do they thrust us out privily ? nay verily ; but let them come themselves and fetch us out .
and the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates : and they feared , when they heard that they were romans .
and they came and besought them , and brought them out , and desired them to depart out of the city .
and they spake unto him the word of the lord , and to all that were in his house .
and he took them the same hour of the night , and washed their stripes ; and was baptized , he and all his , straightway .
and when he had brought them into his house , he set meat before them , and rejoiced , believing in god with all his house .
and when it was day , the magistrates sent the serjeants , saying , let those men go .
and they went out of the prison , and entered into the house of lydia and when they had seen the brethren , they comforted them , and departed .
and that which is left of the meat offering shall be aaron ' s and his sons ' : it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the lord made by fire .
no meat offering , which ye shall bring unto the lord , shall be made with leaven : for ye shall burn no leaven , nor any honey , in any offering of the lord made by fire .
as for the oblation of the firstfruits , ye shall offer them unto the lord : but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour .
and every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt ; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy god to be lacking from thy meat offering : with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt .
then she said , i desire one small petition of thee ; i pray thee , say me not nay . and the king said unto her , ask on , my mother : for i will not say thee nay .
and if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the lord , thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green ears of corn dried by the fire , even corn beaten out of full ears .
and thou shalt put oil upon it , and lay frankincense thereon : it is a meat offering .
and king solomon answered and said unto his mother , and why dost thou ask abishag the shunammite for adonijah ? ask for him the kingdom also ; for he is mine elder brother ; even for him , and for abiathar the priest , and for joab the son of zeruiah .
and the priest shall burn the memorial of it , part of the beaten corn thereof , and part of the oil thereof , with all the frankincense thereof : it is an offering made by fire unto the lord .
and she said , let abishag the shunammite be given to adonijah thy brother to wife .
now therefore , as the lord liveth , which hath established me , and set me on the throne of david my father , and who hath made me an house , as he promised , adonijah shall be put to death this day .
then king solomon sware by the lord , saying , god do so to me , and more also , if adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life .
and king solomon sent by the hand of benaiah the son of jehoiada ; and he fell upon him that he died .
then tidings came to joab : for joab had turned after adonijah , though he turned not after absalom . and joab fled unto the tabernacle of the lord , and caught hold on the horns of the altar .
and it was told king solomon that joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the lord ; and , behold , he is by the altar . then solomon sent benaiah the son of jehoiada , saying , go , fall upon him .
and it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings , he took peter and john and james , and went up into a mountain to pray .
and judah went against the canaanites that dwelt in hebron : ( now the name of hebron before was kirjath - arba : ) and they slew sheshai , and ahiman , and talmai .
for whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words , of him shall the son of man be ashamed , when he shall come in his own glory , and in his father ' s , and of the holy angels .
and from thence he went against the inhabitants of debir : and the name of debir before was kirjath - sepher :
for what is a man advantaged , if he gain the whole world , and lose himself , or be cast away ?
and caleb said , he that smiteth kirjath - sepher , and taketh it , to him will i give achsah my daughter to wife .
and othniel the son of kenaz , caleb ' s younger brother , took it : and he gave him achsah his daughter to wife .
and it came to pass , when she came to him , that she moved him to ask of her father a field : and she lighted from off her ass ; and caleb said unto her , what wilt thou ?
and as he prayed , the fashion of his countenance was altered , and his raiment was white and glistering .
and the children of the kenite , moses ' father in law , went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of judah into the wilderness of judah , which lieth in the south of arad ; and they went and dwelt among the people .
also judah took gaza with the coast thereof , and askelon with the coast thereof , and ekron with the coast thereof .
he said unto them , but whom say ye that i am ? peter answering said , the christ of god .
and judah went with simeon his brother , and they slew the canaanites that inhabited zephath , and utterly destroyed it . and the name of the city was called hormah .
and the lord was with judah ; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain ; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley , because they had chariots of iron .
and he said to them all , if any man will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross daily , and follow me .
for whosoever will save his life shall lose it : but whosoever will lose his life for my sake , the same shall save it .
saying , the son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be slain , and be raised the third day .
he said also unto me , turn thee yet again , and thou shalt see greater abominations that they do .
then he brought me to the door of the gate of the lord ' s house which was toward the north ; and , behold , there sat women weeping for tammuz .
and there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of israel , and in the midst of them stood jaazaniah the son of shaphan , with every man his censer in his hand ; and a thick cloud of incense went up .
then said he unto me , son of man , hast thou seen what the ancients of the house of israel do in the dark , every man in the chambers of his imagery ? for they say , the lord seeth us not ; the lord hath forsaken the earth .
therefore will i also deal in fury : mine eye shall not spare , neither will i have pity : and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice , yet will i not hear them .
then said he unto me , hast thou seen this , o son of man ? turn thee yet again , and thou shalt see greater abominations than these .
and king solomon shall be blessed , and the throne of david shall be established before the lord for ever .
so i went in and saw ; and behold every form of creeping things , and abominable beasts , and all the idols of the house of israel , pourtrayed upon the wall round about .
so the king commanded benaiah the son of jehoiada ; which went out , and fell upon him , that he died . and the kingdom was established in the hand of solomon .
and they did so , and made them all sit down .
why then hast thou not kept the oath of the lord , and the commandment that i have charged thee with ?
and the house of joseph , they also went up against bethel : and the lord was with them .
for they were about five thousand men . and he said to his disciples , make them sit down by fifties in a company .
the king said moreover to shimei , thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to , that thou didst to david my father : therefore the lord shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head ;
and the house of joseph sent to descry bethel . ( now the name of the city before was luz . )
and it was told solomon that shimei had gone from jerusalem to gath , and was come again .
and they gave hebron unto caleb , as moses said : and he expelled thence the three sons of anak .
then he took the five loaves and the two fishes , and looking up to heaven , he blessed them , and brake , and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude .
and the children of benjamin did not drive out the jebusites that inhabited jerusalem ; but the jebusites dwell with the children of benjamin in jerusalem unto this day .
they answering said , john the baptist ; but some say , elias ; and others say , that one of the old prophets is risen again .
and the man went into the land of the hittites , and built a city , and called the name thereof luz : which is the name thereof unto this day .
and shimei arose , and saddled his ass , and went to gath to achish to seek his servants : and shimei went , and brought his servants from gath .
neither did manasseh drive out the inhabitants of beth - shean and her towns , nor taanach and her towns , nor the inhabitants of dor and her towns , nor the inhabitants of ibleam and her towns , nor the inhabitants of megiddo and her towns : but the canaanites would dwell in that land .
and the spies saw a man come forth out of the city , and they said unto him , shew us , we pray thee , the entrance into the city , and we will shew thee mercy .
and when he shewed them the entrance into the city , they smote the city with the edge of the sword ; but they let go the man and all his family .
neither did ephraim drive out the canaanites that dwelt in gezer ; but the canaanites dwelt in gezer among them .
and it came to pass , when israel was strong , that they put the canaanites to tribute , and did not utterly drive them out .
and the apostles , when they were returned , told him all that they had done . and he took them , and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called bethsaida .
and the people , when they knew it , followed him : and he received them , and spake unto them of the kingdom of god , and healed them that had need of healing .
but he said unto them , give ye them to eat . and they said , we have no more but five loaves and two fishes ; except we should go and buy meat for all this people .
and the men of beth - shemesh said , who is able to stand before this holy lord god ? and to whom shall he go up from us ?
and they sent messengers to the inhabitants of kirjath - jearim , saying , the philistines have brought again the ark of the lord ; come ye down , and fetch it up to you .
neither did zebulun drive out the inhabitants of kitron , nor the inhabitants of nahalol ; but the canaanites dwelt among them , and became tributaries .
but the amorites would dwell in mount heres in aijalon , and in shaalbim : yet the hand of the house of joseph prevailed , so that they became tributaries .
and the coast of the amorites was from the going up to akrabbim , from the rock , and upward .
neither did asher drive out the inhabitants of accho , nor the inhabitants of zidon , nor of ahlab , nor of achzib , nor of helbah , nor of aphik , nor of rehob :
but the asherites dwelt among the canaanites , the inhabitants of the land : for they did not drive them out .
and said unto them , whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me : and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me : for he that is least among you all , the same shall be great .
neither did naphtali drive out the inhabitants of beth - shemesh , nor the inhabitants of beth - anath ; but he dwelt among the canaanites , the inhabitants of the land : nevertheless the inhabitants of beth - shemesh and of beth - anath became tributaries unto them .
and jesus , perceiving the thought of their heart , took a child , and set him by him ,
so he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness : and i saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast , full of names of blasphemy , having seven heads and ten horns .
but they understood not this saying , and it was hid from them , that they perceived it not : and they feared to ask him of that saying .
and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour , and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls , having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication :
then there arose a reasoning among them , which of them should be greatest .
and there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials , and talked with me , saying unto me , come hither ; i will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters :
and they were all amazed at the mighty power of god . but while they wondered every one at all things which jesus did , he said unto his disciples ,
with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication , and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication .
let these sayings sink down into your ears : for the son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men .
and the angel said unto me , wherefore didst thou marvel ? i will tell thee the mystery of the woman , and of the beast that carrieth her , which hath the seven heads and ten horns .
and jesus answering said , o faithless and perverse generation , how long shall i be with you , and suffer you ? bring thy son hither .
and as he was yet a coming , the devil threw him down , and tare him . and jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the child , and delivered him again to his father .
and he smote the men of beth - shemesh , because they had looked into the ark of the lord , even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men : and the people lamented , because the lord had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter .
and upon her forehead was a name written , mystery , babylon the great , the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth .
and when the five lords of the philistines had seen it , they returned to ekron the same day .
and i saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints , and with the blood of the martyrs of jesus : and when i saw her , i wondered with great admiration .
and these are the golden emerods which the philistines returned for a trespass offering unto the lord ; for ashdod one , for gaza one , for askelon one , for gath one , for ekron one ;
and the cart came into the field of joshua , a beth - shemite , and stood there , where there was a great stone : and they clave the wood of the cart , and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the lord .
and the levites took down the ark of the lord , and the coffer that was with it , wherein the jewels of gold were , and put them on the great stone : and the men of beth - shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the lord .
and the kine took the straight way to the way of beth - shemesh , and went along the highway , lowing as they went , and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left ; and the lords of the philistines went after them unto the border of beth - shemesh .
and they of beth - shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley : and they lifted up their eyes , and saw the ark , and rejoiced to see it .
and the men did so ; and took two milch kine , and tied them to the cart , and shut up their calves at home :
and they laid the ark of the lord upon the cart , and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods .
and it came to pass , that on the next day , when they were come down from the hill , much people met him .
and when the voice was past , jesus was found alone . and they kept it close , and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen .
and , lo , a spirit taketh him , and he suddenly crieth out ; and it teareth him that he foameth again , and bruising him hardly departeth from him .
but peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep : and when they were awake , they saw his glory , and the two men that stood with him .
and it came to pass , as they departed from him , peter said unto jesus , master , it is good for us to be here : and let us make three tabernacles ; one for thee , and one for moses , and one for elias : not knowing what he said .
while he thus spake , there came a cloud , and overshadowed them : and they feared as they entered into the cloud .
and there came a voice out of the cloud , saying , this is my beloved son : hear him .
and , behold , there talked with him two men , which were moses and elias :
and i will also take of them for priests and for levites , saith the lord .
for as the new heavens and the new earth , which i will make , shall remain before me , saith the lord , so shall your seed and your name remain .
and it shall come to pass , that from one new moon to another , and from one sabbath to another , shall all flesh come to worship before me , saith the lord .
and they shall go forth , and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me : for their worm shall not die , neither shall their fire be quenched ; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh .
then he questioned with him in many words ; but he answered him nothing .
and as soon as he knew that he belonged unto herod ' s jurisdiction , he sent him to herod , who himself also was at jerusalem at that time .
and they were the more fierce , saying , he stirreth up the people , teaching throughout all jewry , beginning from galilee to this place .
when pilate heard of galilee , he asked whether the man were a galilaean .
and they began to accuse him , saying , we found this fellow perverting the nation , and forbidding to give tribute to caesar , saying that he himself is christ a king .
and the whole multitude of them arose , and led him unto pilate .
then said pilate to the chief priests and to the people , i find no fault in this man .
and pilate asked him , saying , art thou the king of the jews ? and he answered him and said , thou sayest it .
nevertheless thou shalt not build the house ; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins , he shall build the house unto my name .
and the lord said unto david my father , whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name , thou didst well that it was in thine heart .
and it was in the heart of david my father to build an house for the name of the lord god of israel .
since the day that i brought forth my people israel out of egypt , i chose no city out of all the tribes of israel to build an house , that my name might be therein ; but i chose david to be over my people israel .
and he said , blessed be the lord god of israel , which spake with his mouth unto david my father , and hath with his hand fulfilled it , saying ,
and the king turned his face about , and blessed all the congregation of israel : ( and all the congregation of israel stood ; )
i have surely built thee an house to dwell in , a settled place for thee to abide in for ever .
they that sanctify themselves , and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst , eating swine ' s flesh , and the abomination , and the mouse , shall be consumed together , saith the lord .
then spake solomon , the lord said that he would dwell in thick darkness .
for by fire and by his sword will the lord plead with all flesh : and the slain of the lord shall be many .
so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud : for the glory of the lord had filled the house of the lord .
and it came to pass , when the priests were come out of the holy place , that the cloud filled the house of the lord ,
for i know their works and their thoughts : it shall come , that i will gather all nations and tongues ; and they shall come , and see my glory .
for thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity , and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty .
for thus saith the lord , behold , i will extend peace to her like a river , and the glory of the gentiles like a flowing stream : then shall ye suck , ye shall be borne upon her sides , and be dandled upon her knees .
thine own mouth condemneth thee , and not i : yea , thine own lips testify against thee .
as one whom his mother comforteth , so will i comfort you ; and ye shall be comforted in jerusalem .
art thou the first man that was born ? or wast thou made before the hills ?
and when ye see this , your heart shall rejoice , and your bones shall flourish like an herb : and the hand of the lord shall be known toward his servants , and his indignation toward his enemies .
hast thou heard the secret of god ? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself ?
for , behold , the lord will come with fire , and with his chariots like a whirlwind , to render his anger with fury , and his rebuke with flames of fire .
what knowest thou , that we know not ? what understandest thou , which is not in us ?
rejoice ye with jerusalem , and be glad with her , all ye that love her : rejoice for joy with her , all ye that mourn for her :
that ye may suck , and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations ; that ye may milk out , and be delighted with the abundance of her glory .
then answered eliphaz the temanite , and said ,
should a wise man utter vain knowledge , and fill his belly with the east wind ?
should he reason with unprofitable talk ? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good ?
yea , thou castest off fear , and restrainest prayer before god .
we took sweet counsel together , and walked unto the house of god in company .
but it was thou , a man mine equal , my guide , and mine acquaintance .
as for me , i will call upon god ; and the lord shall save me .
let death seize upon them , and let them go down quick into hell : for wickedness is in their dwellings , and among them .
but bade them farewell , saying , i must by all means keep this feast that cometh in jerusalem : but i will return again unto you , if god will . and he sailed from ephesus .
day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof : mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it .
and when he had landed at caesarea , and gone up , and saluted the church , he went down to antioch .
hear my voice , o god , in my prayer : preserve my life from fear of the enemy .
for it was not an enemy that reproached me ; then i could have borne it : neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me ; then i would have hid myself from him :
hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked ; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity :
when they desired him to tarry longer time with them , he consented not ;
wickedness is in the midst thereof : deceit and guile depart not from her streets .
who whet their tongue like a sword , and bend their bows to shoot their arrows , even bitter words :
so the workmen wrought , and the work was perfected by them , and they set the house of god in his state , and strengthened it .
and the king and jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the lord , and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the lord , and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the lord .
and all the princes and all the people rejoiced , and brought in , and cast into the chest , until they had made an end .
and when zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of gaal the son of ebed , his anger was kindled .
much people of the jews therefore knew that he was there : and they came not for jesus ' sake only , but that they might see lazarus also , whom he had raised from the dead .
now after the death of jehoiada came the princes of judah , and made obeisance to the king . then the king hearkened unto them .
he hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me : for there were many with me .
for the poor always ye have with you ; but me ye have not always .
and they buried him in the city of david among the kings , because he had done good in israel , both toward god , and toward his house .
evening , and morning , and at noon , will i pray , and cry aloud : and he shall hear my voice .
then said jesus , let her alone : against the day of my burying hath she kept this .
but jehoiada waxed old , and was full of days when he died ; an hundred and thirty years old was he when he died .
this he said , not that he cared for the poor ; but because he was a thief , and had the bag , and bare what was put therein .
god shall hear , and afflict them , even he that abideth of old . selah . because they have no changes , therefore they fear not god .
and the men of shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains , and they robbed all that came along that way by them : and it was told abimelech .
that the cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of jerubbaal might come , and their blood be laid upon abimelech their brother , which slew them ; and upon the men of shechem , which aided him in the killing of his brethren .
and they left the house of the lord god of their fathers , and served groves and idols : and wrath came upon judah and jerusalem for this their trespass .
and they went out into the fields , and gathered their vineyards , and trode the grapes , and made merry , and went into the house of their god , and did eat and drink , and cursed abimelech .
yet he sent prophets to them , to bring them again unto the lord ; and they testified against them : but they would not give ear .
and gaal the son of ebed came with his brethren , and went over to shechem : and the men of shechem put their confidence in him .
and jotham ran away , and fled , and went to beer , and dwelt there , for fear of abimelech his brother .
but if not , let fire come out from abimelech , and devour the men of shechem , and the house of millo ; and let fire come out from the men of shechem , and from the house of millo , and devour abimelech .
then god sent an evil spirit between abimelech and the men of shechem ; and the men of shechem dealt treacherously with abimelech :
when abimelech had reigned three years over israel ,
but if it be a question of words and names , and of your law , look ye to it ; for i will be no judge of such matters .
and when paul was now about to open his mouth , gallio said unto the jews , if it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness , o ye jews , reason would that i should bear with you :
saying , this fellow persuadeth men to worship god contrary to the law .
and when gallio was the deputy of achaia , the jews made insurrection with one accord against paul , and brought him to the judgment seat ,
and he came to ephesus , and left them there : but he himself entered into the synagogue , and reasoned with the jews .
and would to god this people were under my hand ! then would i remove abimelech . and he said to abimelech , increase thine army , and come out .
and paul after this tarried there yet a good while , and then took his leave of the brethren , and sailed thence into syria , and with him priscilla and aquila ; having shorn his head in cenchrea : for he had a vow .
and gaal the son of ebed said , who is abimelech , and who is shechem , that we should serve him ? is not he the son of jerubbaal ? and zebul his officer ? serve the men of hamor the father of shechem : for why should we serve him ?
then all the greeks took sosthenes , the chief ruler of the synagogue , and beat him before the judgment seat . and gallio cared for none of those things .
and he drave them from the judgment seat .
but thou , o god , shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction : bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days ; but i will trust in thee .
cast thy burden upon the lord , and he shall sustain thee : he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved .
the words of his mouth were smoother than butter , but war was in his heart : his words were softer than oil , yet were they drawn swords .
he hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him : he hath broken his covenant .
there they made him a supper ; and martha served : but lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him .
now therefore , if ye have done truly and sincerely , in that ye have made abimelech king , and if ye have dealt well with jerubbaal and his house , and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands ;
then took mary a pound of ointment of spikenard , very costly , and anointed the feet of jesus , and wiped his feet with her hair : and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment .
and he cast stones at david , and at all the servants of king david : and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left .
and the bramble said unto the trees , if in truth ye anoint me king over you , then come and put your trust in my shadow : and if not , let fire come out of the bramble , and devour the cedars of lebanon .
then saith one of his disciples , judas iscariot , simon ' s son , which should betray him ,
and the king said , and where is thy master ' s son ? and ziba said unto the king , behold , he abideth at jerusalem : for he said , to day shall the house of israel restore me the kingdom of my father .
then said all the trees unto the bramble , come thou , and reign over us .
why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence , and given to the poor ?
then said the king to ziba , behold , thine are all that pertained unto mephibosheth . and ziba said , i humbly beseech thee that i may find grace in thy sight , my lord , o king .
and the vine said unto them , should i leave my wine , which cheereth god and man , and go to be promoted over the trees ?
and when david was a little past the top of the hill , behold , ziba the servant of mephibosheth met him , with a couple of asses saddled , and upon them two hundred loaves of bread , and an hundred bunches of raisins , and an hundred of summer fruits , and a bottle of wine .
and the king said unto ziba , what meanest thou by these ? and ziba said , the asses be for the king ' s household to ride on ; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat ; and the wine , that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink .
but the fig tree said unto them , should i forsake my sweetness , and my good fruit , and go to be promoted over the trees ?
and the trees said to the fig tree , come thou , and reign over us .
then jesus six days before the passover came to bethany , where lazarus was which had been dead , whom he raised from the dead .
and a certain jew named apollos , born at alexandria , an eloquent man , and mighty in the scriptures , came to ephesus .
but god shall shoot at them with an arrow ; suddenly shall they be wounded .
and after he had spent some time there , he departed , and went over all the country of galatia and phrygia in order , strengthening all the disciples .
they search out iniquities ; they accomplish a diligent search : both the inward thought of every one of them , and the heart , is deep .
and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue : whom when aquila and priscilla had heard , they took him unto them , and expounded unto him the way of god more perfectly .
they encourage themselves in an evil matter : they commune of laying snares privily ; they say , who shall see them ?
this man was instructed in the way of the lord ; and being fervent in the spirit , he spake and taught diligently the things of the lord , knowing only the baptism of john .
that they may shoot in secret at the perfect : suddenly do they shoot at him , and fear not .
for he mightily convinced the jews , and that publickly , shewing by the scriptures that jesus was christ .
then said abishai the son of zeruiah unto the king , why should this dead dog curse my lord the king ? let me go over , i pray thee , and take off his head .
and when he was disposed to pass into achaia , the brethren wrote , exhorting the disciples to receive him : who , when he was come , helped them much which had believed through grace :
if ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with jerubbaal and with his house this day , then rejoice ye in abimelech , and let him also rejoice in you :
and thus said shimei when he cursed , come out , come out , thou bloody man , and thou man of belial :
and ye are risen up against my father ' s house this day , and have slain his sons , threescore and ten persons , upon one stone , and have made abimelech , the son of his maidservant , king over the men of shechem , because he is your brother ; )
and all men shall fear , and shall declare the work of god ; for they shall wisely consider of his doing .
the lord hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of saul , in whose stead thou hast reigned ; and the lord hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of absalom thy son : and , behold , thou art taken in thy mischief , because thou art a bloody man .
( for my father fought for you , and adventured his life far , and delivered you out of the hand of midian :
so they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves : all that see them shall flee away .
then went abimelech to thebez , and encamped against thebez , and took it .
but there was a strong tower within the city , and thither fled all the men and women , and all they of the city , and shut it to them , and gat them up to the top of the tower .
and abimelech came unto the tower , and fought against it , and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire .
for who hath known the mind of the lord , that he may instruct him ? but we have the mind of christ .
and he took the people , and divided them into three companies , and laid wait in the field , and looked , and , behold , the people were come forth out of the city ; and he rose up against them , and smote them .
and it came to pass on the morrow , that the people went out into the field ; and they told abimelech .
and abimelech fought against the city all that day ; and he took the city , and slew the people that was therein , and beat down the city , and sowed it with salt .
but he that is spiritual judgeth all things , yet he himself is judged of no man .
and abimelech , and the company that was with him , rushed forward , and stood in the entering of the gate of the city : and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields , and slew them .
now we have received , not the spirit of the world , but the spirit which is of god ; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god .
and it was told abimelech , that all the men of the tower of shechem were gathered together .
which things also we speak , not in the words which man ' s wisdom teacheth , but which the holy ghost teacheth ; comparing spiritual things with spiritual .
and when all the men of the tower of shechem heard that , they entered into an hold of the house of the god berith .
but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit : for the spirit searcheth all things , yea , the deep things of god .
and all the people likewise cut down every man his bough , and followed abimelech , and put them to the hold , and set the hold on fire upon them ; so that all the men of the tower of shechem died also , about a thousand men and women .
for what man knoweth the things of a man , save the spirit of man which is in him ? even so the things of god knoweth no man , but the spirit of god .
for i am with thee , and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee : for i have much people in this city .
and he continued there a year and six months , teaching the word of god among them .
and these are they that conspired against him ; zabad the son of shimeath an ammonitess , and jehozabad the son of shimrith a moabitess .
now concerning his sons , and the greatness of the burdens laid upon him , and the repairing of the house of god , behold , they are written in the story of the book of the kings . and amaziah his son reigned in his stead .
thus joash the king remembered not the kindness which jehoiada his father had done to him , but slew his son . and when he died , he said , the lord look upon it , and require it .
and abimelech chased him , and he fled before him , and many were overthrown and wounded , even unto the entering of the gate .
and they conspired against him , and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the lord .
and abimelech dwelt at arumah : and zebul thrust out gaal and his brethren , that they should not dwell in shechem .
for the army of the syrians came with a small company of men , and the lord delivered a very great host into their hand , because they had forsaken the lord god of their fathers . so they executed judgment against joash .
and it came to pass at the end of the year , that the host of syria came up against him : and they came to judah and jerusalem , and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people , and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of damascus .
and abimelech rose up , and all the people that were with him , by night , and they laid wait against shechem in four companies .
and it shall be , that in the morning , as soon as the sun is up , thou shalt rise early , and set upon the city : and , behold , when he and the people that is with him come out against thee , then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion .
now therefore up by night , thou and the people that is with thee , and lie in wait in the field :
and he sent messengers unto abimelech privily , saying , behold , gaal the son of ebed and his brethren be come to shechem ; and , behold , they fortify the city against thee .
then said zebul unto him , where is now thy mouth , wherewith thou saidst , who is abimelech , that we should serve him ? is not this the people that thou hast despised ? go out , i pray now , and fight with them .
and gaal spake again and said , see there come people down by the middle of the land , and another company come along by the plain of meonenim .
and when gaal saw the people , he said to zebul , behold , there come people down from the top of the mountains . and zebul said unto him , thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men .
and gaal the son of ebed went out , and stood in the entering of the gate of the city : and abimelech rose up , and the people that were with him , from lying in wait .
and gaal went out before the men of shechem , and fought with abimelech .
they shall come with weeping , and with supplications will i lead them : i will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way , wherein they shall not stumble : for i am a father to israel , and ephraim is my firstborn .
for there shall be a day , that the watchmen upon the mount ephraim shall cry , arise ye , and let us go up to zion unto the lord our god .
thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of samaria : the planters shall plant , and shall eat them as common things .
behold , i will bring them from the north country , and gather them from the coasts of the earth , and with them the blind and the lame , the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together : a great company shall return thither .
for thus saith the lord ; sing with gladness for jacob , and shout among the chief of the nations : publish ye , praise ye , and say , o lord , save thy people , the remnant of israel .
thus saith the lord , the people which were left of the sword found grace in the wilderness ; even israel , when i went to cause him to rest .
at the same time , saith the lord , will i be the god of all the families of israel , and they shall be my people .
again i will build thee , and thou shalt be built , o virgin of israel : thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets , and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry .
and all the evil of the men of shechem did god render upon their heads : and upon them came the curse of jotham the son of jerubbaal .
and when the men of israel saw that abimelech was dead , they departed every man unto his place .
thus god rendered the wickedness of abimelech , which he did unto his father , in slaying his seventy brethren :
and a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon abimelech ' s head , and all to brake his skull .
then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer , and said unto him , draw thy sword , and slay me , that men say not of me , a woman slew him . and his young man thrust him through , and he died .
as for the likeness of their faces , they four had the face of a man , and the face of a lion , on the right side : and they four had the face of an ox on the left side ; they four also had the face of an eagle .
when they went , they went upon their four sides : and they turned not when they went .
the appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl : and they four had one likeness : and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel .
and when the living creatures went , the wheels went by them : and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth , the wheels were lifted up .
as for their rings , they were so high that they were dreadful ; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four .
as for the likeness of the living creatures , their appearance was like burning coals of fire , and like the appearance of lamps : it went up and down among the living creatures ; and the fire was bright , and out of the fire went forth lightning .
and they went every one straight forward : whither the spirit was to go , they went ; and they turned not when they went .
now as i beheld the living creatures , behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures , with his four faces .
and the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning .
let us not be desirous of vain glory , provoking one another , envying one another .
now to the one half of the tribe of manasseh moses had given possession in bashan : but unto the other half thereof gave joshua among their brethren on this side jordan westward . and when joshua sent them away also unto their tents , then he blessed them ,
if we live in the spirit , let us also walk in the spirit .
so joshua blessed them , and sent them away : and they went unto their tents .
and he spake unto them , saying , return with much riches unto your tents , and with very much cattle , with silver , and with gold , and with brass , and with iron , and with very much raiment : divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren .
but the fruit of the spirit is love , joy , peace , longsuffering , gentleness , goodness , faith ,
ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day , but have kept the charge of the commandment of the lord your god .
envyings , murders , drunkenness , revellings , and such like : of the which i tell you before , as i have also told you in time past , that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of god .
and said unto them , ye have kept all that moses the servant of the lord commanded you , and have obeyed my voice in all that i commanded you :
and they that are christ ' s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts .
meekness , temperance : against such there is no law .
and now the lord your god hath given rest unto your brethren , as he promised them : therefore now return ye , and get you unto your tents , and unto the land of your possession , which moses the servant of the lord gave you on the other side jordan .
and the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal , stretched forth over their heads above .
idolatry , witchcraft , hatred , variance , emulations , wrath , strife , seditions , heresies ,
when those went , these went ; and when those stood , these stood ; and when those were lifted up from the earth , the wheels were lifted up over against them : for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels .
whithersoever the spirit was to go , they went , thither was their spirit to go ; and the wheels were lifted up over against them : for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels .
and i saw as the colour of amber , as the appearance of fire round about within it , from the appearance of his loins even upward , and from the appearance of his loins even downward , i saw as it were the appearance of fire , and it had brightness round about .
and above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne , as the appearance of a sapphire stone : and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it .
and when they went , i heard the noise of their wings , like the noise of great waters , as the voice of the almighty , the voice of speech , as the noise of an host : when they stood , they let down their wings .
and under the firmament were their wings straight , the one toward the other : every one had two , which covered on this side , and every one had two , which covered on that side , their bodies .
now the works of the flesh are manifest , which are these ; adultery , fornication , uncleanness , lasciviousness ,
but if ye be led of the spirit , ye are not under the law .
for the flesh lusteth against the spirit , and the spirit against the flesh : and these are contrary the one to the other : so that ye cannot do the things that ye would .
this i say then , walk in the spirit , and ye shall not fulful the lust of the flesh .
but if ye bite and devour one another , take heed that ye be not consumed one of another .
for , brethren , ye have been called unto liberty ; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh , but by love serve one another .
and i , brethren , if i yet preach circumcision , why do i yet suffer persecution ? then is the offence of the cross ceased .
i have confidence in you through the lord , that ye will be none otherwise minded : but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment , whosoever he be .
and the tongue is a fire , a world of iniquity : so is the tongue among our members , that it defileth the whole body , and setteth on fire the course of nature ; and it is set on fire of hell .
even so the tongue is a little member , and boasteth great things . behold , how great a matter a little fire kindleth !
behold also the ships , which though they be so great , and are driven of fierce winds , yet are they turned about with a very small helm , whithersoever the governor listeth .
behold , we put bits in the horses ' mouths , that they may obey us ; and we turn about their whole body .
for in many things we offend all . if any man offend not in word , the same is a perfect man , and able also to bridle the whole body .
my brethren , be not many masters , knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation .
therewith bless we god , even the father ; and therewith curse we men , which are made after the similitude of god .
but the tongue can no man tame ; it is an unruly evil , full of deadly poison .
for every kind of beasts , and of birds , and of serpents , and of things in the sea , is tamed , and hath been tamed of mankind :
is any among you afflicted ? let him pray . is any merry ? let him sing psalms .
but above all things , my brethren , swear not , neither by heaven , neither by the earth , neither by any other oath : but let your yea be yea ; and your nay , nay ; lest ye fall into condemnation .
behold , we count them happy which endure . ye have heard of the patience of job , and have seen the end of the lord ; that the lord is very pitiful , and of tender mercy .
take , my brethren , the prophets , who have spoken in the name of the lord , for an example of suffering affliction , and of patience .
for many are called , but few are chosen .
then said the king to the servants , bind him hand and foot , and take him away , and cast him into outer darkness ; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
and he saith unto him , friend , how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment ? and he was speechless .
and when the king came in to see the guests , he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment :
so those servants went out into the highways , and gathered together all as many as they found , both bad and good : and the wedding was furnished with guests .
brethren , if any of you do err from the truth , and one convert him ;
and he prayed again , and the heaven gave rain , and the earth brought forth her fruit .
shew me the tribute money . and they brought unto him a penny .
and the prayer of faith shall save the sick , and the lord shall raise him up ; and if he have committed sins , they shall be forgiven him .
but jesus perceived their wickedness , and said , why tempt ye me , ye hypocrites ?
is any sick among you ? let him call for the elders of the church ; and let them pray over him , anointing him with oil in the name of the lord :
tell us therefore , what thinkest thou ? is it lawful to give tribute unto caesar , or not ?
elias was a man subject to like passions as we are , and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain : and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months .
and they sent out unto him their disciples with the herodians , saying , master , we know that thou art true , and teachest the way of god in truth , neither carest thou for any man : for thou regardest not the person of men .
confess your faults one to another , and pray one for another , that ye may be healed . the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much .
then went the pharisees , and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk .
the same day came to him the sadducees , which say that there is no resurrection , and asked him ,
when they had heard these words , they marvelled , and left him , and went their way .
now there were with us seven brethren : and the first , when he had married a wife , deceased , and , having no issue , left his wife unto his brother :
saying , master , moses said , if a man die , having no children , his brother shall marry his wife , and raise up seed unto his brother .
they say unto him , caesar ' s . then saith he unto them , render therefore unto caesar the things which are caesar ' s ; and unto god the things that are god ' s .
and he saith unto them , whose is this image and superscription ?
and last of all the woman died also .
likewise the second also , and the third , unto the seventh .
jesus answered and said unto them , ye do err , not knowing the scriptures , nor the power of god .
therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven ? for they all had her .
this is the portion of a wicked man from god , and the heritage appointed unto him by god .
all darkness shall be hid in his secret places : a fire not blown shall consume him ; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle .
it is drawn , and cometh out of the body ; yea , the glittering sword cometh out of his gall : terrors are upon him .
he shall flee from the iron weapon , and the bow of steel shall strike him through .
when he is about to fill his belly , god shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him , and shall rain it upon him while he is eating .
there shall none of his meat be left ; therefore shall no man look for his goods .
surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly , he shall not save of that which he desired .
he shall not see the rivers , the floods , the brooks of honey and butter .
he shall suck the poison of asps : the viper ' s tongue shall slay him .
because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor ; because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not ;
that which he laboured for shall he restore , and shall not swallow it down : according to his substance shall the restitution be , and he shall not rejoice therein .
his bones are full of the sin of his youth , which shall lie down with him in the dust .
his children shall seek to please the poor , and his hands shall restore their goods .
though he spare it , and forsake it not ; but keep it still within his mouth :
though wickedness be sweet in his mouth , though he hide it under his tongue ;
he hath swallowed down riches , and he shall vomit them up again : god shall cast them out of his belly .
yet his meat in his bowels is turned , it is the gall of asps within him .
and that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all , that ye say , we will be as the heathen , as the families of the countries , to serve wood and stone .
as i live , saith the lord god , surely with a mighty hand , and with a stretched out arm , and with fury poured out , will i rule over you :
and i will bring you out from the people , and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered , with a mighty hand , and with a stretched out arm , and with fury poured out .
wherefore say unto the house of israel , thus saith the lord god ; are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers ? and commit ye whoredom after their abominations ?
as for you , o house of israel , thus saith the lord god ; go ye , serve ye every one his idols , and hereafter also , if ye will not hearken unto me : but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts , and with your idols .
and i will bring you into the wilderness of the people , and there will i plead with you face to face .
like as i pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of egypt , so will i plead with you , saith the lord god .
and i will cause you to pass under the rod , and i will bring you into the bond of the covenant :
and i will purge out from among you the rebels , and them that transgress against me : i will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn , and they shall not enter into the land of israel : and ye shall know that i am the lord .
whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood .
for a testament is of force after men are dead : otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth .
for when moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law , he took the blood of calves and of goats , with water , and scarlet wool , and hyssop , and sprinkled both the book , and all the people ,
for if the blood of bulls and of goats , and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean , sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh :
and ye shall know that i am the lord , when i have wrought with you for my name ' s sake , not according to your wicked ways , nor according to your corrupt doings , o ye house of israel , saith the lord god .
how much more shall the blood of christ , who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god , purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god ?
moreover the word of the lord came unto me , saying ,
and for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament , that by means of death , for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament , they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance .
and ye shall know that i am the lord , when i shall bring you into the land of israel , into the country for the which i lifted up mine hand to give it to your fathers .
for where a testament is , there must also of necessity be the death of the testator .
and there shall ye remember your ways , and all your doings , wherein ye have been defiled ; and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed .
which stood only in meats and drinks , and divers washings , and carnal ordinances , imposed on them until the time of reformation .
i will accept you with your sweet savour , when i bring you out from the people , and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered ; and i will be sanctified in you before the heathen .
but christ being come an high priest of good things to come , by a greater and more perfect tabernacle , not made with hands , that is to say , not of this building ;
neither by the blood of goats and calves , but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place , having obtained eternal redemption for us .
and all flesh shall see that i the lord have kindled it : it shall not be quenched .
then said i , ah lord god ! they say of me , doth he not speak parables ?
son of man , set thy face toward the south , and drop thy word toward the south , and prophesy against the forest of the south field ;
so jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger , and did eat no meat the second day of the month : for he was grieved for david , because his father had done him shame .
if any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven , from thence will the lord thy god gather thee , and from thence will he fetch thee :
that then the lord thy god will turn thy captivity , and have compassion upon thee , and will return and gather thee from all the nations , whither the lord thy god hath scattered thee .
and jonathan answered saul his father , and said unto him , wherefore shall he be slain ? what hath he done ?
and the lord thy god will circumcise thine heart , and the heart of thy seed , to love the lord thy god with all thine heart , and with all thy soul , that thou mayest live .
and saul cast a javelin at him to smite him : whereby jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay david .
and the lord thy god will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed , and thou shalt possess it ; and he will do thee good , and multiply thee above thy fathers .
then saul ' s anger was kindled against jonathan , and he said unto him , thou son of the perverse rebellious woman , do not i know that thou hast chosen the son of jesse to thine own confusion , and unto the confusion of thy mother ' s nakedness ?
and thou shalt return and obey the voice of the lord , and do all his commandments which i command thee this day .
for as long as the son of jesse liveth upon the ground , thou shalt not be established , nor thy kingdom . wherefore now send and fetch him unto me , for he shall surely die .
and the lord thy god will put all these curses upon thine enemies , and on them that hate thee , which persecuted thee .
and the lord thy god will make thee plenteous in every work of thine hand , in the fruit of thy body , and in the fruit of thy cattle , and in the fruit of thy land , for good : for the lord will again rejoice over thee for good , as he rejoiced over thy fathers :
and he said unto his lad , run , find out now the arrows which i shoot . and as the lad ran , he shot an arrow beyond him .
and shalt return unto the lord thy god , and shalt obey his voice according to all that i command thee this day , thou and thy children , with all thine heart , and with all thy soul ;
and when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which jonathan had shot , jonathan cried after the lad , and said , is not the arrow beyond thee ?
so will i make my holy name known in the midst of my people israel ; and i will not let them pollute my holy name any more : and the heathen shall know that i am the lord , the holy one in israel .
wherefore i caused them to go forth out of the land of egypt , and brought them into the wilderness .
and i will send a fire on magog , and among them that dwell carelessly in the isles : and they shall know that i am the lord .
and i gave them my statutes , and shewed them my judgments , which if a man do , he shall even live in them .
and they that dwell in the cities of israel shall go forth , and shall set on fire and burn the weapons , both the shields and the bucklers , the bows and the arrows , and the handstaves , and the spears , and they shall burn them with fire seven years :
moreover also i gave them my sabbaths , to be a sign between me and them , that they might know that i am the lord that sanctify them .
behold , it is come , and it is done , saith the lord god ; this is the day whereof i have spoken .
and i will smite thy bow out of thy left hand , and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand .
but i wrought for my name ' s sake , that it should not be polluted before the heathen , in whose sight i brought them out .
and i will turn thee back , and leave but the sixth part of thee , and will cause thee to come up from the north parts , and will bring thee upon the mountains of israel :
yet also i lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness , that i would not bring them into the land which i had given them , flowing with milk and honey , which is the glory of all lands ;
thou shalt fall upon the open field : for i have spoken it , saith the lord god .
because they despised my judgments , and walked not in my statutes , but polluted my sabbaths : for their heart went after their idols .
thou shalt fall upon the mountains of israel , thou , and all thy bands , and the people that is with thee : i will give thee unto the ravenous birds of every sort , and to the beasts of the field to be devoured .
nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them , neither did i make an end of them in the wilderness .
i am the lord your god ; walk in my statutes , and keep my judgments , and do them ;
therefore , thou son of man , prophesy against gog , and say , thus saith the lord god ; behold , i am against thee , o gog , the chief prince of meshech and tubal :
and jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad , and said unto him , go , carry them to the city .
and as soon as the lad was gone , david arose out of a place toward the south , and fell on his face to the ground , and bowed himself three times : and they kissed one another , and wept one with another , until david exceeded .
and jonathan said to david , go in peace , forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the lord , saying , the lord be between me and thee , and between my seed and thy seed for ever . and he arose and departed : and jonathan went into the city .
but if he wash them not , nor bathe his flesh ; then he shall bear his iniquity .
there are the workers of iniquity fallen : they are cast down , and shall not be able to rise .
therefore i said unto the children of israel , no soul of you shall eat blood , neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood .
o continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee ; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart .
and whatsoever man there be of the children of israel , or of the strangers that sojourn among you , which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten ; he shall even pour out the blood thereof , and cover it with dust .
let not the foot of pride come against me , and let not the hand of the wicked remove me .
for it is the life of all flesh ; the blood of it is for the life thereof : therefore i said unto the children of israel , ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh : for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof : whosoever eateth it shall be cut off .
and every soul that eateth that which died of itself , or that which was torn with beasts , whether it be one of your own country , or a stranger , he shall both wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even : then shall he be clean .
nevertheless i withdrew mine hand , and wrought for my name ' s sake , that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen , in whose sight i brought them forth .
i lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness , that i would scatter them among the heathen , and disperse them through the countries ;
and whatsoever man there be of the house of israel , or of the strangers that sojourn among you , that eateth any manner of blood ; i will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood , and will cut him off from among his people .
and hallow my sabbaths ; and they shall be a sign between me and you , that ye may know that i am the lord your god .
for the life of the flesh is in the blood : and i have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls : for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul .
and i polluted them in their own gifts , in that they caused to pass through the fire all that openeth the womb , that i might make them desolate , to the end that they might know that i am the lord .
therefore , son of man , speak unto the house of israel , and say unto them , thus saith the lord god ; yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me , in that they have committed a trespass against me .
because they had not executed my judgments , but had despised my statutes , and had polluted my sabbaths , and their eyes were after their fathers ' idols .
wherefore i gave them also statutes that were not good , and judgments whereby they should not live ;
save only that which the young men have eaten , and the portion of the men which went with me , aner , eshcol , and mamre ; let them take their portion .
that i will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet , and that i will not take any thing that is thine , lest thou shouldest say , i have made abram rich :
and abram said to the king of sodom , i have lift up mine hand unto the lord , the most high god , the possessor of heaven and earth ,
and the king of sodom said unto abram , give me the persons , and take the goods to thyself .
and upon all the high mountains , and upon all the hills that are lifted up ,
and upon every high tower , and upon every fenced wall ,
for the day of the lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty , and upon every one that is lifted up ; and he shall be brought low :
and upon all the cedars of lebanon , that are high and lifted up , and upon all the oaks of bashan ,
and the idols he shall utterly abolish .
and they shall go into the holes of the rocks , and into the caves of the earth , for fear of the lord , and for the glory of his majesty , when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth .
and upon all the ships of tarshish , and upon all pleasant pictures .
and the loftiness of man shall be bowed down , and the haughtiness of men shall be made low : and the lord alone shall be exalted in that day .
cease ye from man , whose breath is in his nostrils : for wherein is he to be accounted of ?
to go into the clefts of the rocks , and into the tops of the ragged rocks , for fear of the lord , and for the glory of his majesty , when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth .
in that day a man shall cast his idols of silver , and his idols of gold , which they made each one for himself to worship , to the moles and to the bats ;
and they took all the goods of sodom and gomorrah , and all their victuals , and went their way .
and the vale of siddim was full of slimepits ; and the kings of sodom and gomorrah fled , and fell there ; and they that remained fled to the mountain .
and there came one that had escaped , and told abram the hebrew ; for he dwelt in the plain of mamre the amorite , brother of eschol , and brother of aner : and these were confederate with abram .
and they took lot , abram ' s brother ' s son , who dwelt in sodom , and his goods , and departed .
and he divided himself against them , he and his servants , by night , and smote them , and pursued them unto hobah , which is on the left hand of damascus .
and when abram heard that his brother was taken captive , he armed his trained servants , born in his own house , three hundred and eighteen , and pursued them unto dan .
and the king of sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of chedorlaomer , and of the kings that were with him , at the valley of shaveh , which is the king ' s dale .
and he brought back all the goods , and also brought again his brother lot , and his goods , and the women also , and the people .
and he blessed him , and said , blessed be abram of the most high god , possessor of heaven and earth :
and melchizedek king of salem brought forth bread and wine : and he was the priest of the most high god .
the lofty looks of man shall be humbled , and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down , and the lord alone shall be exalted in that day .
and blessed be the most high god , which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand . and he gave him tithes of all .
for her sins have reached unto heaven , and god hath remembered her iniquities .
and i heard another voice from heaven , saying , come out of her , my people , that ye be not partakers of her sins , and that ye receive not of her plagues .
how much she hath glorified herself , and lived deliciously , so much torment and sorrow give her : for she saith in her heart , i sit a queen , and am no widow , and shall see no sorrow .
so christ was once offered to bear the sins of many ; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation .
reward her even as she rewarded you , and double unto her double according to her works : in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double .
and after these things i saw another angel come down from heaven , having great power ; and the earth was lightened with his glory .
for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication , and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her , and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies .
and he cried mightily with a strong voice , saying , babylon the great is fallen , is fallen , and is become the habitation of devils , and the hold of every foul spirit , and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird .
and the kings of the earth , who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her , shall bewail her , and lament for her , when they shall see the smoke of her burning ,
therefore shall her plagues come in one day , death , and mourning , and famine ; and she shall be utterly burned with fire : for strong is the lord god who judgeth her .
it was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these ; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these .
and almost all things are by the law purged with blood ; and without shedding of blood is no remission .
moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle , and all the vessels of the ministry .
saying , this is the blood of the testament which god hath enjoined unto you .
and as it is appointed unto men once to die , but after this the judgment :
for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world : but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself .
nor yet that he should offer himself often , as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others ;
for christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands , which are the figures of the true ; but into heaven itself , now to appear in the presence of god for us :
and if he have betrothed her unto his son , he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters .
now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them .
if thou buy an hebrew servant , six years he shall serve : and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing .
if he came in by himself , he shall go out by himself : if he were married , then his wife shall go out with him .
if his master have given him a wife , and she have born him sons or daughters ; the wife and her children shall be her master ' s , and he shall go out by himself .
and if the servant shall plainly say , i love my master , my wife , and my children ; i will not go out free :
then his master shall bring him unto the judges ; he shall also bring him to the door , or unto the door post ; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul ; and he shall serve him for ever .
and if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant , she shall not go out as the menservants do .
if she please not her master , who hath betrothed her to himself , then shall he let her be redeemed : to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power , seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her .
and they said unto him , where wilt thou that we prepare ?
and he sent peter and john , saying , go and prepare us the passover , that we may eat .
then came the day of unleavened bread , when the passover must be killed .
and he promised , and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude .
now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh , which is called the passover .
and the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him ; for they feared the people .
then entered satan into judas surnamed iscariot , being of the number of the twelve .
and he went his way , and communed with the chief priests and captains , how he might betray him unto them .
and they were glad , and covenanted to give him money .
i will say unto god my rock , why hast thou forgotten me ? why go i mourning because of the oppression of the enemy ?
yet the lord will command his lovingkindness in the daytime , and in the night his song shall be with me , and my prayer unto the god of my life .
deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts : all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me .
o my god , my soul is cast down within me : therefore will i remember thee from the land of jordan , and of the hermonites , from the hill mizar .
why art thou cast down , o my soul ? and why art thou disquieted in me ? hope thou in god : for i shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance .
when i remember these things , i pour out my soul in me : for i had gone with the multitude , i went with them to the house of god , with the voice of joy and praise , with a multitude that kept holyday .
and he said , it is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of jacob , and to restore the preserved of israel : i will also give thee for a light to the gentiles , that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth .
thus saith the lord , in an acceptable time have i heard thee , and in a day of salvation have i helped thee : and i will preserve thee , and give thee for a covenant of the people , to establish the earth , to cause to inherit the desolate heritages ;
that thou mayest say to the prisoners , go forth ; to them that are in darkness , shew yourselves . they shall feed in the ways , and their pastures shall be in all high places .
as the hart panteth after the water brooks , so panteth my soul after thee , o god .
my soul thirsteth for god , for the living god : when shall i come and appear before god ?
my tears have been my meat day and night , while they continually say unto me , where is thy god ?
listen , o isles , unto me ; and hearken , ye people , from far ; the lord hath called me from the womb ; from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name .
and said unto me , thou art my servant , o israel , in whom i will be glorified .
and he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword ; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me , and made me a polished shaft ; in his quiver hath he hid me ;
and now , saith the lord that formed me from the womb to be his servant , to bring jacob again to him , though israel be not gathered , yet shall i be glorious in the eyes of the lord , and my god shall be my strength .
then i said , i have laboured in vain , i have spent my strength for nought , and in vain : yet surely my judgment is with the lord , and my work with my god .
the third to zaccur , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
the fourth to izri , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
the eleventh to azareel , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
in the second year of darius the king , in the sixth month , in the first day of the month , came the word of the lord by haggai the prophet unto zerubbabel the son of shealtiel , governor of judah , and to joshua the son of josedech , the high priest , saying ,
the twelfth to hashabiah , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
thus speaketh the lord of hosts , saying , this people say , the time is not come , the time that the lord ' s house should be built .
the ninth to mattaniah , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
then came the word of the lord by haggai the prophet , saying ,
the tenth to shimei , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
is it time for you , o ye , to dwell in your cieled houses , and this house lie waste ?
the seventh to jesharelah , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
now therefore thus saith the lord of hosts ; consider your ways .
the eighth to jeshaiah , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
ye have sown much , and bring in little ; ye eat , but ye have not enough ; ye drink , but ye are not filled with drink ; ye clothe you , but there is none warm ; and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes .
the fifth to nethaniah , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
thus saith the lord of hosts ; consider your ways .
the sixth to bukkiah , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
go up to the mountain , and bring wood , and build the house ; and i will take pleasure in it , and i will be glorified , saith the lord .
but also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever : no , not when the lord hath cut off the enemies of david every one from the face of the earth .
and thou shalt not only while yet i live shew me the kindness of the lord , that i die not :
ye looked for much , and , lo , it came to little ; and when ye brought it home , i did blow upon it . why ? saith the lord of hosts . because of mine house that is waste , and ye run every man unto his own house .
and jonathan caused david to swear again , because he loved him : for he loved him as he loved his own soul .
so jonathan made a covenant with the house of david , saying , let the lord even require it at the hand of david ' s enemies .
and when thou hast stayed three days , then thou shalt go down quickly , and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand , and shalt remain by the stone ezel .
then jonathan said to david , to morrow is the new moon : and thou shalt be missed , because thy seat will be empty .
and jonathan said unto david , come , and let us go out into the field . and they went out both of them into the field .
then said david to jonathan , who shall tell me ? or what if thy father answer thee roughly ?
and jonathan said unto david , o lord god of israel , when i have sounded my father about to morrow any time , or the third day , and , behold , if there be good toward david , and i then send not unto thee , and shew it thee ;
the thirteenth to shubael , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
the fourteenth to mattithiah , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
the fifteenth to jeremoth , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
the twentieth to eliathah , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
the one and twentieth to hothir , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
the two and twentieth to giddalti , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
the sixteenth to hananiah , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
the seventeenth to joshbekashah , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
the eighteenth to hanani , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
the nineteenth to mallothi , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
and jonathan answered saul , david earnestly asked leave of me to go to bethlehem :
and it came to pass on the morrow , which was the second day of the month , that david ' s place was empty : and saul said unto jonathan his son , wherefore cometh not the son of jesse to meat , neither yesterday , nor to day ?
nevertheless saul spake not any thing that day : for he thought , something hath befallen him , he is not clean ; surely he is not clean .
and the king sat upon his seat , as at other times , even upon a seat by the wall : and jonathan arose , and abner sat by saul ' s side , and david ' s place was empty .
and i will shoot three arrows on the side thereof , as though i shot at a mark .
so david hid himself in the field : and when the new moon was come , the king sat him down to eat meat .
and as touching the matter which thou and i have spoken of , behold , the lord be between thee and me for ever .
but if i say thus unto the young man , behold , the arrows are beyond thee ; go thy way : for the lord hath sent thee away .
and he shall bring upon them their own iniquity , and shall cut them off in their own wickedness ; yea , the lord our god shall cut them off .
the three and twentieth to mahazioth , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve :
the four and twentieth to romamti - ezer , he , his sons , and his brethren , were twelve .
shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee , which frameth mischief by a law ?
but the lord is my defence ; and my god is the rock of my refuge .
they gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous , and condemn the innocent blood .
he cometh forth like a flower , and is cut down : he fleeth also as a shadow , and continueth not .
and dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one , and bringest me into judgment with thee ?
who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean ? not one .
seeing his days are determined , the number of his months are with thee , thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass ;
man that is born of a woman is of few days , and full of trouble .
turn from him , that he may rest , till he shall accomplish , as an hireling , his day .
for there is hope of a tree , if it be cut down , that it will sprout again , and that the tender branch thereof will not cease .
though the root thereof wax old in the earth , and the stock thereof die in the ground ;
yet through the scent of water it will bud , and bring forth boughs like a plant .
to see thy power and thy glory , so as i have seen thee in the sanctuary .
o god , thou art my god ; early will i seek thee : my soul thirsteth for thee , my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land , where no water is ;
thus will i bless thee while i live : i will lift up my hands in thy name .
because thy lovingkindness is better than life , my lips shall praise thee .
but those that seek my soul , to destroy it , shall go into the lower parts of the earth .
because thou hast been my help , therefore in the shadow of thy wings will i rejoice .
my soul followeth hard after thee : thy right hand upholdeth me .
my soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness ; and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips :
for i delight in the law of god after the inward man :
i find then a law , that , when i would do good , evil is present with me .
o wretched man that i am ! who shall deliver me from the body of this death ?
but i see another law in my members , warring against the law of my mind , and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members .
in what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet , resort ye thither unto us : our god shall fight for us .
likewise at the same time said i unto the people , let every one with his servant lodge within jerusalem , that in the night they may be a guard to us , and labour on the day .
so we laboured in the work : and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared .
so neither i , nor my brethren , nor my servants , nor the men of the guard which followed me , none of us put off our clothes , saving that every one put them off for washing .
was then that which is good made death unto me ? god forbid . but sin , that it might appear sin , working death in me by that which is good ; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful .
wherefore the law is holy , and the commandment holy , and just , and good .
for sin , taking occasion by the commandment , deceived me , and by it slew me .
and the commandment , which was ordained to life , i found to be unto death .
now then it is no more i that do it , but sin that dwelleth in me .
if then i do that which i would not , i consent unto the law that it is good .
for that which i do i allow not : for what i would , that do i not ; but what i hate , that do i .
for we know that the law is spiritual : but i am carnal , sold under sin .
for the good that i would i do not : but the evil which i would not , that i do .
for i know that in me ( that is , in my flesh , ) dwelleth no good thing : for to will is present with me ; but how to perform that which is good i find not .
and i said unto the nobles , and to the rulers , and to the rest of the people , the work is great and large , and we are separated upon the wall , one far from another .
for the builders , every one had his sword girded by his side , and so builded . and he that sounded the trumpet was by me .
they which builded on the wall , and they that bare burdens , with those that laded , every one with one of his hands wrought in the work , and with the other hand held a weapon .
and it came to pass from that time forth , that the half of my servants wrought in the work , and the other half of them held both the spears , the shields , and the bows , and the habergeons ; and the rulers were behind all the house of judah .
and our adversaries said , they shall not know , neither see , till we come in the midst among them , and slay them , and cause the work to cease .
and judah said , the strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed , and there is much rubbish ; so that we are not able to build the wall .
and it came to pass , when our enemies heard that it was known unto us , and god had brought their counsel to nought , that we returned all of us to the wall , every one unto his work .
now if i do that i would not , it is no more i that do it , but sin that dwelleth in me .
therefore set i in the lower places behind the wall , and on the higher places , i even set the people after their families with their swords , their spears , and their bows .
and it came to pass , that when the jews which dwelt by them came , they said unto us ten times , from all places whence ye shall return unto us they will be upon you .
shall a man make gods unto himself , and they are no gods ?
therefore , behold , i will this once cause them to know , i will cause them to know mine hand and my might ; and they shall know that my name is the lord .
and it shall come to pass , when thou shalt shew this people all these words , and they shall say unto thee , wherefore hath the lord pronounced all this great evil against us ? or what is our iniquity ? or what is our sin that we have committed against the lord our god ?
and ye have done worse than your fathers ; for , behold , ye walk every one after the imagination of his evil heart , that they may not hearken unto me :
therefore will i cast you out of this land into a land that ye know not , neither ye nor your fathers ; and there shall ye serve other gods day and night ; where i will not shew you favour .
therefore , behold , the days come , saith the lord , that it shall no more be said , the lord liveth , that brought up the children of israel out of the land of egypt ;
but , the lord liveth , that brought up the children of israel from the land of the north , and from all the lands whither he had driven them : and i will bring them again into their land that i gave unto their fathers .
behold , i will send for many fishers , saith the lord , and they shall fish them ; and after will i send for many hunters , and they shall hunt them from every mountain , and from every hill , and out of the holes of the rocks .
for mine eyes are upon all their ways : they are not hid from my face , neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes .
and first i will recompense their iniquity and their sin double ; because they have defiled my land , they have filled mine inheritance with the carcases of their detestable and abominable things .
o lord , my strength , and my fortress , and my refuge in the day of affliction , the gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of the earth , and shall say , surely our fathers have inherited lies , vanity , and things wherein there is no profit .
that thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity , until the pit be digged for the wicked .
for the lord will not cast off his people , neither will he forsake his inheritance .
but judgment shall return unto righteousness : and all the upright in heart shall follow it .
who will rise up for me against the evildoers ? or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity ?
unless the lord had been my help , my soul had almost dwelt in silence .
when i said , my foot slippeth ; thy mercy , o lord , held me up .
in the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul .
he that chastiseth the heathen , shall not he correct ? he that teacheth man knowledge , shall not he know ?
the lord knoweth the thoughts of man , that they are vanity .
he rebuketh the sea , and maketh it dry , and drieth up all the rivers : bashan languisheth , and carmel , and the flower of lebanon languisheth .
the mountains quake at him , and the hills melt , and the earth is burned at his presence , yea , the world , and all that dwell therein .
god is jealous , and the lord revengeth ; the lord revengeth , and is furious ; the lord will take vengeance on his adversaries , and he reserveth wrath for his enemies .
the lord is slow to anger , and great in power , and will not at all acquit the wicked : the lord hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm , and the clouds are the dust of his feet .
but with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof , and darkness shall pursue his enemies .
what do ye imagine against the lord ? he will make an utter end : affliction shall not rise up the second time .
who can stand before his indignation ? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger ? his fury is poured out like fire , and the rocks are thrown down by him .
the burden of nineveh . the book of the vision of nahum the elkoshite .
and the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits , and after wizards , to go a whoring after them , i will even set my face against that soul , and will cut him off from among his people .
then i will set my face against that man , and against his family , and will cut him off , and all that go a whoring after him , to commit whoredom with molech , from among their people .
and if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man , when he giveth of his seed unto molech , and kill him not :
what time she lifteth up herself on high , she scorneth the horse and his rider .
for every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death : he hath cursed his father or his mother ; his blood shall be upon him .
hast thou given the horse strength ? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder ?
and ye shall keep my statutes , and do them : i am the lord which sanctify you .
she is hardened against her young ones , as though they were not hers : her labour is in vain without fear ;
sanctify yourselves therefore , and be ye holy : for i am the lord your god .
because god hath deprived her of wisdom , neither hath he imparted to her understanding .
and forgetteth that the foot may crush them , or that the wild beast may break them .
which leaveth her eggs in the earth , and warmeth them in dust ,
gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks ? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich ?
wilt thou believe him , that he will bring home thy seed , and gather it into thy barn ?
wilt thou trust him , because his strength is great ? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him ?
canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow ? or will he harrow the valleys after thee ?
where are the gods of hamath and arphad ? where are the gods of sepharvaim ? and have they delivered samaria out of my hand ?
doth the eagle mount up at thy command , and make her nest on high ?
she dwelleth and abideth on the rock , upon the crag of the rock , and the strong place .
from thence she seeketh the prey , and her eyes behold afar off .
he swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage : neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet .
the quiver rattleth against him , the glittering spear and the shield .
and am i now come up without the lord against this land to destroy it ? the lord said unto me , go up against this land , and destroy it .
doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom , and stretch her wings toward the south ?
he saith among the trumpets , ha , ha ; and he smelleth the battle afar off , the thunder of the captains , and the shouting .
canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper ? the glory of his nostrils is terrible .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
he mocketh at fear , and is not affrighted ; neither turneth he back from the sword .
again , thou shalt say to the children of israel , whosoever he be of the children of israel , or of the strangers that sojourn in israel , that giveth any of his seed unto molech ; he shall surely be put to death : the people of the land shall stone him with stones .
he paweth in the valley , and rejoiceth in his strength : he goeth on to meet the armed men .
until i come and take you away to a land like your own land , a land of corn and wine , a land of bread and vineyards .
beware lest hezekiah persuade you , saying , the lord will deliver us . hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of assyria ?
neither let hezekiah make you trust in the lord , saying , the lord will surely deliver us : this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of assyria .
hearken not to hezekiah : for thus saith the king of assyria , make an agreement with me by a present , and come out to me : and eat ye every one of his vine , and every one of his fig tree , and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern ;
then rabshakeh stood , and cried with a loud voice in the jews ' language , and said , hear ye the words of the great king , the king of assyria .
thus saith the king , let not hezekiah deceive you : for he shall not be able to deliver you .
then said eliakim and shebna and joah unto rabshakeh , speak , i pray thee , unto thy servants in the syrian language ; for we understand it : and speak not to us in the jews ' language , in the ears of the people that are on the wall .
but rabshakeh said , hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words ? hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall , that they may eat their own dung , and drink their own piss with you ?
her young ones also suck up blood : and where the slain are , there is she .
who are they among all the gods of these lands , that have delivered their land out of my hand , that the lord should deliver jerusalem out of my hand ?
but they held their peace , and answered him not a word : for the king ' s commandment was , saying , answer him not .
then came eliakim , the son of hilkiah , that was over the household , and shebna the scribe , and joah , the son of asaph , the recorder , to hezekiah with their clothes rent , and told him the words of rabshakeh .
and say unto them , thus saith the lord of hosts , the god of israel ; behold , i will send and take nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon , my servant , and will set his throne upon these stones that i have hid ; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them .
and i will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of egypt ; and he shall burn them , and carry them away captives : and he shall array himself with the land of egypt , as a shepherd putteth on his garment ; and he shall go forth from thence in peace .
and when he cometh , he shall smite the land of egypt , and deliver such as are for death to death ; and such as are for captivity to captivity ; and such as are for the sword to the sword .
he shall break also the images of beth - shemesh , that is in the land of egypt ; and the houses of the gods of the egyptians shall he burn with fire .
only the trees which thou knowest that they be not trees for meat , thou shalt destroy and cut them down ; and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee , until it be subdued .
in the twilight , in the evening , in the black and dark night :
passing through the street near her corner ; and he went the way to her house ,
and beheld among the simple ones , i discerned among the youths , a young man void of understanding ,
for at the window of my house i looked through my casement ,
that they may keep thee from the strange woman , from the stranger which flattereth with her words .
say unto wisdom , thou art my sister ; and call understanding thy kinswoman :
keep my commandments , and live ; and my law as the apple of thine eye .
bind them upon thy fingers , write them upon the table of thine heart .
my son , keep my words , and lay up my commandments with thee .
and if it will make no peace with thee , but will make war against thee , then thou shalt besiege it :
and it shall be , if it make thee answer of peace , and open unto thee , then it shall be , that all the people that is found therein shall be tributaries unto thee , and they shall serve thee .
when thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it , then proclaim peace unto it .
but of the cities of these people , which the lord thy god doth give thee for an inheritance , thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth :
thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee , which are not of the cities of these nations .
but the women , and the little ones , and the cattle , and all that is in the city , even all the spoil thereof , shalt thou take unto thyself ; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies , which the lord thy god hath given thee .
and when the lord thy god hath delivered it into thine hands , thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword :
yea , he loved the people ; all his saints are in thy hand : and they sat down at thy feet ; every one shall receive of thy words .
and he said , the lord came from sinai , and rose up from seir unto them ; he shined forth from mount paran , and he came with ten thousands of saints : from his right hand went a fiery law for them .
and this is the blessing , wherewith moses the man of god blessed the children of israel before his death .
and this is the blessing of judah : and he said , hear , lord , the voice of judah , and bring him unto his people : let his hands be sufficient for him ; and be thou an help to him from his enemies .
let reuben live , and not die ; and let not his men be few .
and he was king in jeshurun , when the heads of the people and the tribes of israel were gathered together .
moses commanded us a law , even the inheritance of the congregation of jacob .
and of levi he said , let thy thummim and thy urim be with thy holy one , whom thou didst prove at massah , and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of meribah ;
who said unto his father and to his mother , i have not seen him ; neither did he acknowledge his brethren , nor knew his own children : for they have observed thy word , and kept thy covenant .
but thou shalt utterly destroy them ; namely , the hittites , and the amorites , the canaanites , and the perizzites , the hivites , and the jebusites ; as the lord thy god hath commanded thee :
that they teach you not to do after all their abominations , which they have done unto their gods ; so should ye sin against the lord your god .
thou art snared with the words of thy mouth , thou art taken with the words of thy mouth .
my son , if thou be surety for thy friend , if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger ,
give not sleep to thine eyes , nor slumber to thine eyelids .
do this now , my son , deliver thyself , when thou art come into the hand of thy friend ; go , humble thyself , and make sure thy friend .
i am a stranger in the earth : hide not thy commandments from me .
deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter , and as a bird from the hand of the fowler .
go to the ant , thou sluggard ; consider her ways , and be wise :
which having no guide , overseer , or ruler ,
provideth her meat in the summer , and gathereth her food in the harvest .
with my whole heart have i sought thee : o let me not wander from thy commandments .
thy word have i hid in mine heart , that i might not sin against thee .
blessed art thou , o lord : teach me thy statutes .
with my lips have i declared all the judgments of thy mouth .
i have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies , as much as in all riches .
i will meditate in thy precepts , and have respect unto thy ways .
deal bountifully with thy servant , that i may live , and keep thy word .
and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen , clean and white : for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints .
let us be glad and rejoice , and give honour to him : for the marriage of the lamb is come , and his wife hath made herself ready .
and he saith unto me , write , blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb . and he saith unto me , these are the true sayings of god .
for true and righteous are his judgments : for he hath judged the great whore , which did corrupt the earth with her fornication , and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand .
and after these things i heard a great voice of much people in heaven , saying , alleluia ; salvation , and glory , and honour , and power , unto the lord our god :
and the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped god that sat on the throne , saying , amen ; alleluia .
and again they said , alleluia . and her smoke rose up for ever and ever .
and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude , and as the voice of many waters , and as the voice of mighty thunderings , saying , alleluia : for the lord god omnipotent reigneth .
and a voice came out of the throne , saying , praise our god , all ye his servants , and ye that fear him , both small and great .
and moses wrote all the words of the lord , and rose up early in the morning , and builded an altar under the hill , and twelve pillars , according to the twelve tribes of israel .
and he sent young men of the children of israel , which offered burnt offerings , and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the lord .
and moses alone shall come near the lord : but they shall not come nigh ; neither shall the people go up with him .
and moses came and told the people all the words of the lord , and all the judgments : and all the people answered with one voice , and said , all the words which the lord hath said will we do .
for thus saith the lord , thy bruise is incurable , and thy wound is grievous .
and he said unto moses , come up unto the lord , thou , and aaron , nadab , and abihu , and seventy of the elders of israel ; and worship ye afar off .
for i am with thee , saith the lord , to save thee : though i make a full end of all nations whither i have scattered thee , yet will i not make a full end of thee : but i will correct thee in measure , and will not leave thee altogether unpunished .
so jehu rode in a chariot , and went to jezreel ; for joram lay there . and ahaziah king of judah was come down to see joram .
and there stood a watchman on the tower in jezreel , and he spied the company of jehu as he came , and said , i see a company . and joram said , take an horseman , and send to meet them , and let him say , is it peace ?
so there went one on horseback to meet him , and said , thus saith the king , is it peace ? and jehu said , what hast thou to do with peace ? turn thee behind me . and the watchman told , saying , the messenger came to them , but he cometh not again .
then he sent out a second on horseback , which came to them , and said , thus saith the king , is it peace ? and jehu answered , what hast thou to do with peace ? turn thee behind me .
and they said , it is false ; tell us now . and he said , thus and thus spake he to me , saying , thus saith the lord , i have anointed thee king over israel .
and moses took the blood , and sprinkled it on the people , and said , behold the blood of the covenant , which the lord hath made with you concerning all these words .
let thy mercies come also unto me , o lord , even thy salvation , according to thy word .
then they hasted , and took every man his garment , and put it under him on the top of the stairs , and blew with trumpets , saying , jehu is king .
then went up moses , and aaron , nadab , and abihu , and seventy of the elders of israel :
so shall i have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me : for i trust in thy word .
so jehu the son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi conspired against joram . ( now joram had kept ramoth - gilead , he and all israel , because of hazael king of syria .
and moses took half of the blood , and put it in basons ; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar .
but king joram was returned to be healed in jezreel of the wounds which the syrians had given him , when he fought with hazael king of syria . ) and jehu said , if it be your minds , then let none go forth nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in jezreel .
and he took the book of the covenant , and read in the audience of the people : and they said , all that the lord hath said will we do , and be obedient .
behold , i have longed after thy precepts : quicken me in thy righteousness .
i will speak of thy testimonies also before kings , and will not be ashamed .
and i will walk at liberty : for i seek thy precepts .
and it came to pass , when joram saw jehu , that he said , is it peace , jehu ? and he answered , what peace , so long as the whoredoms of thy mother jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many ?
so shall i keep thy law continually for ever and ever .
and joram said , make ready . and his chariot was made ready . and joram king of israel and ahaziah king of judah went out , each in his chariot , and they went out against jehu , and met him in the portion of naboth the jezreelite .
and take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth ; for i have hoped in thy judgments .
remember the word unto thy servant , upon which thou hast caused me to hope .
my hands also will i lift up unto thy commandments , which i have loved ; and i will meditate in thy statutes .
and i will delight myself in thy commandments , which i have loved .
why criest thou for thine affliction ? thy sorrow is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity : because thy sins were increased , i have done these things unto thee .
therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured ; and all thine adversaries , every one of them , shall go into captivity ; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil , and all that prey upon thee will i give for a prey .
there is none to plead thy cause , that thou mayest be bound up : thou hast no healing medicines .
all thy lovers have forgotten thee ; they seek thee not ; for i have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy , with the chastisement of a cruel one , for the multitude of thine iniquity ; because thy sins were increased .
and out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry : and i will multiply them , and they shall not be few ; i will also glorify them , and they shall not be small .
for i will restore health unto thee , and i will heal thee of thy wounds , saith the lord ; because they called thee an outcast , saying , this is zion , whom no man seeketh after .
thus saith the lord ; behold , i will bring again the captivity of jacob ' s tents , and have mercy on his dwellingplaces ; and the city shall be builded upon her own heap , and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof .
and their nobles shall be of themselves , and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them ; and i will cause him to draw near , and he shall approach unto me : for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me ? saith the lord .
their children also shall be as aforetime , and their congregation shall be established before me , and i will punish all that oppress them .
behold , the whirlwind of the lord goeth forth with fury , a continuing whirlwind : it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked .
and ye shall be my people , and i will be your god .
this is my comfort in my affliction : for thy word hath quickened me .
the proud have had me greatly in derision : yet have i not declined from thy law .
i remembered thy judgments of old , o lord ; and have comforted myself .
horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law .
then jehu came forth to the servants of his lord : and one said unto him , is all well ? wherefore came this mad fellow to thee ? and he said unto them , ye know the man , and his communication .
i have remembered thy name , o lord , in the night , and have kept thy law .
and the dogs shall eat jezebel in the portion of jezreel , and there shall be none to bury her . and he opened the door , and fled .
thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage .
thou art my portion , o lord : i have said that i would keep thy words .
this i had , because i kept thy precepts .
i thought on my ways , and turned my feet unto thy testimonies .
i intreated thy favour with my whole heart : be merciful unto me according to thy word .
the fierce anger of the lord shall not return , until he have done it , and until he have performed the intents of his heart : in the latter days ye shall consider it .
and i will bring you out of the midst thereof , and deliver you into the hands of strangers , and will execute judgments among you .
ye have feared the sword ; and i will bring a sword upon you , saith the lord god .
therefore thus saith the lord god ; your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it , they are the flesh , and this city is the caldron : but i will bring you forth out of the midst of it .
ye have multiplied your slain in this city , and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain .
and the spirit of the lord fell upon me , and said unto me , speak ; thus saith the lord ; thus have ye said , o house of israel : for i know the things that come into your mind , every one of them .
therefore prophesy against them , prophesy , o son of man .
and when he was come in , he did eat and drink , and said , go , see now this cursed woman , and bury her : for she is a king ' s daughter .
and they went to bury her : but they found no more of her than the skull , and the feet , and the palms of her hands .
my soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judgments at all times .
wherefore they came again , and told him . and he said , this is the word of the lord , which he spake by his servant elijah the tishbite , saying , in the portion of jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of jezebel :
and the carcase of jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of jezreel ; so that they shall not say , this is jezebel .
my soul melteth for heaviness : strengthen thou me according unto thy word .
make me to understand the way of thy precepts : so shall i talk of thy wondrous works .
i have declared my ways , and thou heardest me : teach me thy statutes .
my soul cleaveth unto the dust : quicken thou me according to thy word .
thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors .
remove from me reproach and contempt ; for i have kept thy testimonies .
thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed , which do err from thy commandments .
then said he unto me , son of man , these are the men that devise mischief , and give wicked counsel in this city :
which say , it is not near ; let us build houses : this city is the caldron , and we be the flesh .
remove from me the way of lying : and grant me thy law graciously .
then said jehu to bidkar his captain , take up , and cast him in the portion of the field of naboth the jezreelite : for remember how that , when i and thou rode together after ahab his father , the lord laid this burden upon him ;
surely i have seen yesterday the blood of naboth , and the blood of his sons , saith the lord ; and i will requite thee in this plat , saith the lord . now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground , according to the word of the lord .
and joram turned his hands , and fled , and said to ahaziah , there is treachery , o ahaziah .
i have chosen the way of truth : thy judgments have i laid before me .
and jehu drew a bow with his full strength , and smote jehoram between his arms , and the arrow went out at his heart , and he sunk down in his chariot .
i have stuck unto thy testimonies : o lord , put me not to shame .
and in the eleventh year of joram the son of ahab began ahaziah to reign over judah .
and his servants carried him in a chariot to jerusalem , and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of david .
turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity ; and quicken thou me in thy way .
incline my heart unto thy testimonies , and not to covetousness .
turn away my reproach which i fear : for thy judgments are good .
stablish thy word unto thy servant , who is devoted to thy fear .
and he said , throw her down . so they threw her down : and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall , and on the horses : and he trode her under foot .
teach me , o lord , the way of thy statutes ; and i shall keep it unto the end .
i will run the way of thy commandments , when thou shalt enlarge my heart .
and as jehu entered in at the gate , she said , had zimri peace , who slew his master ?
make me to go in the path of thy commandments ; for therein do i delight .
and when jehu was come to jezreel , jezebel heard of it ; and she painted her face , and tired her head , and looked out at a window .
give me understanding , and i shall keep thy law ; yea , i shall observe it with my whole heart .
they had almost consumed me upon earth ; but i forsook not thy precepts .
quicken me after thy lovingkindness ; so shall i keep the testimony of thy mouth .
for ever , o lord , thy word is settled in heaven .
and it was so , that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance , he put forth his hand , and took him , and kissed him .
let my heart be sound in thy statutes ; that i be not ashamed .
whose end is destruction , whose god is their belly , and whose glory is in their shame , who mind earthly things . )
absalom said moreover , oh that i were made judge in the land , that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me , and i would do him justice !
mine eyes fail for thy word , saying , when wilt thou comfort me ?
and on this manner did absalom to all israel that came to the king for judgment : so absalom stole the hearts of the men of israel .
my soul fainteth for thy salvation : but i hope in thy word .
nevertheless , whereto we have already attained , let us walk by the same rule , let us mind the same thing .
and it came to pass after this , that absalom prepared him chariots and horses , and fifty men to run before him .
how many are the days of thy servant ? when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me ?
let us therefore , as many as be perfect , be thus minded : and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded , god shall reveal even this unto you .
for i am become like a bottle in the smoke ; yet do i not forget thy statutes .
( for many walk , of whom i have told you often , and now tell you even weeping , that they are the enemies of the cross of christ :
nathanael answered and saith unto him , rabbi , thou art the son of god ; thou art the king of israel .
and absalom said unto him , see , thy matters are good and right ; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee .
all thy commandments are faithful : they persecute me wrongfully ; help thou me .
brethren , be followers together of me , and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample .
nathanael saith unto him , whence knowest thou me ? jesus answered and said unto him , before that philip called thee , when thou wast under the fig tree , i saw thee .
the proud have digged pits for me , which are not after thy law .
not as though i had already attained , either were already perfect : but i follow after , if that i may apprehend that for which also i am apprehended of christ jesus .
jesus saw nathanael coming to him , and saith of him , behold an israelite indeed , in whom is no guile !
if by any means i might attain unto the resurrection of the dead .
and nathanael said unto him , can there any good thing come out of nazareth ? philip saith unto him , come and see .
i press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus .
philip findeth nathanael , and saith unto him , we have found him , of whom moses in the law , and the prophets , did write , jesus of nazareth , the son of joseph .
brethren , i count not myself to have apprehended : but this one thing i do , forgetting those things which are behind , and reaching forth unto those things which are before ,
now philip was of bethsaida , the city of andrew and peter .
the day following jesus would go forth into galilee , and findeth philip , and saith unto him , follow me .
and the king said unto him , go in peace . so he arose , and went to hebron .
and he brought him to jesus . and when jesus beheld him , he said , thou art simon the son of jona : thou shalt be called cephas , which is by interpretation , a stone .
for thy servant vowed a vow while i abode at geshur in syria , saying , if the lord shall bring me again indeed to jerusalem , then i will serve the lord .
that i may know him , and the power of his resurrection , and the fellowship of his sufferings , being made conformable unto his death ;
he first findeth his own brother simon , and saith unto him , we have found the messias , which is , being interpreted , the christ .
one of the two which heard john speak , and followed him , was andrew , simon peter ' s brother .
jesus answered and said unto him , because i said unto thee , i saw thee under the fig tree , believest thou ? thou shalt see greater things than these .
thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies : for they are ever with me .
i have more understanding than all my teachers : for thy testimonies are my meditation .
and to knowledge temperance ; and to temperance patience ; and to patience godliness ;
i will never forget thy precepts : for with them thou hast quickened me .
and to godliness brotherly kindness ; and to brotherly kindness charity .
whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises : that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature , having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust .
they continue this day according to thine ordinances : for all are thy servants .
thy faithfulness is unto all generations : thou hast established the earth , and it abideth .
grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god , and of jesus our lord ,
o how love i thy law ! it is my meditation all the day .
according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness , through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue :
i have seen an end of all perfection : but thy commandment is exceeding broad .
the wicked have waited for me to destroy me : but i will consider thy testimonies .
simon peter , a servant and an apostle of jesus christ , to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our saviour jesus christ :
i am thine , save me ; for i have sought thy precepts .
who shall change our vile body , that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body , according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself .
for our conversation is in heaven ; from whence also we look for the saviour , the lord jesus christ :
and he saith unto him , verily , verily , i say unto you , hereafter ye shall see heaven open , and the angels of god ascending and descending upon the son of man .
for if these things be in you , and abound , they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ .
the proud have forged a lie against me : but i will keep thy precepts with my whole heart .
thou hast dealt well with thy servant , o lord , according unto thy word .
teach me good judgment and knowledge : for i have believed thy commandments .
before i was afflicted i went astray : but now have i kept thy word .
thou art good , and doest good ; teach me thy statutes .
the next day john seeth jesus coming unto him , and saith , behold the lamb of god , which taketh away the sin of the world .
at midnight i will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments .
these things were done in bethabara beyond jordan , where john was baptizing .
he it is , who coming after me is preferred before me , whose shoe ' s latchet i am not worthy to unloose .
the earth , o lord , is full of thy mercy : teach me thy statutes .
john answered them , saying , i baptize with water : but there standeth one among you , whom ye know not ;
i am a companion of all them that fear thee , and of them that keep thy precepts .
i made haste , and delayed not to keep thy commandments .
and they asked him , what then ? art thou elias ? and he saith , i am not . art thou that prophet ? and he answered , no .
and he confessed , and denied not ; but confessed , i am not the christ .
and they asked him , and said unto him , why baptizest thou then , if thou be not that christ , nor elias , neither that prophet ?
and they which were sent were of the pharisees .
he said , i am the voice of one crying in the wilderness , make straight the way of the lord , as said the prophet esaias .
then said they unto him , who art thou ? that we may give an answer to them that sent us . what sayest thou of thyself ?
i have declared the former things from the beginning ; and they went forth out of my mouth , and i shewed them ; i did them suddenly , and they came to pass .
because i knew that thou art obstinate , and thy neck is an iron sinew , and thy brow brass ;
i have even from the beginning declared it to thee ; before it came to pass i shewed it thee : lest thou shouldest say , mine idol hath done them , and my graven image , and my molten image , hath commanded them .
thou hast heard , see all this ; and will not ye declare it ? i have shewed thee new things from this time , even hidden things , and thou didst not know them .
let the proud be ashamed ; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause : but i will meditate in thy precepts .
let those that fear thee turn unto me , and those that have known thy testimonies .
let , i pray thee , thy merciful kindness be for my comfort , according to thy word unto thy servant .
hear ye this , o house of jacob , which are called by the name of israel , and are come forth out of the waters of judah , which swear by the name of the lord , and make mention of the god of israel , but not in truth , nor in righteousness .
let thy tender mercies come unto me , that i may live : for thy law is my delight .
for they call themselves of the holy city , and stay themselves upon the god of israel ; the lord of hosts is his name .
then jesus turned , and saw them following , and saith unto them , what seek ye ? they said unto him , rabbi , ( which is to say , being interpreted , master , ) where dwellest thou ?
i know , o lord , that thy judgments are right , and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me .
and the two disciples heard him speak , and they followed jesus .
they that fear thee will be glad when they see me ; because i have hoped in thy word .
thy hands have made me and fashioned me : give me understanding , that i may learn thy commandments .
he saith unto them , come and see . they came and saw where he dwelt , and abode with him that day : for it was about the tenth hour .
the law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver .
it is good for me that i have been afflicted ; that i might learn thy statutes .
yea , thou heardest not ; yea , thou knewest not ; yea , from that time that thine ear was not opened : for i knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously , and wast called a transgressor from the womb .
their heart is as fat as grease ; but i delight in thy law .
they are created now , and not from the beginning ; even before the day when thou heardest them not ; lest thou shouldest say , behold , i knew them .
for my name ' s sake will i defer mine anger , and for my praise will i refrain for thee , that i cut thee not off .
this is he of whom i said , after me cometh a man which is preferred before me : for he was before me .
and john bare record , saying , i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove , and it abode upon him .
and i knew him not : but that he should be made manifest to israel , therefore am i come baptizing with water .
and i saw , and bare record that this is the son of god .
and i knew him not : but he that sent me to baptize with water , the same said unto me , upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending , and remaining on him , the same is he which baptizeth with the holy ghost .
again the next day after john stood , and two of his disciples ;
the silver is mine , and the gold is mine , saith the lord of hosts .
but when ye shall hear of wars and commotions , be not terrified : for these things must first come to pass ; but the end is not by and by .
the glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former , saith the lord of hosts : and in this place will i give peace , saith the lord of hosts .
and he said , take heed that ye be not deceived : for many shall come in my name , saying , i am christ ; and the time draweth near : go ye not therefore after them .
and they asked him , saying , master , but when shall these things be ? and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass ?
and he told it to his father , and to his brethren : and his father rebuked him , and said unto him , what is this dream that thou hast dreamed ? shall i and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth ?
according to the word that i covenanted with you when ye came out of egypt , so my spirit remaineth among you : fear ye not .
yet now be strong , o zerubbabel , saith the lord ; and be strong , o joshua , son of josedech , the high priest ; and be strong , all ye people of the land , saith the lord , and work : for i am with you , saith the lord of hosts :
and i will shake all nations , and the desire of all nations shall come : and i will fill this house with glory , saith the lord of hosts .
for thus saith the lord of hosts ; yet once , it is a little while , and i will shake the heavens , and the earth , and the sea , and the dry land ;
in the seventh month , in the one and twentieth day of the month , came the word of the lord by the prophet haggai , saying ,
who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory ? and how do ye see it now ? is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing ?
speak now to zerubbabel the son of shealtiel , governor of judah , and to joshua the son of josedech , the high priest , and to the residue of the people , saying ,
and they said one to another , behold , this dreamer cometh .
for it shall come to pass in that day , saith the lord of hosts , that i will break his yoke from off thy neck , and will burst thy bonds , and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him :
but they shall serve the lord their god , and david their king , whom i will raise up unto them .
ask ye now , and see whether a man doth travail with child ? wherefore do i see every man with his hands on his loins , as a woman in travail , and all faces are turned into paleness ?
alas ! for that day is great , so that none is like it : it is even the time of jacob ' s trouble ; but he shall be saved out of it .
and his brethren went to feed their father ' s flock in shechem .
and these are the words that the lord spake concerning israel and concerning judah .
and his brethren envied him ; but his father observed the saying .
for thus saith the lord ; we have heard a voice of trembling , of fear , and not of peace .
thus speaketh the lord god of israel , saying , write thee all the words that i have spoken unto thee in a book .
and israel said unto joseph , do not thy brethren feed the flock in shechem ? come , and i will send thee unto them . and he said to him , here am i .
for , lo , the days come , saith the lord , that i will bring again the captivity of my people israel and judah , saith the lord : and i will cause them to return to the land that i gave to their fathers , and they shall possess it .
and he said , i seek my brethren : tell me , i pray thee , where they feed their flocks .
and a certain man found him , and , behold , he was wandering in the field : and the man asked him , saying , what seekest thou ?
the word that came to jeremiah from the lord , saying ,
and when they saw him afar off , even before he came near unto them , they conspired against him to slay him .
and the man said , they are departed hence ; for i heard them say , let us go to dothan . and joseph went after his brethren , and found them in dothan .
he came unto his own , and his own received him not .
which were born , not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of god .
and the word was made flesh , and dwelt among us , ( and we beheld his glory , the glory as of the only begotten of the father , ) full of grace and truth .
come now therefore , and let us slay him , and cast him into some pit , and we will say , some evil beast hath devoured him : and we shall see what will become of his dreams .
he was in the world , and the world was made by him , and the world knew him not .
and reuben heard it , and he delivered him out of their hands ; and said , let us not kill him .
and this is the record of john , when the jews sent priests and levites from jerusalem to ask him , who art thou ?
and he said , of a truth i say unto you , that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all :
for all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of god : but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had .
and as some spake of the temple , how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts , he said ,
as for these things which ye behold , the days will come , in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down .
john bare witness of him , and cried , saying , this was he of whom i spake , he that cometh after me is preferred before me : for he was before me .
and of his fulness have all we received , and grace for grace .
for the law was given by moses , but grace and truth came by jesus christ .
and he looked up , and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury .
no man hath seen god at any time ; the only begotten son , which is in the bosom of the father , he hath declared him .
and he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites .
then there passed by midianites merchantmen ; and they drew and lifted up joseph out of the pit , and sold joseph to the ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver : and they brought joseph into egypt .
come , and let us sell him to the ishmeelites , and let not our hand be upon him ; for he is our brother and our flesh . and his brethren were content .
and judah said unto his brethren , what profit is it if we slay our brother , and conceal his blood ?
and they sat down to eat bread : and they lifted up their eyes and looked , and , behold , a company of ishmeelites came from gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh , going to carry it down to egypt .
and they took him , and cast him into a pit : and the pit was empty , there was no water in it .
and it came to pass , when joseph was come unto his brethren , that they stript joseph out of his coat , his coat of many colours that was on him ;
and reuben said unto them , shed no blood , but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness , and lay no hand upon him ; that he might rid him out of their hands , to deliver him to his father again .
and they took joseph ' s coat , and killed a kid of the goats , and dipped the coat in the blood ;
an evil disease , say they , cleaveth fast unto him : and now that he lieth he shall rise up no more .
and they sent the coat of many colours , and they brought it to their father ; and said , this have we found : know now whether it be thy son ' s coat or no .
all that hate me whisper together against me : against me do they devise my hurt .
and if he come to see me , he speaketh vanity : his heart gathereth iniquity to itself ; when he goeth abroad , he telleth it .
and he returned unto his brethren , and said , the child is not ; and i , whither shall i go ?
mine enemies speak evil of me , when shall he die , and his name perish ?
are there not mockers with me ? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation ?
my breath is corrupt , my days are extinct , the graves are ready for me .
for thou hast hid their heart from understanding : therefore shalt thou not exalt them .
lay down now , put me in a surety with thee ; who is he that will strike hands with me ?
he hath made me also a byword of the people ; and aforetime i was as a tabret .
he that speaketh flattery to his friends , even the eyes of his children shall fail .
and jacob rent his clothes , and put sackcloth upon his loins , and mourned for his son many days .
upright men shall be astonied at this , and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite .
blessed is he that considereth the poor : the lord will deliver him in time of trouble .
and he knew it , and said , it is my son ' s coat ; an evil beast hath devoured him ; joseph is without doubt rent in pieces .
mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow , and all my members are as a shadow .
the lord will preserve him , and keep him alive ; and he shall be blessed upon the earth : and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies .
and the midianites sold him into egypt unto potiphar , an officer of pharaoh ' s , and captain of the guard .
the lord will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing : thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness .
and all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him ; but he refused to be comforted ; and he said , for i will go down into the grave unto my son mourning . thus his father wept for him .
the righteous also shall hold on his way , and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger .
i said , lord , be merciful unto me : heal my soul ; for i have sinned against thee .
but i trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates .
now i pray to god that ye do no evil ; not that we should appear approved , but that ye should do that which is honest , though we be as reprobates .
for though he was crucified through weakness , yet he liveth by the power of god . for we also are weak in him , but we shall live with him by the power of god toward you .
examine yourselves , whether ye be in the faith ; prove your own selves . know ye not your own selves , how that jesus christ is in you , except ye be reprobates ?
i told you before , and foretell you , as if i were present , the second time ; and being absent now i write to them which heretofore have sinned , and to all other , that , if i come again , i will not spare :
since ye seek a proof of christ speaking in me , which to you - ward is not weak , but is mighty in you .
all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers : but the sheep did not hear them .
this is the third time i am coming to you . in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established .
i am the door : by me if any man enter in , he shall be saved , and shall go in and out , and find pasture .
truly my soul waiteth upon god : from him cometh my salvation .
how long will ye imagine mischief against a man ? ye shall be slain all of you : as a bowing wall shall ye be , and as a tottering fence .
he only is my rock and my salvation ; he is my defence ; i shall not be greatly moved .
for we can do nothing against the truth , but for the truth .
my soul , wait thou only upon god ; for my expectation is from him .
for we are glad , when we are weak , and ye are strong : and this also we wish , even your perfection .
they only consult to cast him down from his excellency : they delight in lies : they bless with their mouth , but they curse inwardly . selah .
trust in him at all times ; ye people , pour out your heart before him : god is a refuge for us . selah .
and he said , blessed be thou of the lord , my daughter : for thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning , inasmuch as thou followedst not young men , whether poor or rich .
surely men of low degree are vanity , and men of high degree are a lie : to be laid in the balance , they are altogether lighter than vanity .
he only is my rock and my salvation : he is my defence ; i shall not be moved .
in god is my salvation and my glory : the rock of my strength , and my refuge , is in god .
and she lay at his feet until the morning : and she rose up before one could know another . and he said , let it not be known that a woman came into the floor .
and now , my daughter , fear not ; i will do to thee all that thou requirest : for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman .
and now it is true that i am thy near kinsman : howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than i .
and a stranger will they not follow , but will flee from him : for they know not the voice of strangers .
and when he putteth forth his own sheep , he goeth before them , and the sheep follow him : for they know his voice .
then said she , sit still , my daughter , until thou know how the matter will fall : for the man will not be in rest , until he have finished the thing this day .
then said jesus unto them again , verily , verily , i say unto you , i am the door of the sheep .
also he said , bring the vail that thou hast upon thee , and hold it . and when she held it , he measured six measures of barley , and laid it on her : and she went into the city .
this parable spake jesus unto them : but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them .
and when she came to her mother in law , she said , who art thou , my daughter ? and she told her all that the man had done to her .
verily , verily , i say unto you , he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold , but climbeth up some other way , the same is a thief and a robber .
to him the porter openeth ; and the sheep hear his voice : and he calleth his own sheep by name , and leadeth them out .
but he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep .
surely none of the men that came up out of egypt , from twenty years old and upward , shall see the land which i sware unto abraham , unto isaac , and unto jacob ; because they have not wholly followed me :
and the lord ' s anger was kindled the same time , and he sware , saying ,
and the lord ' s anger was kindled against israel , and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years , until all the generation , that had done evil in the sight of the lord , was consumed .
for if ye turn away from after him , he will yet again leave them in the wilderness ; and ye shall destroy all this people .
and , behold , ye are risen up in your fathers ' stead , an increase of sinful men , to augment yet the fierce anger of the lord toward israel .
and they went up out of egypt , and came into the land of canaan unto jacob their father ,
and told him , saying , joseph is yet alive , and he is governor over all the land of egypt . and jacob ' s heart fainted , for he believed them not .
and to his father he sent after this manner ; ten asses laden with the good things of egypt , and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way .
so he sent his brethren away , and they departed : and he said unto them , see that ye fall not out by the way .
and the children of israel did so : and joseph gave them wagons , according to the commandment of pharaoh , and gave them provision for the way .
to all of them he gave each man changes of raiment ; but to benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver , and five changes of raiment .
also regard not your stuff ; for the good of all the land of egypt is yours .
now the things which i write unto you , behold , before god , i lie not .
afterwards i came into the regions of syria and cilicia ;
and was unknown by face unto the churches of judaea which were in christ :
but they had heard only , that he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed .
and they told him all the words of joseph , which he had said unto them : and when he saw the wagons which joseph had sent to carry him , the spirit of jacob their father revived :
and they glorified god in me .
and israel said , it is enough ; joseph my son is yet alive : i will go and see him before i die .
to reveal his son in me , that i might preach him among the heathen ; immediately i conferred not with flesh and blood :
neither went i up to jerusalem to them which were apostles before me ; but i went into arabia , and returned again unto damascus .
and profited in the jews ' religion above many my equals in mine own nation , being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers .
but when it pleased god , who separated me from my mother ' s womb , and called me by his grace ,
then after three years i went up to jerusalem to see peter , and abode with him fifteen days .
but other of the apostles saw i none , save james the lord ' s brother .
for i neither received it of man , neither was i taught it , but by the revelation of jesus christ .
for do i now persuade men , or god ? or do i seek to please men ? for if i yet pleased men , i should not be the servant of christ .
and as for me , thou upholdest me in mine integrity , and settest me before thy face for ever .
blessed be the lord god of israel from everlasting , and to everlasting . amen , and amen .
but thou , o lord , be merciful unto me , and raise me up , that i may requite them .
by this i know that thou favourest me , because mine enemy doth not triumph over me .
if we suffer , we shall also reign with him : if we deny him , he also will deny us :
study to shew thyself approved unto god , a workman that needeth not to be ashamed , rightly dividing the word of truth .
but shun profane and vain babblings : for they will increase unto more ungodliness .
and their word will eat as doth a canker : of whom is hymenaeus and philetus ;
who concerning the truth have erred , saying that the resurrection is past already ; and overthrow the faith of some .
nevertheless the foundation of god standeth sure , having this seal , the lord knoweth them that are his . and , let every one that nameth the name of christ depart from iniquity .
it is a faithful saying : for if we be dead with him , we shall also live with him :
therefore i endure all things for the elect ' s sakes , that they may also obtain the salvation which is in christ jesus with eternal glory .
in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves ; if god peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth ;
and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil , who are taken captive by him at his will .
but foolish and unlearned questions avoid , knowing that they do gender strifes .
and the servant of the lord must not strive ; but be gentle unto all men , apt to teach , patient ,
flee also youthful lusts : but follow righteousness , faith , charity , peace , with them that call on the lord out of a pure heart .
if a man therefore purge himself from these , he shall be a vessel unto honour , sanctified , and meet for the master ' s use , and prepared unto every good work .
but in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver , but also of wood and of earth ; and some to honour , and some to dishonour .
and jair the son of manasseh went and took the small towns thereof , and called them havoth - jair .
and nobah went and took kenath , and the villages thereof , and called it nobah , after his own name .
and moses gave gilead unto machir the son of manasseh ; and he dwelt therein .
and the children of machir the son of manasseh went to gilead , and took it , and dispossessed the amorite which was in it .
and nebo , and baal - meon , ( their names being changed , ) and shibmah : and gave other names unto the cities which they builded .
and if it be not so now , who will make me a liar , and make my speech nothing worth ?
though it be given him to be in safety , whereon he resteth ; yet his eyes are upon their ways .
they are exalted for a little while , but are gone and brought low ; they are taken out of the way as all other , and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn .
he draweth also the mighty with his power : he riseth up , and no man is sure of life .
the womb shall forget him ; the worm shall feed sweetly on him ; he shall be no more remembered ; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree .
but if ye will not do so , behold , ye have sinned against the lord : and be sure your sin will find you out .
hear ; for i will speak of excellent things ; and the opening of my lips shall be right things .
build you cities for your little ones , and folds for your sheep ; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth .
o ye simple , understand wisdom : and , ye fools , be ye of an understanding heart .
and the children of gad and the children of reuben spake unto moses , saying , thy servants will do as my lord commandeth .
our little ones , our wives , our flocks , and all our cattle , shall be there in the cities of gilead :
she crieth at the gates , at the entry of the city , at the coming in at the doors .
and moses said unto them , if ye will do this thing , if ye will go armed before the lord to war ,
they are all plain to him that understandeth , and right to them that find knowledge .
and will go all of you armed over jordan before the lord , until he hath driven out his enemies from before him ,
all the words of my mouth are in righteousness ; there is nothing froward or perverse in them .
and the land be subdued before the lord : then afterward ye shall return , and be guiltless before the lord , and before israel ; and this land shall be your possession before the lord .
for my mouth shall speak truth ; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips .
in the dark they dig through houses , which they had marked for themselves in the daytime : they know not the light .
for the morning is to them even as the shadow of death : if one know them , they are in the terrors of the shadow of death .
he is swift as the waters ; their portion is cursed in the earth : he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards .
drought and heat consume the snow waters : so doth the grave those which have sinned .
men groan from out of the city , and the soul of the wounded crieth out : yet god layeth not folly to them .
they are of those that rebel against the light ; they know not the ways thereof , nor abide in the paths thereof .
the murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy , and in the night is as a thief .
the eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight , saying , no eye shall see me : and disguiseth his face .
which make oil within their walls , and tread their winepresses , and suffer thirst .
they cause him to go naked without clothing , and they take away the sheaf from the hungry ;
but we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of israel , until we have brought them unto their place : and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land .
doth not wisdom cry ? and understanding put forth her voice ?
and they came near unto him , and said , we will build sheepfolds here for our cattle , and cities for our little ones :
she standeth in the top of high places , by the way in the places of the paths .
for we will not inherit with them on yonder side jordan , or forward ; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side jordan eastward .
we will not return unto our houses , until the children of israel have inherited every man his inheritance .
and beth - nimrah , and beth - haran , fenced cities : and folds for sheep .
and the children of reuben built heshbon , and elealeh , and kirjathaim ,
and the children of gad built dibon , and ataroth , and aroer ,
and atroth , shophan , and jaazer , and jogbehah ,
we will pass over armed before the lord into the land of canaan , that the possession of our inheritance on this side jordan may be ours .
but if they will not pass over with you armed , they shall have possessions among you in the land of canaan .
and the children of gad and the children of reuben answered , saying , as the lord hath said unto thy servants , so will we do .
and moses said unto them , if the children of gad and the children of reuben will pass with you over jordan , every man armed to battle , before the lord , and the land shall be subdued before you ; then ye shall give them the land of gilead for a possession :
so concerning them moses commanded eleazar the priest , and joshua the son of nun , and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of israel :
but thy servants will pass over , every man armed for war , before the lord to battle , as my lord saith .
thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil ; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment :
thou shalt not raise a false report : put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness .
thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause .
if thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden , and wouldest forbear to help him , thou shalt surely help with him .
if thou meet thine enemy ' s ox or his ass going astray , thou shalt surely bring it back to him again .
neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause .
also thou shalt not oppress a stranger : for ye know the heart of a stranger , seeing ye were strangers in the land of egypt .
keep thee far from a false matter ; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not : for i will not justify the wicked .
and jesus said unto them , neither tell i you by what authority i do these things .
then began he to speak to the people this parable ; a certain man planted a vineyard , and let it forth to husbandmen , and went into a far country for a long time .
the children of bigvai , two thousand fifty and six .
the children of ater of hezekiah , ninety and eight .
the children of bezai , three hundred twenty and three .
the children of bani , six hundred forty and two .
the children of bebai , six hundred twenty and three .
the children of azgad , a thousand two hundred twenty and two .
the children of adonikam , six hundred sixty and six .
and he answered and said unto them , i will also ask you one thing ; and answer me :
and spake unto him , saying , tell us , by what authority doest thou these things ? or who is he that gave thee this authority ?
and it came to pass , that on one of those days , as he taught the people in the temple , and preached the gospel , the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders ,
and they answered , that they could not tell whence it was .
but and if we say , of men ; all the people will stone us : for they be persuaded that john was a prophet .
and they reasoned with themselves , saying , if we shall say , from heaven ; he will say , why then believed ye him not ?
the baptism of john , was it from heaven , or of men ?
and he went up from thence unto bethel : and as he was going up by the way , there came forth little children out of the city , and mocked him , and said unto him , go up , thou bald head ; go up , thou bald head .
so the waters were healed unto this day , according to the saying of elisha which he spake .
for the lord ' s portion is his people ; jacob is the lot of his inheritance .
and he went forth unto the spring of the waters , and cast the salt in there , and said , thus saith the lord , i have healed these waters ; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land .
and he said , bring me a new cruse , and put salt therein . and they brought it to him .
and he went from thence to mount carmel , and from thence he returned to samaria .
and he turned back , and looked on them , and cursed them in the name of the lord . and there came forth two she bears out of the wood , and tare forty and two children of them .
give ear , o ye heavens , and i will speak ; and hear , o earth , the words of my mouth .
my doctrine shall drop as the rain , my speech shall distil as the dew , as the small rain upon the tender herb , and as the showers upon the grass :
because i will publish the name of the lord : ascribe ye greatness unto our god .
he is the rock , his work is perfect : for all his ways are judgment : a god of truth and without iniquity , just and right is he .
they have corrupted themselves , their spot is not the spot of his children : they are a perverse and crooked generation .
do ye thus requite the lord , o foolish people and unwise ? is not he thy father that hath bought thee ? hath he not made thee , and established thee ?
remember the days of old , consider the years of many generations : ask thy father , and he will shew thee ; thy elders , and they will tell thee .
when the most high divided to the nations their inheritance , when he separated the sons of adam , he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of israel .
and he said , thou hast asked a hard thing : nevertheless , if thou see me when i am taken from thee , it shall be so unto thee ; but if not , it shall not be so .
and elisha saw it , and he cried , my father , my father , the chariot of israel , and the horsemen thereof . and he saw him no more : and he took hold of his own clothes , and rent them in two pieces .
and it came to pass , as they still went on , and talked , that , behold , there appeared a chariot of fire , and horses of fire , and parted them both asunder ; and elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven .
and when they came again to him , ( for he tarried at jericho , ) he said unto them , did i not say unto you , go not ?
and when they urged him till he was ashamed , he said , send . they sent therefore fifty men ; and they sought three days , but found him not .
and the men of the city said unto elisha , behold , i pray thee , the situation of this city is pleasant , as my lord seeth : but the water is naught , and the ground barren .
and he took the mantle of elijah that fell from him , and smote the waters , and said , where is the lord god of elijah ? and when he also had smitten the waters , they parted hither and thither : and elisha went over .
he took up also the mantle of elijah that fell from him , and went back , and stood by the bank of jordan ;
and when the sons of the prophets which were to view at jericho saw him , they said , the spirit of elijah doth rest on elisha . and they came to meet him , and bowed themselves to the ground before him .
and i saw the dead , small and great , stand before god ; and the books were opened : and another book was opened , which is the book of life : and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books , according to their works .
and the sea gave up the dead which were in it ; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them : and they were judged every man according to their works .
and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone , where the beast and the false prophet are , and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever .
and i saw a great white throne , and him that sat on it , from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away ; and there was found no place for them .
and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire . this is the second death .
and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire .
the children of the porters : the children of shallum , the children of ater , the children of talmon , the children of akkub , the children of hatita , the children of shobai , in all an hundred thirty and nine .
the singers : the children of asaph , an hundred twenty and eight .
the levites : the children of jeshua and kadmiel , of the children of hodaviah , seventy and four .
the children of uzza , the children of paseah , the children of besai ,
the children of rezin , the children of nekoda , the children of gazzam ,
the children of giddel , the children of gahar , the children of reaiah ,
what will ye ? shall i come unto you with a rod , or in love , and in the spirit of meekness ?
the children of hagab , the children of shalmai , the children of hanan ,
the children of lebanah , the children of hagabah , the children of akkub ,
the children of keros , the children of siaha , the children of padon ,
for the kingdom of god is not in word , but in power .
the nethinims : the children of ziha , the children of hasupha , the children of tabbaoth ,
and labour , working with our own hands : being reviled , we bless ; being persecuted , we suffer it :
the children of bakbuk , the children of hakupha , the children of harhur ,
being defamed , we intreat : we are made as the filth of the world , and are the offscouring of all things unto this day .
the children of asnah , the children of mehunim , the children of nephusim ,
i write not these things to shame you , but as my beloved sons i warn you .
the children of barkos , the children of sisera , the children of thamah ,
for though ye have ten thousand instructors in christ , yet have ye not many fathers : for in christ jesus i have begotten you through the gospel .
the children of bazluth , the children of mehida , the children of harsha ,
wherefore i beseech you , be ye followers of me .
for this cause have i sent unto you timotheus , who is my beloved son , and faithful in the lord , who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in christ , as i teach every where in every church .
now some are puffed up , as though i would not come to you .
and these were they which went up from tel - melah , tel - harsa , cherub , addan , and immer : but they could not shew their father ' s house , and their seed , whether they were of israel :
all the nethinims , and the children of solomon ' s servants , were three hundred ninety and two .
the children of solomon ' s servants : the children of sotai , the children of sophereth , the children of peruda ,
manasseh , ephraim ; and ephraim , manasseh : and they together shall be against judah . for all this his anger is not turned away , but his hand is stretched out still .
the children of neziah , the children of hatipha .
and he shall snatch on the right hand , and be hungry ; and he shall eat on the left hand , and they shall not be satisfied : they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm :
we are fools for christ ' s sake , but ye are wise in christ ; we are weak , but ye are strong ; ye are honourable , but we are despised .
the children of shephatiah , the children of hattil , the children of pochereth of zebaim , the children of ami .
even unto this present hour we both hunger , and thirst , and are naked , and are buffeted , and have no certain dwellingplace ;
the children of jaalah , the children of darkon , the children of giddel ,
through the wrath of the lord of hosts is the land darkened , and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire : no man shall spare his brother .
for the leaders of this people cause them to err ; and they that are led of them are destroyed .
the ancient and honourable , he is the head ; and the prophet that teacheth lies , he is the tail .
for wickedness burneth as the fire : it shall devour the briers and thorns , and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest , and they shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke .
therefore the lord shall have no joy in their young men , neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows : for every one is an hypocrite and an evildoer , and every mouth speaketh folly . for all this his anger is not turned away , but his hand is stretched out still .
the children of gibbar , ninety and five .
the syrians before , and the philistines behind ; and they shall devour israel with open mouth . for all this his anger is not turned away , but his hand is stretched out still .
therefore the lord shall set up the adversaries of rezin against him , and join his enemies together ;
therefore the lord will cut off from israel head and tail , branch and rush , in one day .
for the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them , neither do they seek the lord of hosts .
the children of azmaveth , forty and two .
the men of anathoth , an hundred twenty and eight .
the men of netophah , fifty and six .
the bricks are fallen down , but we will build with hewn stones : the sycomores are cut down , but we will change them into cedars .
the children of bethlehem , an hundred twenty and three .
the men of bethel and ai , two hundred twenty and three .
the men of michmas , an hundred twenty and two .
the children of ramah and geba , six hundred twenty and one .
the children of kirjath - arim , chephirah , and beeroth , seven hundred and forty and three .
and they took them out of the midst of the tent , and brought them unto joshua , and unto all the children of israel , and laid them out before the lord .
the children of jorah , an hundred and twelve .
and joshua said , why hast thou troubled us ? the lord shall trouble thee this day . and all israel stoned him with stones , and burned them with fire , after they had stoned them with stones .
the children of hashum , two hundred twenty and three .
and they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day . so the lord turned from the fierceness of his anger . wherefore the name of that place was called , the valley of achor , unto this day .
and achan answered joshua , and said , indeed i have sinned against the lord god of israel , and thus and thus have i done :
when i saw among the spoils a goodly babylonish garment , and two hundred shekels of silver , and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight , then i coveted them , and took them ; and , behold , they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent , and the silver under it .
so joshua sent messengers , and they ran unto the tent ; and , behold , it was hid in his tent , and the silver under it .
the children of the other elam , a thousand two hundred fifty and four .
the children of magbish , an hundred fifty and six .
the children of lod , hadid , and ono , seven hundred twenty and five .
the children of harim , three hundred and twenty .
the children of jericho , three hundred forty and five .
the children of immer , a thousand fifty and two .
the priests : the children of jedaiah , of the house of jeshua , nine hundred seventy and three .
for thy mercy is great unto the heavens , and thy truth unto the clouds .
the children of harim , a thousand and seventeen .
the children of pashur , a thousand two hundred forty and seven .
the children of nebo , fifty and two .
in the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes : and it shall be , that the tribe which the lord taketh shall come according to the families thereof ; and the family which the lord shall take shall come by households ; and the household which the lord shall take shall come man by man .
and it shall be , that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire , he and all that he hath : because he hath transgressed the covenant of the lord , and because he hath wrought folly in israel .
therefore the children of israel could not stand before their enemies , but turned their backs before their enemies , because they were accursed : neither will i be with you any more , except ye destroy the accursed from among you .
up , sanctify the people , and say , sanctify yourselves against to morrow : for thus saith the lord god of israel , there is an accursed thing in the midst of thee , o israel : thou canst not stand before thine enemies , until ye take away the accursed thing from among you .
be thou exalted , o god , above the heavens : let thy glory be above all the earth .
and the lord said unto joshua , get thee up ; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face ?
israel hath sinned , and they have also transgressed my covenant which i commanded them : for they have even taken of the accursed thing , and have also stolen , and dissembled also , and they have put it even among their own stuff .
and he brought his household man by man ; and achan , the son of carmi , the son of zabdi , the son of zerah , of the tribe of judah , was taken .
and joshua said unto achan , my son , give , i pray thee , glory to the lord god of israel , and make confession unto him ; and tell me now what thou hast done ; hide it not from me .
so joshua rose up early in the morning , and brought israel by their tribes ; and the tribe of judah was taken :
and he brought the family of judah ; and he took the family of the zarhites : and he brought the family of the zarhites man by man ; and zabdi was taken :
and the woman of tekoah said unto the king , my lord , o king , the iniquity be on me , and on my father ' s house : and the king and his throne be guiltless .
and take your father and your households , and come unto me : and i will give you the good of the land of egypt , and ye shall eat the fat of the land .
and pharaoh said unto joseph , say unto thy brethren , this do ye ; lade your beasts , and go , get you unto the land of canaan ;
and the fame thereof was heard in pharaoh ' s house , saying , joseph ' s brethren are come : and it pleased pharaoh well , and his servants .
and joab sent to tekoah , and fetched thence a wise woman , and said unto her , i pray thee , feign thyself to be a mourner , and put on now mourning apparel , and anoint not thyself with oil , but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead :
moreover he kissed all his brethren , and wept upon them : and after that his brethren talked with him .
now joab the son of zeruiah perceived that the king ' s heart was toward absalom .
and he fell upon his brother benjamin ' s neck , and wept ; and benjamin wept upon his neck .
and when the woman of tekoah spake to the king , she fell on her face to the ground , and did obeisance , and said , help , o king .
and ye shall tell my father of all my glory in egypt , and of all that ye have seen ; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither .
and come to the king , and speak on this manner unto him . so joab put the words in her mouth .
and , behold , your eyes see , and the eyes of my brother benjamin , that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you .
and thy handmaid had two sons , and they two strove together in the field , and there was none to part them , but the one smote the other , and slew him .
and there will i nourish thee ; for yet there are five years of famine ; lest thou , and thy household , and all that thou hast , come to poverty .
and thou shalt dwell in the land of goshen , and thou shalt be near unto me , thou , and thy children , and thy children ' s children , and thy flocks , and thy herds , and all that thou hast :
and the king said unto the woman , go to thine house , and i will give charge concerning thee .
then the glory of the lord went up from the cherub , and stood over the threshold of the house ; and the house was filled with the cloud , and the court was full of the brightness of the lord ' s glory .
now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house , when the man went in ; and the cloud filled the inner court .
beside their servants and their maids , of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven : and there were among them two hundred singing men and singing women .
and , behold , the acts of asa , first and last , lo , they are written in the book of the kings of judah and israel .
and the sound of the cherubims ' wings was heard even to the outer court , as the voice of the almighty god when he speaketh .
and asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet , until his disease was exceeding great : yet in his disease he sought not to the lord , but to the physicians .
and it came to pass , that when he had commanded the man clothed with linen , saying , take fire from between the wheels , from between the cherubims ; then he went in , and stood beside the wheels .
their camels , four hundred thirty and five ; their asses , six thousand seven hundred and twenty .
and one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that was between the cherubims , and took thereof , and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen : who took it , and went out .
and some of the chief of the fathers , when they came to the house of the lord which is at jerusalem , offered freely for the house of god to set it up in his place :
then asa was wroth with the seer , and put him in a prison house ; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing . and asa oppressed some of the people the same time .
and there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man ' s hand under their wings .
they gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work threescore and one thousand drams of gold , and five thousand pound of silver , and one hundred priests ' garments .
i delight to do thy will , o my god : yea , thy law is within my heart .
and when i looked , behold the four wheels by the cherubims , one wheel by one cherub , and another wheel by another cherub : and the appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone .
i have preached righteousness in the great congregation : lo , i have not refrained my lips , o lord , thou knowest .
sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire ; mine ears hast thou opened : burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required .
then said i , lo , i come : in the volume of the book it is written of me ,
the children of delaiah , the children of tobiah , the children of nekoda , six hundred fifty and two .
and of the children of the priests : the children of habaiah , the children of koz , the children of barzillai ; which took a wife of the daughters of barzillai the gileadite , and was called after their name :
these sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy , but they were not found : therefore were they , as polluted , put from the priesthood .
and the tirshatha said unto them , that they should not eat of the most holy things , till there stood up a priest with urim and with thummim .
and asa slept with his fathers , and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign .
the whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore ,
and they buried him in his own sepulchres , which he had made for himself in the city of david , and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries ' art : and they made a very great burning for him .
come down , and sit in the dust , o virgin daughter of babylon , sit on the ground : there is no throne , o daughter of the chaldeans : for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate .
take the millstones , and grind meal : uncover thy locks , make bare the leg , uncover the thigh , pass over the rivers .
thy nakedness shall be uncovered , yea , thy shame shall be seen : i will take vengeance , and i will not meet thee as a man .
as for our redeemer , the lord of hosts is his name , the holy one of israel .
sit thou silent , and get thee into darkness , o daughter of the chaldeans : for thou shalt no more be called , the lady of kingdoms .
i was wroth with my people , i have polluted mine inheritance , and given them into thine hand : thou didst shew them no mercy ; upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke .
and thou saidst , i shall be a lady for ever : so that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart , neither didst remember the latter end of it .
and he hath put a new song in my mouth , even praise unto our god : many shall see it , and fear , and shall trust in the lord .
he brought me up also out of an horrible pit , out of the miry clay , and set my feet upon a rock , and established my goings .
blessed is that man that maketh the lord his trust , and respecteth not the proud , nor such as turn aside to lies .
i waited patiently for the lord ; and he inclined unto me , and heard my cry .
so the priests , and the levites , and some of the people , and the singers , and the porters , and the nethinims , dwelt in their cities , and all israel in their cities .
but these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day , the loss of children , and widowhood : they shall come upon thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries , and for the great abundance of thine enchantments .
therefore hear now this , thou that art given to pleasures , that dwellest carelessly , that sayest in thine heart , i am , and none else beside me ; i shall not sit as a widow , neither shall i know the loss of children :
let the wicked fall into their own nets , whilst that i withal escape .
and thou hast filled me with wrinkles , which is a witness against me : and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face .
but i would strengthen you with my mouth , and the moving of my lips should asswage your grief .
i also could speak as ye do : if your soul were in my soul ' s stead , i could heap up words against you , and shake mine head at you .
but now he hath made me weary : thou hast made desolate all my company .
though i speak , my grief is not asswaged : and though i forbear , what am i eased ?
then job answered and said ,
shall vain words have an end ? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest ?
i have heard many such things : miserable comforters are ye all .
and joshua said unto all the people , thus saith the lord god of israel , your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time , even terah , the father of abraham , and the father of nachor : and they served other gods .
and i took your father abraham from the other side of the flood , and led him throughout all the land of canaan , and multiplied his seed , and gave him isaac .
and joshua gathered all the tribes of israel to shechem , and called for the elders of israel , and for their heads , and for their judges , and for their officers ; and they presented themselves before god .
and i brought your fathers out of egypt : and ye came unto the sea ; and the egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the red sea .
and when they cried unto the lord , he put darkness between you and the egyptians , and brought the sea upon them , and covered them ; and your eyes have seen what i have done in egypt : and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season .
and i gave unto isaac jacob and esau : and i gave unto esau mount seir , to possess it ; but jacob and his children went down into egypt .
and i brought you into the land of the amorites , which dwelt on the other side jordan ; and they fought with you : and i gave them into your hand , that ye might possess their land ; and i destroyed them from before you .

concerning the ordinance of oil , the bath of oil , ye shall offer the tenth part of a bath out of the cor , which is an homer of ten baths ; for ten baths are an homer :
and the shekel shall be twenty gerahs : twenty shekels , five and twenty shekels , fifteen shekels , shall be your manneh .
this is the oblation that ye shall offer ; the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of wheat , and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of barley :
ye shall have just balances , and a just ephah , and a just bath . i
the ephah and the bath shall be of one measure , that the bath may contain the tenth part of an homer , and the ephah the tenth part of an homer : the measure thereof shall be after the homer .
thus saith the lord god ; in the first month , in the first day of the month , thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish , and cleanse the sanctuary :
all the people of the land shall give this oblation for the prince in israel .
children , obey your parents in all things : for this is well pleasing unto the lord .
fathers , provoke not your children to anger , lest they be discouraged .
servants , obey in all things your masters according to the flesh ; not with eyeservice , as menpleasers ; but in singleness of heart , fearing god :
knowing that of the lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance : for ye serve the lord christ .
but he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done : and there is no respect of persons .
and it shall come to pass , if they will not believe thee , neither hearken to the voice of the first sign , that they will believe the voice of the latter sign .
and it shall come to pass , if they will not believe also these two signs , neither hearken unto thy voice , that thou shalt take of the water of the river , and pour it upon the dry land : and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land .

for judah prevailed above his brethren , and of him came the chief ruler ; but the birthright was joseph ' s : )
now the sons of reuben the firstborn of israel , ( for he was the firstborn ; but , forasmuch as he defiled his father ' s bed , his birthright was given unto the sons of joseph the son of israel : and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright .

and he is before all things , and by him all things consist .
and he is the head of the body , the church : who is the beginning , the firstborn from the dead ; that in all things he might have the preeminence .
for it pleased the father that in him should all fulness dwell ;
giving thanks unto the father , which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light :
who hath delivered us from the power of darkness , and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son :
in whom we have redemption through his blood , even the forgiveness of sins :
who is the image of the invisible god , the firstborn of every creature :
for , behold , the lord commandeth , and he will smite the great house with breaches , and the little house with clefts .
then said saul to his servant , well said ; come , let us go . so they went unto the city where the man of god was .
and they answered them , and said , he is ; behold , he is before you : make haste now , for he came to day to the city ; for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place :
and as they went up the hill to the city , they found young maidens going out to draw water , and said unto them , is the seer here ?
and they went up into the city : and when they were come into the city , behold , samuel came out against them , for to go up to the high place .
the blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil : so do stripes the inward parts of the belly .
now the lord had told samuel in his ear a day before saul came , saying ,
then saul drew near to samuel in the gate , and said , tell me , i pray thee , where the seer ' s house is .
and when samuel saw saul , the lord said unto him , behold the man whom i spake to thee of ! this same shall reign over my people .
and samuel answered saul , and said , i am the seer : go up before me unto the high place ; for ye shall eat with me to day , and to morrow i will let thee go , and will tell thee all that is in thine heart .
they shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains , and to the beasts of the earth : and the fowls shall summer upon them , and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them .
for afore the harvest , when the bud is perfect , and the sour grape is ripening in the flower , he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks , and take away and cut down the branches .
for so the lord said unto me , i will take my rest , and i will consider in my dwelling place like a clear heat upon herbs , and like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest .
and as for thine asses that were lost three days ago , set not thy mind on them ; for they are found . and on whom is all the desire of israel ? is it not on thee , and on all thy father ' s house ?
and saul answered and said , am not i a benjamite , of the smallest of the tribes of israel ? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of benjamin ? wherefore then speakest thou so to me ?
and when they were come down from the high place into the city , samuel communed with saul upon the top of the house .
whoso curseth his father or his mother , his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness .
and samuel said unto the cook , bring the portion which i gave thee , of which i said unto thee , set it by thee .
and samuel took saul and his servant , and brought them into the parlour , and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden , which were about thirty persons .
an inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning ; but the end thereof shall not be blessed .
man ' s goings are of the lord ; how can a man then understand his own way ?
divers weights are an abomination unto the lord ; and a false balance is not good .
and as they were going down to the end of the city , samuel said to saul , bid the servant pass on before us , ( and he passed on , ) but stand thou still a while , that i may shew thee the word of god .
a wise king scattereth the wicked , and bringeth the wheel over them .
and they arose early : and it came to pass about the spring of the day , that samuel called saul to the top of the house , saying , up , that i may send thee away . and saul arose , and they went out both of them , he and samuel , abroad .

love not sleep , lest thou come to poverty ; open thine eyes , and thou shalt be satisfied with bread .
and moses answered and said , but , behold , they will not believe me , nor hearken unto my voice : for they will say , the lord hath not appeared unto thee .
the hearing ear , and the seeing eye , the lord hath made even both of them .
and the lord said furthermore unto him , put now thine hand into thy bosom . and he put his hand into his bosom : and when he took it out , behold , his hand was leprous as snow .
even a child is known by his doings , whether his work be pure , and whether it be right .
and he said , put thine hand into thy bosom again . and he put his hand into his bosom again ; and plucked it out of his bosom , and , behold , it was turned again as his other flesh .
divers weights , and divers measures , both of them are alike abomination to the lord .
and the lord said unto moses , put forth thine hand , and take it by the tail . and he put forth his hand , and caught it , and it became a rod in his hand :
that they may believe that the lord god of their fathers , the god of abraham , the god of isaac , and the god of jacob , hath appeared unto thee .

from sihor , which is before egypt , even unto the borders of ekron northward , which is counted to the canaanite : five lords of the philistines ; the gazathites , and the ashdothites , the eshkalonites , the gittites , and the ekronites ; also the avites :
this is the land that yet remaineth : all the borders of the philistines , and all geshuri ,
now joshua was old and stricken in years ; and the lord said unto him , thou art old and stricken in years , and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed .
now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes , and the half tribe of manasseh ,
all the inhabitants of the hill country from lebanon unto misrephoth - maim , and all the sidonians , them will i drive out from before the children of israel : only divide thou it by lot unto the israelites for an inheritance , as i have commanded thee .
and the land of the giblites , and all lebanon , toward the sunrising , from baal - gad under mount hermon unto the entering into hamath .
from the south , all the land of the canaanites , and mearah that is beside the sidonians , unto aphek , to the borders of the amorites :
from aroer , that is upon the bank of the river arnon , and the city that is in the midst of the river , and all the plain of medeba unto dibon ;
with whom the reubenites and the gadites have received their inheritance , which moses gave them , beyond jordan eastward , even as moses the servant of the lord gave them ;
so abraham returned unto his young men , and they rose up and went together to beer - sheba ; and abraham dwelt at beer - sheba .
so i went , and hid it by euphrates , as the lord commanded me .
and it came to pass after many days , that the lord said unto me , arise , go to euphrates , and take the girdle from thence , which i commanded thee to hide there .
then i went to euphrates , and digged , and took the girdle from the place where i had hid it : and , behold , the girdle was marred , it was profitable for nothing .
and the angel of the lord called unto abraham out of heaven the second time ,
thus saith the lord unto me , go and get thee a linen girdle , and put it upon thy loins , and put it not in water .
and said , by myself have i sworn , saith the lord , for because thou hast done this thing , and hast not withheld thy son , thine only son :
so i got a girdle according to the word of the lord , and put it on my loins .
that in blessing i will bless thee , and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven , and as the sand which is upon the sea shore ; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies ;
and the word of the lord came unto me the second time , saying ,
and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed ; because thou hast obeyed my voice .
take the girdle that thou hast got , which is upon thy loins , and arise , go to euphrates , and hide it there in a hole of the rock .
and he said , lay not thine hand upon the lad , neither do thou any thing unto him : for now i know that thou fearest god , seeing thou hast not withheld thy son , thine only son from me .
and abraham lifted up his eyes , and looked , and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns : and abraham went and took the ram , and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son .
and abraham called the name of that place jehovah - jireh : as it is said to this day , in the mount of the lord it shall be seen .
and abraham stretched forth his hand , and took the knife to slay his son .
and he said unto him , take me an heifer of three years old , and a she goat of three years old , and a ram of three years old , and a turtledove , and a young pigeon .
and he said , lord god , whereby shall i know that i shall inherit it ?
after these things the word of the lord came unto abram in a vision , saying , fear not , abram : i am thy shield , and thy exceeding great reward .
and abram said , behold , to me thou hast given no seed : and , lo , one born in my house is mine heir .
and abram said , lord god , what wilt thou give me , seeing i go childless , and the steward of my house is this eliezer of damascus ?
and he brought him forth abroad , and said , look now toward heaven , and tell the stars , if thou be able to number them : and he said unto him , so shall thy seed be .
and , behold , the word of the lord came unto him , saying , this shall not be thine heir ; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir .
thus saith the lord , after this manner will i mar the pride of judah , and the great pride of jerusalem .
and he said unto him , i am the lord that brought thee out of ur of the chaldees , to give thee this land to inherit it .
and he believed in the lord ; and he counted it to him for righteousness .
and his concubine , whose name was reumah , she bare also tebah , and gaham , and thahash , and maachah .
and chesed , and hazo , and pildash , and jidlaph , and bethuel .

and thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings , and your sacrifices , and your tithes , and heave offerings of your hand , and your vows , and your freewill offerings , and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks :
but unto the place which the lord your god shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there , even unto his habitation shall ye seek , and thither thou shalt come :
these are the statutes and judgments , which ye shall observe to do in the land , which the lord god of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it , all the days that ye live upon the earth .
and there ye shall eat before the lord your god , and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto , ye and your households , wherein the lord thy god hath blessed thee .
ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day , every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes .
for ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance , which the lord your god giveth you .
and he shall cleave it with the wings thereof , but shall not divide it asunder : and the priest shall burn it upon the altar , upon the wood that is upon the fire : it is a burnt sacrifice , an offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the lord .
and should not i spare nineveh , that great city , wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand ; and also much cattle ?
then said the lord , thou hast had pity on the gourd , for the which thou hast not laboured , neither madest it grow ; which came up in a night , and perished in a night :
and if his offering be of the flocks , namely , of the sheep , or of the goats , for a burnt sacrifice ; he shall bring it a male without blemish .
and he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the lord : and the priests , aaron ' s sons , shall sprinkle his blood round about upon the altar .
and he shall cut it into his pieces , with his head and his fat : and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar :
but he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water : and the priest shall bring it all , and burn it upon the altar : it is a burnt sacrifice , an offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the lord .
and if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the lord be of fowls , then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves , or of young pigeons .
and the priest shall bring it unto the altar , and wring off his head , and burn it on the altar ; and the blood thereof shall be wrung out at the side of the altar :
and he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers , and cast it beside the altar on the east part , by the place of the ashes :
and the fifth angel sounded , and i saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth : and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit .
and he opened the bottomless pit ; and there arose a smoke out of the pit , as the smoke of a great furnace ; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit .
and they had hair as the hair of women , and their teeth were as the teeth of lions .
and they had breastplates , as it were breastplates of iron ; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle .
and it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth , neither any green thing , neither any tree ; but only those men which have not the seal of god in their foreheads .
and to them it was given that they should not kill them , but that they should be tormented five months : and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion , when he striketh a man .
and in those days shall men seek death , and shall not find it ; and shall desire to die , and death shall flee from them .
and the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle ; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold , and their faces were as the faces of men .
and upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin offering .
in the first month , in the fourteenth day of the month , ye shall have the passover , a feast of seven days ; unleavened bread shall be eaten .
and so thou shalt do the seventh day of the month for every one that erreth , and for him that is simple : so shall ye reconcile the house .
in the seventh month , in the fifteenth day of the month , shall he do the like in the feast of the seven days , according to the sin offering , according to the burnt offering , and according to the meat offering , and according to the oil .
and he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah for a bullock , and an ephah for a ram , and an hin of oil for an ephah .
and seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the lord , seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days ; and a kid of the goats daily for a sin offering .
as yet i am as strong this day as i was in the day that moses sent me : as my strength was then , even so is my strength now , for war , both to go out , and to come in .
and now , behold , the lord hath kept me alive , as he said , these forty and five years , even since the lord spake this word unto moses , while the children of israel wandered in the wilderness : and now , lo , i am this day fourscore and five years old .
and elisha said unto him , go , say unto him , thou mayest certainly recover : howbeit the lord hath shewed me that he shall surely die .
and the men of ephraim gathered themselves together , and went northward , and said unto jephthah , wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of ammon , and didst not call us to go with thee ? we will burn thine house upon thee with fire .
and when i saw that ye delivered me not , i put my life in my hands , and passed over against the children of ammon , and the lord delivered them into my hand : wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day , to fight against me ?
and jephthah said unto them , i and my people were at great strife with the children of ammon ; and when i called you , ye delivered me not out of their hands .
and the gileadites took the passages of jordan before the ephraimites : and it was so , that when those ephraimites which were escaped said , let me go over ; that the men of gilead said unto him , art thou an ephraimite ? if he said , nay ;
then jephthah gathered together all the men of gilead , and fought with ephraim : and the men of gilead smote ephraim , because they said , ye gileadites are fugitives of ephraim among the ephraimites , and among the manassites .
and jephthah judged israel six years . then died jephthah the gileadite , and was buried in one of the cities of gilead .
then said they unto him , say now shibboleth : and he said sibboleth : for he could not frame to pronounce it right . then they took him , and slew him at the passages of jordan : and there fell at that time of the ephraimites forty and two thousand .
and he had thirty sons , and thirty daughters , whom he sent abroad , and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons . and he judged israel seven years .
and after him ibzan of bethlehem judged israel .
yet edom revolted from under the hand of judah unto this day . then libnah revolted at the same time .
and the rest of the acts of joram , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah ?
and joram slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of david : and ahaziah his son reigned in his stead .
in the twelfth year of joram the son of ahab king of israel did ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah begin to reign .
two and twenty years old was ahaziah when he began to reign ; and he reigned one year in jerusalem . and his mother ' s name was athaliah , the daughter of omri king of israel .
and he walked in the way of the house of ahab , and did evil in the sight of the lord , as did the house of ahab : for he was the son in law of the house of ahab .
and king joram went back to be healed in jezreel of the wounds which the syrians had given him at ramah , when he fought against hazael king of syria . and ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah went down to see joram the son of ahab in jezreel , because he was sick .
yet the lord would not destroy judah for david his servant ' s sake , as he promised him to give him alway a light , and to his children .
and hazael said , but what , is thy servant a dog , that he should do this great thing ? and elisha answered , the lord hath shewed me that thou shalt be king over syria .
so he departed from elisha , and came to his master ; who said to him , what said elisha to thee ? and he answered , he told me that thou shouldest surely recover .
nor to build houses for us to dwell in : neither have we vineyard , nor field , nor seed :
and he settled his countenance stedfastly , until he was ashamed : and the man of god wept .
thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign ; and he reigned eight years in jerusalem .
and he walked in the way of the kings of israel , as did the house of ahab : for the daughter of ahab was his wife : and he did evil in the sight of the lord .
and it came to pass on the morrow , that he took a thick cloth , and dipped it in water , and spread it on his face , so that he died : and hazael reigned in his stead .
and in the fifth year of joram the son of ahab king of israel , jehoshaphat being then king of judah , jehoram the son of jehoshaphat king of judah began to reign .
the word which came unto jeremiah from the lord in the days of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah , saying ,
go unto the house of the rechabites , and speak unto them , and bring them into the house of the lord , into one of the chambers , and give them wine to drink .
then i took jaazaniah the son of jeremiah , the son of habaziniah , and his brethren , and all his sons , and the whole house of the rechabites ;
and i brought them into the house of the lord , into the chamber of the sons of hanan , the son of igdaliah , a man of god , which was by the chamber of the princes , which was above the chamber of maaseiah the son of shallum , the keeper of the door :
and i set before the sons of the house of the rechabites pots full of wine , and cups , and i said unto them , drink ye wine .
in his days edom revolted from under the hand of judah , and made a king over themselves .
but they said , we will drink no wine : for jonadab the son of rechab our father commanded us , saying , ye shall drink no wine , neither ye , nor your sons for ever :
neither shall ye build house , nor sow seed , nor plant vineyard , nor have any : but all your days ye shall dwell in tents ; that ye may live many days in the land where ye be strangers .
thus have we obeyed the voice of jonadab the son of rechab our father in all that he hath charged us , to drink no wine all our days , we , our wives , our sons , nor our daughters ;
and the children of israel wept for moses in the plains of moab thirty days : so the days of weeping and mourning for moses were ended .
this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth ; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night , that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein : for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous , and then thou shalt have good success .
and moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died : his eye was not dim , nor his natural force abated .
only be thou strong and very courageous , that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law , which moses my servant commanded thee : turn not from it to the right hand or to the left , that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest .
be strong and of a good courage : for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land , which i sware unto their fathers to give them .
and joshua the son of nun was full of the spirit of wisdom ; for moses had laid his hands upon him : and the children of israel hearkened unto him , and did as the lord commanded moses .
there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life : as i was with moses , so i will be with thee : i will not fail thee , nor forsake thee .
from the wilderness and this lebanon even unto the great river , the river euphrates , all the land of the hittites , and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun , shall be your coast .
every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon , that have i given unto you , as i said unto moses .
moses my servant is dead ; now therefore arise , go over this jordan , thou , and all this people , unto the land which i do give to them , even to the children of israel .
now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass , that the lord spake unto joshua the son of nun , moses ' minister , saying ,
and moses went up from the plains of moab unto the mountain of nebo , to the top of pisgah , that is over against jericho . and the lord shewed him all the land of gilead , unto dan ,
and all naphtali , and the land of ephraim , and manasseh , and all the land of judah , unto the utmost sea ,
and the south , and the plain of the valley of jericho , the city of palm trees , unto zoar .
and the lord said unto him , this is the land which i sware unto abraham , unto isaac , and unto jacob , saying , i will give it unto thy seed : i have caused thee to see it with thine eyes , but thou shalt not go over thither .
so moses the servant of the lord died there in the land of moab , according to the word of the lord .
have not i commanded thee ? be strong and of a good courage ; be not afraid , neither be thou dismayed : for the lord thy god is with thee whithersoever thou goest .
and he buried him in a valley in the land of moab , over against beth - peor : but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day .
therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain ; violence covereth them as a garment .
their eyes stand out with fatness : they have more than heart could wish .
they are corrupt , and speak wickedly concerning oppression : they speak loftily .
they set their mouth against the heavens , and their tongue walketh through the earth .
how he met thee by the way , and smote the hindmost of thee , even all that were feeble behind thee , when thou wast faint and weary ; and he feared not god .
therefore it shall be , when the lord thy god hath given thee rest from all thine enemies round about , in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it , that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of amalek from under heaven ; thou shalt not forget it .
for all that do such things , and all that do unrighteously , are an abomination unto the lord thy god .
remember what amalek did unto thee by the way , when ye were come forth out of egypt ;
thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures , a great and a small .
but thou shalt have a perfect and just weight , a perfect and just measure shalt thou have : that thy days may be lengthened in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee .
then thou shalt cut off her hand , thine eye shall not pity her .
thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights , a great and a small .
and his name shall be called in israel , the house of him that hath his shoe loosed .
when men strive together one with another , and the wife of the one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him , and putteth forth her hand , and taketh him by the secrets :
the posts went out , being hastened by the king ' s commandment , and the decree was given in shushan the palace . and the king and haman sat down to drink ; but the city shushan was perplexed .
the copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people , that they should be ready against that day .
and the king took his ring from his hand , and gave it unto haman the son of hammedatha the agagite , the jews ' enemy .
and the king said unto haman , the silver is given to thee , the people also , to do with them as it seemeth good to thee .
and for the wood offering , at times appointed , and for the firstfruits . remember me , o my god , for good .
thus cleansed i them from all strangers , and appointed the wards of the priests and the levites , every one in his business ;
so the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without jerusalem once or twice .
better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right .
a man ' s heart deviseth his way : but the lord directeth his steps .
for nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom : and there shall be earthquakes in divers places , and there shall be famines and troubles : these are the beginnings of sorrows .
and i commanded the levites that they should cleanse themselves , and that they should come and keep the gates , to sanctify the sabbath day . remember me , o my god , concerning this also , and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy .
but take heed to yourselves : for they shall deliver you up to councils ; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten : and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake , for a testimony against them .
then i testified against them , and said unto them , why lodge ye about the wall ? if ye do so again , i will lay hands on you . from that time forth came they no more on the sabbath .
and their children spake half in the speech of ashdod , and could not speak in the jews ' language , but according to the language of each people .
the lord hath made all things for himself : yea , even the wicked for the day of evil .
in those days also saw i jews that had married wives of ashdod , of ammon , and of moab :
every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the lord : though hand join in hand , he shall not be unpunished .
did not solomon king of israel sin by these things ? yet among many nations was there no king like him , who was beloved of his god , and god made him king over all israel : nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin .
by mercy and truth iniquity is purged : and by the fear of the lord men depart from evil .
when a man ' s ways please the lord , he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him .
and jesus answering said unto him , seest thou these great buildings ? there shall not be left one stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down .
and one of the sons of joiada , the son of eliashib the high priest , was son in law to sanballat the horonite : therefore i chased him from me .
and as he sat upon the mount of olives over against the temple , peter and james and john and andrew asked him privately ,
shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil , to transgress against our god in marrying strange wives ?
the preparations of the heart in man , and the answer of the tongue , is from the lord .
all the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes ; but the lord weigheth the spirits .
and as he went out of the temple , one of his disciples saith unto him , master , see what manner of stones and what buildings are here !
remember them , o my god , because they have defiled the priesthood , and the covenant of the priesthood , and of the levites .
commit thy works unto the lord , and thy thoughts shall be established .
for many shall come in my name , saying , i am christ ; and shall deceive many .
and when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars , be ye not troubled : for such things must needs be ; but the end shall not be yet .
tell us , when shall these things be ? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled ?
and jesus answering them began to say , take heed lest any man deceive you :
but as for me , my feet were almost gone ; my steps had well nigh slipped .
for i was envious at the foolish , when i saw the prosperity of the wicked .
for there are no bands in their death : but their strength is firm .
they are not in trouble as other men ; neither are they plagued like other men .
but the man that shall be unclean , and shall not purify himself , that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation , because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the lord : the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon him ; he is unclean .
and it shall be a perpetual statute unto them , that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes ; and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even .
and whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean ; and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even .
truly god is good to israel , even to such as are of a clean heart .
remember me , o my god , concerning this , and wipe not out my good deeds that i have done for the house of my god , and for the offices thereof .
and i made treasurers over the treasuries , shelemiah the priest , and zadok the scribe , and of the levites , pedaiah : and next to them was hanan the son of zaccur , the son of mattaniah : for they were counted faithful , and their office was to distribute unto their brethren .
then brought all judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries .
then contended i with the rulers , and said , why is the house of god forsaken ? and i gathered them together , and set them in their place .
and i perceived that the portions of the levites had not been given them : for the levites and the singers , that did the work , were fled every one to his field .
did not your fathers thus , and did not our god bring all this evil upon us , and upon this city ? yet ye bring more wrath upon israel by profaning the sabbath .
then i contended with the nobles of judah , and said unto them , what evil thing is this that ye do , and profane the sabbath day ?
there dwelt men of tyre also therein , which brought fish , and all manner of ware , and sold on the sabbath unto the children of judah , and in jerusalem .
and the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day , and on the seventh day : and on the seventh day he shall purify himself , and wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and shall be clean at even .
and for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin , and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel :
and a clean person shall take hyssop , and dip it in the water , and sprinkle it upon the tent , and upon all the vessels , and upon the persons that were there , and upon him that touched a bone , or one slain , or one dead , or a grave :
and every open vessel , which hath no covering bound upon it , is unclean .
and whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields , or a dead body , or a bone of a man , or a grave , shall be unclean seven days .
whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead , and purifieth not himself , defileth the tabernacle of the lord ; and that soul shall be cut off from israel : because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him , he shall be unclean ; his uncleanness is yet upon him .
this is the law , when a man dieth in a tent : all that come into the tent , and all that is in the tent , shall be unclean seven days .
he that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days .
he shall purify himself with it on the third day , and on the seventh day he shall be clean : but if he purify not himself the third day , then the seventh day he shall not be clean .
and he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even : and it shall be unto the children of israel , and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them , for a statute for ever .
who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the lord , and from the glory of his power ;
seeing it is a righteous thing with god to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you ;
which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of god , that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of god , for which ye also suffer :
in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not god , and that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus christ :
and to you who are troubled rest with us , when the lord jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels ,
grace unto you , and peace , from god our father and the lord jesus christ .
and from mattanah to nahaliel : and from nahaliel to bamoth :
paul , and silvanus , and timotheus , unto the church of the thessalonians in god our father and the lord jesus christ :
the princes digged the well , the nobles of the people digged it , by the direction of the lawgiver , with their staves . and from the wilderness they went to mattanah :
so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of god for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure :
then israel sang this song , spring up , o well ; sing ye unto it :
we are bound to thank god always for you , brethren , as it is meet , because that your faith groweth exceedingly , and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth ;
and from thence they went to beer : that is the well whereof the lord spake unto moses , gather the people together , and i will give them water .
and their father israel said unto them , if it must be so now , do this ; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels , and carry down the man a present , a little balm , and a little honey , spices , and myrrh , nuts , and almonds :
and israel took all these cities : and israel dwelt in all the cities of the amorites , in heshbon , and in all the villages thereof .
for except we had lingered , surely now we had returned this second time .
for heshbon was the city of sihon the king of the amorites , who had fought against the former king of moab , and taken all his land out of his hand , even unto arnon .
take also your brother , and arise , go again unto the man :
and sihon would not suffer israel to pass through his border : but sihon gathered all his people together , and went out against israel into the wilderness : and he came to jahaz , and fought against israel .
and take double money in your hand ; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks , carry it again in your hand ; peradventure it was an oversight :
and israel smote him with the edge of the sword , and possessed his land from arnon unto jabbok , even unto the children of ammon : for the border of the children of ammon was strong .
and israel sent messengers unto sihon king of the amorites , saying ,
let me pass through thy land : we will not turn into the fields , or into the vineyards ; we will not drink of the waters of the well : but we will go along by the king ' s high way , until we be past thy borders .
and from bamoth in the valley , that is in the country of moab , to the top of pisgah , which looketh toward jeshimon .
and the men took that present , and they took double money in their hand , and benjamin ; and rose up , and went down to egypt , and stood before joseph .
and god almighty give you mercy before the man , that he may send away your other brother , and benjamin . if i be bereaved of my children , i am bereaved .
and the man did as joseph bade ; and the man brought the men into joseph ' s house .
and when joseph saw benjamin with them , he said to the ruler of his house , bring these men home , and slay , and make ready ; for these men shall dine with me at noon .
and now , little children , abide in him ; that , when he shall appear , we may have confidence , and not be ashamed before him at his coming .
if ye know that he is righteous , ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him .
these things have i written unto you concerning them that seduce you .
but the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you , and ye need not that any man teach you : but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things , and is truth , and is no lie , and even as it hath taught you , ye shall abide in him .
let that therefore abide in you , which ye have heard from the beginning . if that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you , ye also shall continue in the son , and in the father .
and this is the promise that he hath promised us , even eternal life .
who is a liar but he that denieth that jesus is the christ ? he is antichrist , that denieth the father and the son .
whosoever denieth the son , the same hath not the father : ( but ) he that acknowledgeth the son hath the father also .
from thence they removed , and pitched in the valley of zared .
from thence they removed , and pitched on the other side of arnon , which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the amorites : for arnon is the border of moab , between moab and the amorites .
wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the lord , what he did in the red sea , and in the brooks of arnon ,
and at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of ar , and lieth upon the border of moab .
and the children of israel set forward , and pitched in oboth .
and they journeyed from oboth , and pitched at ije - abarim , in the wilderness which is before moab , toward the sunrising .
they went out from us , but they were not of us ; for if they had been of us , they would no doubt have continued with us : but they went out , that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us .
but he that hateth his brother is in darkness , and walketh in darkness , and knoweth not whither he goeth , because that darkness hath blinded his eyes .
i write unto you , little children , because your sins are forgiven you for his name ' s sake .
i write unto you , fathers , because ye have known him that is from the beginning . i write unto you , young men , because ye have overcome the wicked one . i write unto you , little children , because ye have known the father .
i have written unto you , fathers , because ye have known him that is from the beginning . i have written unto you , young men , because ye are strong , and the word of god abideth in you , and ye have overcome the wicked one .
love not the world , neither the things that are in the world . if any man love the world , the love of the father is not in him .
for all that is in the world , the lust of the flesh , and the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life , is not of the father , but is of the world .
and the world passeth away , and the lust thereof : but he that doeth the will of god abideth for ever .
little children , it is the last time : and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come , even now are there many antichrists ; whereby we know that it is the last time .
and he washed his face , and went out , and refrained himself , and said , set on bread .
and joseph made haste ; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother : and he sought where to weep ; and he entered into his chamber , and wept there .
and they sat before him , the firstborn according to his birthright , and the youngest according to his youth : and the men marvelled one at another .
and they set on for him by himself , and for them by themselves , and for the egyptians , which did eat with him , by themselves : because the egyptians might not eat bread with the hebrews ; for that is an abomination unto the egyptians .
i have not written unto you because ye know not the truth , but because ye know it , and that no lie is of the truth .
but ye have an unction from the holy one , and ye know all things .
and he took and sent messes unto them from before him : but benjamin ' s mess was five times so much as any of theirs . and they drank , and were merry with him .
and joshua blessed him , and gave unto caleb the son of jephunneh hebron for an inheritance .
and the name of hebron before was kirjath - arba ; which arba was a great man among the anakims . and the land had rest from war .
hebron therefore became the inheritance of caleb the son of jephunneh the kenezite unto this day , because that he wholly followed the lord god of israel .
for there is a fire gone out of heshbon , a flame from the city of sihon : it hath consumed ar of moab , and the lords of the high places of arnon .
wherefore they that speak in proverbs say , come into heshbon , let the city of sihon be built and prepared :
woe to thee , moab ! thou art undone , o people of chemosh : he hath given his sons that escaped , and his daughters , into captivity unto sihon king of the amorites .
and said , o sir , we came indeed down at the first time to buy food :
we have shot at them ; heshbon is perished even unto dibon , and we have laid them waste even unto nophah , which reacheth unto medeba .
thus israel dwelt in the land of the amorites .
and moses sent to spy out jaazer , and they took the villages thereof , and drove out the amorites that were there .
and they turned and went up by the way of bashan : and og the king of bashan went out against them , he , and all his people , to the battle at edrei .
he that loveth his brother abideth in the light , and there is none occasion of stumbling in him .
and the man brought the men into joseph ' s house , and gave them water , and they washed their feet ; and he gave their asses provender .
and the lord said unto moses , fear him not : for i have delivered him into thy hand , and all his people , and his land ; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto sihon king of the amorites , which dwelt at heshbon .
and he said , peace be to you , fear not : your god , and the god of your father , hath given you treasure in your sacks : i had your money . and he brought simeon out unto them .
so they smote him , and his sons , and all his people , until there was none left him alive : and they possessed his land .
and other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food : we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks .
and it came to pass , when we came to the inn , that we opened our sacks , and , behold , every man ' s money was in the mouth of his sack , our money in full weight : and we have brought it again in our hand .
and they answered , thy servant our father is in good health , he is yet alive . and they bowed down their heads , and made obeisance .
and he asked them of their welfare , and said , is your father well , the old man of whom ye spake ? is he yet alive ?
and when joseph came home , they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house , and bowed themselves to him to the earth .
and they made ready the present against joseph came at noon : for they heard that they should eat bread there .
and he lifted up his eyes , and saw his brother benjamin , his mother ' s son , and said , is this your younger brother , of whom ye spake unto me ? and he said , god be gracious unto thee , my son .
unto whom i sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest .
forty years long was i grieved with this generation , and said , it is a people that do err in their heart , and they have not known my ways :
thus saith the lord , where is the bill of your mother ' s divorcement , whom i have put away ? or which of my creditors is it to whom i have sold you ? behold , for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves , and for your transgressions is your mother put away .
i clothe the heavens with blackness , and i make sackcloth their covering .
the lord god hath given me the tongue of the learned , that i should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary : he wakeneth morning by morning , he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned .
the lord god hath opened mine ear , and i was not rebellious , neither turned away back .
i gave my back to the smiters , and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair : i hid not my face from shame and spitting .
for the lord god will help me ; therefore shall i not be confounded : therefore have i set my face like a flint , and i know that i shall not be ashamed .
he is near that justifieth me ; who will contend with me ? let us stand together : who is mine adversary ? let him come near to me .
behold , the lord god will help me ; who is he that shall condemn me ? lo , they all shall wax old as a garment ; the moth shall eat them up .
then shall the children of judah and the children of israel be gathered together , and appoint themselves one head , and they shall come up out of the land : for great shall be the day of jezreel .
as the lord commanded moses , so the children of israel did , and they divided the land .
then the children of judah came unto joshua in gilgal : and caleb the son of jephunneh the kenezite said unto him , thou knowest the thing that the lord said unto moses the man of god concerning me and thee in kadesh - barnea .
for moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other side jordan : but unto the levites he gave none inheritance among them .
for the children of joseph were two tribes , manasseh and ephraim : therefore they gave no part unto the levites in the land , save cities to dwell in , with their suburbs for their cattle and for their substance .
and these are the countries which the children of israel inherited in the land of canaan , which eleazar the priest , and joshua the son of nun , and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of israel , distributed for inheritance to them .
by lot was their inheritance , as the lord commanded by the hand of moses , for the nine tribes , and for the half tribe .
and moses sware on that day , saying , surely the land whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance , and thy children ' s for ever , because thou hast wholly followed the lord my god .
forty years old was i when moses the servant of the lord sent me from kadesh - barnea to espy out the land ; and i brought him word again as it was in mine heart .
nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt : but i wholly followed the lord my god .
not because we have not power , but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us .
neither did we eat any man ' s bread for nought ; but wrought with labour and travail night and day , that we might not be chargeable to any of you :
finally , brethren , pray for us , that the word of the lord may have free course , and be glorified , even as it is with you :
and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men : for all men have not faith .
and the lord direct your hearts into the love of god , and into the patient waiting for christ .
now we command you , brethren , in the name of our lord jesus christ , that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly , and not after the tradition which he received of us .
but the lord is faithful , who shall stablish you , and keep you from evil .
and we have confidence in the lord touching you , that ye both do and will do the things which we command you .
she hath done what she could : she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying .
he that receiveth you receiveth me , and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me .
for ye have the poor with you always , and whensoever ye will ye may do them good : but me ye have not always .
and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple , verily i say unto you , he shall in no wise lose his reward .
verily i say unto you , wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world , this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her .
he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet ' s reward ; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man ' s reward .
with chedorlaomer the king of elam , and with tidal king of nations , and amraphel king of shinar , and arioch king of ellasar ; four kings with five .
and they returned , and came to en - mishpat , which is kadesh , and smote all the country of the amalekites , and also the amorites that dwelt in hazezon - tamar .
and there went out the king of sodom , and the king of gomorrah , and the king of admah , and the king of zeboiim , and the king of bela ( the same is zoar ; ) and they joined battle with them in the vale of siddim ;
but they said , not on the feast day , lest there be an uproar of the people .
and in the fourteenth year came chedorlaomer , and the kings that were with him , and smote the rephaims in ashteroth karnaim , and the zuzims in ham , and the emims in shaveh kiriathaim ,
after two days was the feast of the passover , and of unleavened bread : and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft , and put him to death .
and the horites in their mount seir , unto el - paran , which is by the wilderness .
and there were some that had indignation within themselves , and said , why was this waste of the ointment made ?
all these were joined together in the vale of siddim , which is the salt sea .
and being in bethany in the house of simon the leper , as he sat at meat , there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious ; and she brake the box , and poured it on his head .
twelve years they served chedorlaomer , and in the thirteenth year they rebelled .
and jesus said , let her alone ; why trouble ye her ? she hath wrought a good work on me .
and it came to pass in the days of amraphel king of shinar , arioch king of ellasar , chedorlaomer king of elam , and tidal king of nations ;
for it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence , and have been given to the poor . and they murmured against her .
that these made war with bera king of sodom , and with birsha king of gomorrah , shinab king of admah , and shemeber king of zeboiim , and the king of bela , which is zoar .
and the tale of the bricks , which they did make heretofore , ye shall lay upon them ; ye shall not diminish ought thereof : for they be idle ; therefore they cry , saying , let us go and sacrifice to our god .
fear ye not therefore , ye are of more value than many sparrows .
ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick , as heretofore : let them go and gather straw for themselves .
but the very hairs of your head are all numbered .
let there more work be laid upon the men , that they may labour therein ; and let them not regard vain words .
think not that i am come to send peace on earth : i came not to send peace , but a sword .
but whosoever shall deny me before men , him will i also deny before my father which is in heaven .
whosoever therefore shall confess me before men , him will i confess also before my father which is in heaven .
he that findeth his life shall lose it : and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it .
moreover they that work in fine flax , and they that weave networks , shall be confounded .
and he that taketh not his cross , and followeth after me , is not worthy of me .
the fishers also shall mourn , and all they that cast angle into the brooks shall lament , and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish .
he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me : and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me .
the paper reeds by the brooks , by the mouth of the brooks , and every thing sown by the brooks , shall wither , be driven away , and be no more .
and a man ' s foes shall be they of his own household .
and they shall turn the rivers far away ; and the brooks of defence shall be emptied and dried up : the reeds and flags shall wither .
and the waters shall fail from the sea , and the river shall be wasted and dried up .
and the egyptians will i give over into the hand of a cruel lord ; and a fierce king shall rule over them , saith the lord , the lord of hosts .
and the spirit of egypt shall fail in the midst thereof ; and i will destroy the counsel thereof : and they shall seek to the idols , and to the charmers , and to them that have familiar spirits , and to the wizards .
and uzzi begat zerahiah , and zerahiah begat meraioth ,
the burden of egypt . behold , the lord rideth upon a swift cloud , and shall come into egypt : and the idols of egypt shall be moved at his presence , and the heart of egypt shall melt in the midst of it .
meraioth begat amariah , and amariah begat ahitub ,
and i will set the egyptians against the egyptians : and they shall fight every one against his brother , and every one against his neighbour ; city against city , and kingdom against kingdom .
eleazar begat phinehas , phinehas begat abishua ,
and abishua begat bukki , and bukki begat uzzi ,
and ahimaaz begat azariah , and azariah begat johanan ,
and the sons of kohath ; amram , izhar , and hebron , and uzziel .
and the children of amram ; aaron , and moses , and miriam . the sons also of aaron ; nadab , and abihu , eleazar , and ithamar .
the sons of levi ; gershon , kohath , and merari .
and ye shall be hated of all men for my name ' s sake : but he that endureth to the end shall be saved .
and the brother shall deliver up the brother to death , and the father the child : and the children shall rise up against their parents , and cause them to be put to death .
the disciple is not above his master , nor the servant above his lord .
but when they persecute you in this city , flee ye into another : for verily i say unto you , ye shall not have gone over the cities of israel , till the son of man be come .
for it is not ye that speak , but the spirit of your father which speaketh in you .
are not two sparrows sold for a farthing ? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father .
fear them not therefore : for there is nothing covered , that shall not be revealed ; and hid , that shall not be known .
it is enough for the disciple that he be as his master , and the servant as his lord . if they have called the master of the house beelzebub , how much more shall they call them of his household ?
and fear not them which kill the body , but are not able to kill the soul : but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell .
what i tell you in darkness , that speak ye in light : and what ye hear in the ear , that preach ye upon the housetops .
so will i send upon you famine and evil beasts , and they shall bereave thee ; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee ; and i will bring the sword upon thee . i the lord have spoken it .
and pharaoh said , behold , the people of the land now are many , and ye make them rest from their burdens .
and pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people , and their officers , saying ,
and they said , the god of the hebrews hath met with us : let us go , we pray thee , three days ' journey into the desert , and sacrifice unto the lord our god ; lest he fall upon us with pestilence , or with the sword .
wherefore , as i live , saith the lord god ; surely , because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things , and with all thine abominations , therefore will i also diminish thee ; neither shall mine eye spare , neither will i have any pity .
therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee , and the sons shall eat their fathers ; and i will execute judgments in thee , and the whole remnant of thee will i scatter into all the winds .
and afterward moses and aaron went in , and told pharaoh , thus saith the lord god of israel , let my people go , that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness .
thus shall mine anger be accomplished , and i will cause my fury to rest upon them , and i will be comforted : and they shall know that i the lord have spoken it in my zeal , when i have accomplished my fury in them .
and pharaoh said , who is the lord , that i should obey his voice to let israel go ? i know not the lord , neither will i let israel go .
so it shall be a reproach and a taunt , an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that are round about thee , when i shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes . i the lord have spoken it .
moreover i will make thee waste , and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee , in the sight of all that pass by .
and if the house be worthy , let your peace come upon it : but if it be not worthy , let your peace return to you .
and when ye come into an house , salute it .
and into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter , inquire who in it is worthy ; and there abide till ye go thence .
nor scrip for your journey , neither two coats , neither shoes , nor yet staves : for the workman is worthy of his meat .
for , lo , he that formeth the mountains , and createth the wind , and declareth unto man what is his thought , that maketh the morning darkness , and treadeth upon the high places of the earth , the lord , the god of hosts , is his name .
therefore thus will i do unto thee , o israel : and because i will do this unto thee , prepare to meet thy god , o israel .
i have overthrown some of you , as god overthrew sodom and gomorrah , and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning : yet have ye not returned unto me , saith the lord .
i have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of egypt : your young men have i slain with the sword , and have taken away your horses ; and i have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils : yet have ye not returned unto me , saith the lord .
and flocks shall lie down in the midst of her , all the beasts of the nations : both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the upper lintels of it ; their voice shall sing in the windows ; desolation shall be in the thresholds : for he shall uncover the cedar work .
but when they deliver you up , take no thought how or what ye shall speak : for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak .
the lord will be terrible unto them : for he will famish all the gods of the earth ; and men shall worship him , every one from his place , even all the isles of the heathen .
but beware of men : for they will deliver you up to the councils , and they will scourge you in their synagogues ;
this shall they have for their pride , because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of the lord of hosts .
behold , i send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves : be ye therefore wise as serpents , and harmless as doves .
and he will stretch out his hand against the north , and destroy assyria ; and will make nineveh a desolation , and dry like a wilderness .
verily i say unto you , it shall be more tolerable for the land of sodom and gomorrha in the day of judgment , than for that city .
ye ethiopians also , ye shall be slain by my sword .
and whosoever shall not receive you , nor hear your words , when ye depart out of that house or city , shake off the dust of your feet .
and israel set liers in wait round about gibeah .
and the children of israel inquired of the lord , ( for the ark of the covenant of god was there in those days ,
and benjamin went forth against them out of gibeah the second day , and destroyed down to the ground of the children of israel again eighteen thousand men ; all these drew the sword .
then all the children of israel , and all the people , went up , and came unto the house of god , and wept , and sat there before the lord , and fasted that day until even , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the lord .
( and the children of israel went up and wept before the lord until even , and asked counsel of the lord , saying , shall i go up again to battle against the children of benjamin my brother ? and the lord said , go up against him . )
and the children of israel came near against the children of benjamin the second day .
and the children of benjamin came forth out of gibeah , and destroyed down to the ground of the israelites that day twenty and two thousand men .
and the people the men of israel encouraged themselves , and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day .
and the men of israel went out to battle against benjamin ; and the men of israel put themselves in array to fight against them at gibeah .
but when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke , the benjamites looked behind them , and , behold , the flame of the city ascended up to heaven .
now there was an appointed sign between the men of israel and the liers in wait , that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city .
and when the men of israel retired in the battle , benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of israel about thirty persons : for they said , surely they are smitten down before us , as in the first battle .
and there came against gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all israel , and the battle was sore : but they knew not that evil was near them .
and the lord smote benjamin before israel : and the children of israel destroyed of the benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men : all these drew the sword .
so the children of benjamin saw that they were smitten : for the men of israel gave place to the benjamites , because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside gibeah .
and the liers in wait hasted , and rushed upon gibeah ; and the liers in wait drew themselves along , and smote all the city with the edge of the sword .
and the children of israel went up against the children of benjamin on the third day , and put themselves in array against gibeah , as at other times .
and the children of benjamin said , they are smitten down before us , as at the first . but the children of israel said , let us flee , and draw them from the city unto the highways .
and all the men of israel rose up out of their place , and put themselves in array at baal - tamar : and the liers in wait of israel came forth out of their places , even out of the meadows of gibeah .
and i saw the seven angels which stood before god ; and to them were given seven trumpets .
and when he had opened the seventh seal , there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour .
and the smoke of the incense , which came with the prayers of the saints , ascended up before god out of the angel ' s hand .
and another angel came and stood at the altar , having a golden censer ; and there was given unto him much incense , that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne .
and the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound .
thus they inclosed the benjamites round about , and chased them , and trode them down with ease over against gibeah toward the sunrising .
and the angel took the censer , and filled it with fire of the altar , and cast it into the earth : and there were voices , and thunderings , and lightnings , and an earthquake .
and there fell of benjamin eighteen thousand men ; all these were men of valour .
and the second angel sounded , and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea : and the third part of the sea became blood ;
and when the men of israel turned again , the men of benjamin were amazed : for they saw that evil was come upon them .
the first angel sounded , and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood , and they were cast upon the earth : and the third part of trees was burnt up , and all green grass was burnt up .
therefore they turned their backs before the men of israel unto the way of the wilderness ; but the battle overtook them ; and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them .
but six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock rimmon , and abode in the rock rimmon four months .
and the third part of the creatures which were in the sea , and had life , died ; and the third part of the ships were destroyed .
and the men of israel turned again upon the children of benjamin , and smote them with the edge of the sword , as well the men of every city , as the beast , and all that came to hand : also they set on fire all the cities that they came to .
and they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of rimmon : and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men ; and pursued hard after them unto gidom , and slew two thousand men of them .
so that all which fell that day of benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword ; all these were men of valour .
if there arise among you a prophet , or a dreamer of dreams , and giveth thee a sign or a wonder ,
thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet , or that dreamer of dreams : for the lord your god proveth you , to know whether ye love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul .
and the sign or the wonder come to pass , whereof he spake unto thee , saying , let us go after other gods , which thou hast not known , and let us serve them ;
ye shall walk after the lord your god , and fear him , and keep his commandments , and obey his voice , and ye shall serve him , and cleave unto him .
namely , of the gods of the people which are round about you , nigh unto thee , or far off from thee , from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth ;
thou shalt not consent unto him , nor hearken unto him ; neither shall thine eye pity him , neither shalt thou spare , neither shalt thou conceal him :
the word of the lord that came to jeremiah concerning the dearth .
and their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters : they came to the pits , and found no water ; they returned with their vessels empty ; they were ashamed and confounded , and covered their heads .
judah mourneth , and the gates thereof languish ; they are black unto the ground ; and the cry of jerusalem is gone up .
yea , the hind also calved in the field , and forsook it , because there was no grass .
because the ground is chapt , for there was no rain in the earth , the plowmen were ashamed , they covered their heads .
o lord , though our iniquities testify against us , do thou it for thy name ' s sake : for our backslidings are many ; we have sinned against thee .
and the wild asses did stand in the high places , they snuffed up the wind like dragons ; their eyes did fail , because there was no grass .
o the hope of israel , the saviour thereof in time of trouble , why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land , and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night ?
why shouldest thou be as a man astonied , as a mighty man that cannot save ? yet thou , o lord , art in the midst of us , and we are called by thy name ; leave us not .
so that a man shall say , verily there is a reward for the righteous : verily he is a god that judgeth in the earth .
the righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance : he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked .
now it came to pass after this , that nahash the king of the children of ammon died , and his son reigned in his stead .
then there went certain , and told david how the men were served . and he sent to meet them : for the men were greatly ashamed . and the king said , tarry at jericho until your beards be grown , and then return .
and when the children of ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to david , hanun and the children of ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of mesopotamia , and out of syria - maachah , and out of zobah .
so all the men of israel were gathered against the city , knit together as one man .
wherefore hanun took david ' s servants , and shaved them , and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks , and sent them away .
and the children of ammon came out , and put the battle in array before the gate of the city : and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field .
now therefore deliver us the men , the children of belial , which are in gibeah , that we may put them to death , and put away evil from israel . but the children of benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of israel :
now when joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind , he chose out of all the choice of israel , and put them in array against the syrians .
and the tribes of israel sent men through all the tribe of benjamin , saying , what wickedness is this that is done among you ?
so they hired thirty and two thousand chariots , and the king of maachah and his people ; who came and pitched before medeba . and the children of ammon gathered themselves together from their cities , and came to battle .
and the children of benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword , beside the inhabitants of gibeah , which were numbered seven hundred chosen men .
and when david heard of it , he sent joab , and all the host of the mighty men .
but the children of benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto gibeah , to go out to battle against the children of israel .
and the men of israel , beside benjamin , were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword : all these were men of war .
among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men lefthanded ; every one could sling stones at an hair breadth , and not miss .
and the children of israel rose up in the morning , and encamped against gibeah .
and the children of israel arose , and went up to the house of god , and asked counsel of god , and said , which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of benjamin ? and the lord said , judah shall go up first .
shall it be told him that i speak ? if a man speak , surely he shall be swallowed up .
and now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds : but the wind passeth , and cleanseth them .
fair weather cometh out of the north : with god is terrible majesty .
touching the almighty , we cannot find him out : he is excellent in power , and in judgment , and in plenty of justice : he will not afflict .
men do therefore fear him : he respecteth not any that are wise of heart .
thou shalt not steal .
thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour .
thou shalt not kill .
thou shalt not commit adultery .
for in six days the lord made heaven and earth , the sea , and all that in them is , and rested the seventh day : wherefore the lord blessed the sabbath day , and hallowed it .
honour thy father and thy mother : that thy days may be long upon the land which the lord thy god giveth thee .
but the seventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy god : in it thou shalt not do any work , thou , nor thy son , nor thy daughter , thy manservant , nor thy maidservant , nor thy cattle , nor thy stranger that is within thy gates :
and they said unto moses , speak thou with us , and we will hear : but let not god speak with us , lest we die .
thou shalt not covet thy neighbour ' s house , thou shalt not covet thy neighbour ' s wife , nor his manservant , nor his maidservant , nor his ox , nor his ass , nor any thing that is thy neighbour ' s .
and all the people saw the thunderings , and the lightnings , and the noise of the trumpet , and the mountain smoking : and when the people saw it , they removed , and stood afar off .
and it is turned round about by his counsels : that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth .
he causeth it to come , whether for correction , or for his land , or for mercy .
by the breath of god frost is given : and the breadth of the waters is straitened .
also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud : he scattereth his bright cloud :
an altar of earth thou shalt make unto me , and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings , and thy peace offerings , thy sheep , and thine oxen : in all places where i record my name i will come unto thee , and i will bless thee .
and if thou wilt make me an altar of stone , thou shalt not build it of hewn stone : for if thou lift up thy tool upon it , thou hast polluted it .
and moses said unto the people , fear not : for god is come to prove you , and that his fear may be before your faces , that ye sin not .
and the people stood afar off , and moses drew near unto the thick darkness where god was .
and the lord said unto moses , thus thou shalt say unto the children of israel , ye have seen that i have talked with you from heaven .
ye shall not make with me gods of silver , neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold .
how thy garments are warm , when he quieteth the earth by the south wind ?
dost thou know the balancings of the clouds , the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge ?
dost thou know when god disposed them , and caused the light of his cloud to shine ?
hearken unto this , o job : stand still , and consider the wondrous works of god .
teach us what we shall say unto him ; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness .
hast thou with him spread out the sky , which is strong , and as a molten looking glass ?
and ye shall say unto the goodman of the house , the master saith unto thee , where is the guestchamber , where i shall eat the passover with my disciples ?
and he shall shew you a large upper room furnished : there make ready .
and he said unto them , behold , when ye are entered into the city , there shall a man meet you , bearing a pitcher of water ; follow him into the house where he entereth in .
and he took bread , and gave thanks , and brake it , and gave unto them , saying , this is my body which is given for you : this do in remembrance of me .
and he took the cup , and gave thanks , and said , take this , and divide it among yourselves :
for i say unto you , i will not drink of the fruit of the vine , until the kingdom of god shall come .
and he said unto them , with desire i have desired to eat this passover with you before i suffer :
and they went , and found as he had said unto them : and they made ready the passover .
and when the hour was come , he sat down , and the twelve apostles with him .
and he slew it ; and moses took the blood , and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger , and purified the altar , and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar , and sanctified it , to make reconciliation upon it .
and he brought the bullock for the sin offering : and aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering .
and moses brought aaron ' s sons , and put coats upon them , and girded them with girdles , and put bonnets upon them ; as the lord commanded moses .
and he poured of the anointing oil upon aaron ' s head , and anointed him , to sanctify him .
and he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times , and anointed the altar and all his vessels , both the laver and his foot , to sanctify them .
and it came to pass in the fifth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah , in the ninth month , that they proclaimed a fast before the lord to all the people in jerusalem , and to all the people that came from the cities of judah unto jerusalem .
and moses took the anointing oil , and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein , and sanctified them .
and baruch the son of neriah did according to all that jeremiah the prophet commanded him , reading in the book the words of the lord in the lord ' s house .
and he killed it ; and moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about .
and he brought the ram for the burnt offering : and aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram .
but the bullock , and his hide , his flesh , and his dung , he burnt with fire without the camp ; as the lord commanded moses .
and he took all the fat that was upon the inwards , and caul above the liver , and the two kidneys , and their fat , and moses burned it upon the altar .
then jeremiah called baruch the son of neriah : and baruch wrote from the mouth of jeremiah all the words of the lord , which he had spoken unto him , upon a roll of a book .
and jeremiah commanded baruch , saying , i am shut up ; i cannot go into the house of the lord :
therefore go thou , and read in the roll , which thou hast written from my mouth , the words of the lord in the ears of the people in the lord ' s house upon the fasting day : and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all judah that come out of their cities .
it may be they will present their supplication before the lord , and will return every one from his evil way : for great is the anger and the fury that the lord hath pronounced against this people .
and it came to pass in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah , that this word came unto jeremiah from the lord , saying ,
take thee a roll of a book , and write therein all the words that i have spoken unto thee against israel , and against judah , and against all the nations , from the day i spake unto thee , from the days of josiah , even unto this day .
it may be that the house of judah will hear all the evil which i purpose to do unto them ; that they may return every man from his evil way ; that i may forgive their iniquity and their sin .
and the angel of the lord appeared unto the woman , and said unto her , behold now , thou art barren , and bearest not : but thou shalt conceive , and bear a son .
now therefore beware , i pray thee , and drink not wine nor strong drink , and eat not any unclean thing :
for , lo , thou shalt conceive , and bear a son ; and no rasor shall come on his head : for the child shall be a nazarite unto god from the womb : and he shall begin to deliver israel out of the hand of the philistines .
and the captivity of this host of the children of israel shall possess that of the canaanites , even unto zarephath ; and the captivity of jerusalem , which is in sepharad , shall possess the cities of the south .
then the woman came and told her husband , saying , a man of god came unto me , and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of god , very terrible : but i asked him not whence he was , neither told he me his name :
and the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the lord ; and the lord delivered them into the hand of the philistines forty years .
and there was a certain man of zorah , of the family of the danites , whose name was manoah ; and his wife was barren , and bare not .
but he said unto me , behold , thou shalt conceive , and bear a son ; and now drink no wine nor strong drink , neither eat any unclean thing : for the child shall be a nazarite to god from the womb to the day of his death .
then manoah intreated the lord , and said , o my lord , let the man of god which thou didst send come again unto us , and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born .
and saviours shall come up on mount zion to judge the mount of esau ; and the kingdom shall be the lord ' s .
and god hearkened to the voice of manoah ; and the angel of god came again unto the woman as she sat in the field : but manoah her husband was not with her .
and naomi said unto her daughter in law , blessed be he of the lord , who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead . and naomi said unto her , the man is near of kin unto us , one of our next kinsmen .
and they of the south shall possess the mount of esau ; and they of the plain the philistines : and they shall possess the fields of ephraim , and the fields of samaria : and benjamin shall possess gilead .
so she kept fast by the maidens of boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest ; and dwelt with her mother in law .
and ruth the moabitess said , he said unto me also , thou shalt keep fast by my young men , until they have ended all my harvest .
and naomi said unto ruth her daughter in law , it is good , my daughter , that thou go out with his maidens , that they meet thee not in any other field .
thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity ; yea , thou shouldest not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity , nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity ;
but thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger ; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of judah in the day of their destruction ; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress .
in the day that thou stoodest on the other side , in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces , and foreigners entered into his gates , and cast lots upon jerusalem , even thou wast as one of them .
for thy violence against thy brother jacob shame shall cover thee , and thou shalt be cut off for ever .
but upon mount zion shall be deliverance , and there shall be holiness ; and the house of jacob shall possess their possessions .
for as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain , so shall all the heathen drink continually , yea , they shall drink , and they shall swallow down , and they shall be as though they had not been .
for the day of the lord is near upon all the heathen : as thou hast done , it shall be done unto thee : thy reward shall return upon thine own head .
neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway , to cut off those of his that did escape ; neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of distress .
then she fell on her face , and bowed herself to the ground , and said unto him , why have i found grace in thine eyes , that thou shouldest take knowledge of me , seeing i am a stranger ?
the lord recompense thy work , and a full reward be given thee of the lord god of israel , under whose wings thou art come to trust .
then she said , let me find favour in thy sight , my lord ; for that thou hast comforted me , and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid , though i be not like unto one of thine handmaidens .
and boaz said unto her , at mealtime come thou hither , and eat of the bread , and dip thy morsel in the vinegar . and she sat beside the reapers : and he reached her parched corn , and she did eat , and was sufficed , and left .
and when she was risen up to glean , boaz commanded his young men , saying , let her glean even among the sheaves , and reproach her not :
and let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her , and leave them , that she may glean them , and rebuke her not .
so she gleaned in the field until even , and beat out that she had gleaned : and it was about an ephah of barley .
and she took it up , and went into the city : and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned : and she brought forth , and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed .
and they said , what need we any further witness ? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth .
is there iniquity in gilead ? surely they are vanity : they sacrifice bullocks in gilgal ; yea , their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the fields .
i have also spoken by the prophets , and i have multiplied visions , and used similitudes , by the ministry of the prophets .
and jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to pharaoh ; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of pharaoh : he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land , of every one according to his taxation , to give it unto pharaoh - nechoh .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord , according to all that his fathers had done .
jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem . and his mother ' s name was zebudah , the daughter of pedaiah of rumah .
jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned three months in jerusalem . and his mother ' s name was hamutal , the daughter of jeremiah of libnah .
and his servants carried him in a chariot dead from megiddo , and brought him to jerusalem , and buried him in his own sepulchre . and the people of the land took jehoahaz the son of josiah , and anointed him , and made him king in his father ' s stead .
then said they all , art thou then the son of god ? and he said unto them , ye say that i am .
and pharaoh - nechoh put him in bands at riblah in the land of hamath , that he might not reign in jerusalem ; and put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver , and a talent of gold .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord , according to all that his fathers had done .
and peter went out , and wept bitterly .
and i appeared unto abraham , unto isaac , and unto jacob , by the name of god almighty , but by my name jehovah was i not known to them .
and the men that held jesus mocked him , and smote him .
and god spake unto moses , and said unto him , i am the lord :
then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness , with burnt offering and whole burnt offering : then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar .
and peter said , man , i know not what thou sayest . and immediately , while he yet spake , the cock crew .
and i have also heard the groaning of the children of israel , whom the egyptians keep in bondage ; and i have remembered my covenant .
do good in thy good pleasure unto zion : build thou the walls of jerusalem .
and the lord turned , and looked upon peter . and peter remembered the word of the lord , how he had said unto him , before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice .
and i have also established my covenant with them , to give them the land of canaan , the land of their pilgrimage , wherein they were strangers .
the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit : a broken and a contrite heart , o god , thou wilt not despise .
and as soon as it was day , the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together , and led him into their council , saying ,
behold , i say , how they reward us , to come to cast us out of thy possession , which thou hast given us to inherit .
for thou desirest not sacrifice ; else would i give it : thou delightest not in burnt offering .
art thou the christ ? tell us . and he said unto them , if i tell you , ye will not believe :
and now , behold , the children of ammon and moab and mount seir , whom thou wouldest not let israel invade , when they came out of the land of egypt , but they turned from them , and destroyed them not ;
o lord , open thou my lips ; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise .
and when they had blindfolded him , they struck him on the face , and asked him , saying , prophesy , who is it that smote thee ?
and all judah stood before the lord , with their little ones , their wives , and their children .
then the lord said unto moses , now shalt thou see what i will do to pharaoh : for with a strong hand shall he let them go , and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land .
and many other things blasphemously spake they against him .
o our god , wilt thou not judge them ? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us ; neither know we what to do : but our eyes are upon thee .
then will i teach transgressors thy ways ; and sinners shall be converted unto thee .
restore unto me the joy of thy salvation ; and uphold me with thy free spirit .
cast me not away from thy presence ; and take not thy holy spirit from me .
and if i also ask you , ye will not answer me , nor let me go .
create in me a clean heart , o god ; and renew a right spirit within me .
hereafter shall the son of man sit on the right hand of the power of god .
better is a dry morsel , and quietness therewith , than an house full of sacrifices with strife .
then upon jahaziel the son of zechariah , the son of benaiah , the son of jeiel , the son of mattaniah , a levite of the sons of asaph , came the spirit of the lord in the midst of the congregation ;
the fining pot is for silver , and the furnace for gold : but the lord trieth the hearts .
and he said , hearken ye , all judah , and ye inhabitants of jerusalem , and thou king jehoshaphat , thus saith the lord unto you , be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude ; for the battle is not yours , but god ' s .
a wicked doer giveth heed to false lips ; and a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue .
to morrow go ye down against them : behold , they come up by the cliff of ziz ; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook , before the wilderness of jeruel .
whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his maker : and he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished .
ye shall not need to fight in this battle : set yourselves , stand ye still , and see the salvation of the lord with you , o judah and jerusalem : fear not , nor be dismayed ; to morrow go out against them : for the lord will be with you .
we see not our signs : there is no more any prophet : neither is there among us any that knoweth how long .
children ' s children are the crown of old men ; and the glory of children are their fathers .
and jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground : and all judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem fell before the lord , worshipping the lord .
they said in their hearts , let us destroy them together : they have burned up all the synagogues of god in the land .
excellent speech becometh not a fool : much less do lying lips a prince .
and the levites , of the children of the kohathites , and of the children of the korhites , stood up to praise the lord god of israel with a loud voice on high .
they have cast fire into thy sanctuary , they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground .
a gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it : whithersoever it turneth , it prospereth .
but now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers .
he that covereth a transgression seeketh love ; but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends .
a man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees .
and when judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness , they looked unto the multitude , and , behold , they were dead bodies fallen to the earth , and none escaped .
for the children of ammon and moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount seir , utterly to slay and destroy them : and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of seir , every one helped to destroy another .
and when they began to sing and to praise , the lord set ambushments against the children of ammon , moab , and mount seir , which were come against judah ; and they were smitten .
and when he had consulted with the people , he appointed singers unto the lord , and that should praise the beauty of holiness , as they went out before the army , and to say , praise the lord ; for his mercy endureth for ever .
o god , why hast thou cast us off for ever ? why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture ?
remember thy congregation , which thou hast purchased of old ; the rod of thine inheritance , which thou hast redeemed ; this mount zion , wherein thou hast dwelt .
lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations ; even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary .
thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations ; they set up their ensigns for signs .
then he said , what title is that that i see ? and the men of the city told him , it is the sepulchre of the man of god , which came from judah , and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of bethel .
and as josiah turned himself , he spied the sepulchres that were there in the mount , and sent , and took the bones out of the sepulchres , and burned them upon the altar , and polluted it , according to the word of the lord which the man of god proclaimed , who proclaimed these words .
and all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of samaria , which the kings of israel had made to provoke the lord to anger , josiah took away , and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in bethel .
and the fear of god was on all the kingdoms of those countries , when they had heard that the lord fought against the enemies of israel .
and he took away the horses that the kings of judah had given to the sun , at the entering in of the house of the lord , by the chamber of nathan - melech the chamberlain , which was in the suburbs , and burned the chariots of the sun with fire .
and he defiled topheth , which is in the valley of the children of hinnom , that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to molech .
then they returned , every man of judah and jerusalem , and jehoshaphat in the forefront of them , to go again to jerusalem with joy ; for the lord had made them to rejoice over their enemies .
and they came to jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the lord .
moreover the altar that was at bethel , and the high place which jeroboam the son of nebat , who made israel to sin , had made , both that altar and the high place he brake down , and burned the high place , and stamped it small to powder , and burned the grove .
and on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of berachah ; for there they blessed the lord : therefore the name of the same place was called , the valley of berachah , unto this day .
and he brake in pieces the images , and cut down the groves , and filled their places with the bones of men .
howbeit the high places were not taken away : for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the god of their fathers .
and he walked in the way of asa his father , and departed not from it , doing that which was right in the sight of the lord .
and after this did jehoshaphat king of judah join himself with ahaziah king of israel , who did very wickedly :
now the rest of the acts of jehoshaphat , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of jehu the son of hanani , who is mentioned in the book of the kings of israel .
and jehoshaphat reigned over judah : he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign , and he reigned twenty and five years in jerusalem . and his mother ' s name was azubah the daughter of shilhi .
so the realm of jehoshaphat was quiet : for his god gave him rest round about .
and jacob fled into the country of syria , and israel served for a wife , and for a wife he kept sheep .
in his days pharaoh - nechoh king of egypt went up against the king of assyria to the river euphrates : and king josiah went against him ; and he slew him at megiddo , when he had seen him .
and by a prophet the lord brought israel out of egypt , and by a prophet was he preserved .
now the rest of the acts of josiah , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah ?
ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly : therefore shall he leave his blood upon him , and his reproach shall his lord return unto him .
and the lord said , i will remove judah also out of my sight , as i have removed israel , and will cast off this city jerusalem which i have chosen , and the house of which i said , my name shall be there .
surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the judges that judged israel , nor in all the days of the kings of israel , nor of the kings of judah ;
and the king commanded all the people , saying , keep the passover unto the lord your god , as it is written in the book of this covenant .
and he slew all the priests of the high places that were there upon the altars , and burned men ' s bones upon them , and returned to jerusalem .
and he joined himself with him to make ships to go to tarshish : and they made the ships in ezion - geber .
notwithstanding the lord turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath , wherewith his anger was kindled against judah , because of all the provocations that manasseh had provoked him withal .
then eliezer the son of dodavah of mareshah prophesied against jehoshaphat , saying , because thou hast joined thyself with ahaziah , the lord hath broken thy works . and the ships were broken , that they were not able to go to tarshish .
and like unto him was there no king before him , that turned to the lord with all his heart , and with all his soul , and with all his might , according to all the law of moses ; neither after him arose there any like him .
but in the eighteenth year of king josiah , wherein this passover was holden to the lord in jerusalem .
now we beseech you , brethren , by the coming of our lord jesus christ , and by our gathering together unto him ,
then said he unto them , but now , he that hath a purse , let him take it , and likewise his scrip : and he that hath no sword , let him sell his garment , and buy one .
and he said unto them , when i sent you without purse , and scrip , and shoes , lacked ye any thing ? and they said , nothing .
let no man deceive you by any means : for that day shall not come , except there come a falling away first , and that man of sin be revealed , the son of perdition ;
and they said , lord , behold , here are two swords . and he said unto them , it is enough .
that ye be not soon shaken in mind , or be troubled , neither by spirit , nor by word , nor by letter as from us , as that the day of christ is at hand .
for i say unto you , that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me , and he was reckoned among the transgressors : for the things concerning me have an end .
remember ye not , that , when i was yet with you , i told you these things ?
who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called god , or that is worshipped ; so that he as god sitteth in the temple of god , shewing himself that he is god .
and he came out , and went , as he was wont , to the mount of olives ; and his disciples also followed him .
for the mystery of iniquity doth already work : only he who now letteth will let , until he be taken out of the way .
and now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time .
even him , whose coming is after the working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders ,
and david went up at the saying of gad , which he spake in the name of the lord .
and then shall that wicked be revealed , whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth , and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming :
then the angel of the lord commanded gad to say to david , that david should go up , and set up an altar unto the lord in the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite .
and the child grew , and she brought him unto pharaoh ' s daughter , and he became her son . and she called his name moses : and she said , because i drew him out of the water .
that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom , and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel .
and it came to pass in those days , when moses was grown , that he went out unto his brethren , and looked on their burdens : and he spied an egyptian smiting an hebrew , one of his brethren .
and david lifted up his eyes , and saw the angel of the lord stand between the earth and the heaven , having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over jerusalem . then david and the elders of israel , who were clothed in sackcloth , fell upon their faces .
and he looked this way and that way , and when he saw that there was no man , he slew the egyptian , and hid him in the sand .
but i have prayed for thee , that thy faith fail not : and when thou art converted , strengthen thy brethren .
and when he went out the second day , behold , two men of the hebrews strove together : and he said to him that did the wrong , wherefore smitest thou thy fellow ?
and the lord said , simon , simon , behold , satan hath desired to have you , that he may sift you as wheat :
and he said , who made thee a prince and a judge over us ? intendest thou to kill me , as thou killedst the egyptian ? and moses feared , and said , surely this thing is known .
and he said , i tell thee , peter , the cock shall not crow this day , before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me .
now when pharaoh heard this thing , he sought to slay moses . but moses fled from the face of pharaoh , and dwelt in the land of midian : and he sat down by a well .
and he said unto him , lord , i am ready to go with thee , both into prison , and to death .
now the priest of midian had seven daughters : and they came and drew water , and filled the troughs to water their father ' s flock .
go and tell david , saying , thus saith the lord , i offer thee three things : choose thee one of them , that i may do it unto thee .
and moses took the breast , and waved it for a wave offering before the lord : for of the ram of consecration it was moses ' part ; as the lord commanded moses .
so gad came to david , and said unto him , thus saith the lord , choose thee
and he put all upon aaron ' s hands , and upon his sons ' hands , and waved them for a wave offering before the lord .
and moses took them from off their hands , and burnt them on the altar upon the burnt offering : they were consecrations for a sweet savour : it is an offering made by fire unto the lord .
so the lord sent pestilence upon israel : and there fell of israel seventy thousand men .
and david said unto gad , i am in a great strait : let me fall now into the hand of the lord ; for very great are his mercies : but let me not fall into the hand of man .
and he washed the inwards and the legs in water ; and moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar : it was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet savour , and an offering made by fire unto the lord ; as the lord commanded moses .
and he brought the other ram , the ram of consecration : and aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram .
and he cut the ram into pieces ; and moses burnt the head , and the pieces , and the fat .
and he took the fat , and the rump , and all the fat that was upon the inwards , and the caul above the liver , and the two kidneys , and their fat , and the right shoulder :
and out of the basket of unleavened bread , that was before the lord , he took one unleavened cake , and a cake of oiled bread , and one wafer , and put them on the fat , and upon the right shoulder :
and he slew it ; and moses took of the blood of it , and put it upon the tip of aaron ' s right ear , and upon the thumb of his right hand , and upon the great toe of his right foot .
and he brought aaron ' s sons , and moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear , and upon the thumbs of their right hands , and upon the great toes of their right feet : and moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about .
for whether is greater , he that sitteth at meat , or he that serveth ? is not he that sitteth at meat ? but i am among you as he that serveth .
but ye shall not be so : but he that is greatest among you , let him be as the younger ; and he that is chief , as he that doth serve .
and he said unto them , the kings of the gentiles exercise lordship over them ; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors .
and there was also a strife among them , which of them should be accounted the greatest .
and i appoint unto you a kingdom , as my father hath appointed unto me ;
at that time when david saw that the lord had answered him in the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite , then he sacrificed there .
and she bare him a son , and he called his name gershom : for he said , i have been a stranger in a strange land .
and the lord commanded the angel ; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof .
and it came to pass in process of time , that the king of egypt died : and the children of israel sighed by reason of the bondage , and they cried , and their cry came up unto god by reason of the bondage .
and he said unto his daughters , and where is he ? why is it that ye have left the man ? call him , that he may eat bread .
for the tabernacle of the lord , which moses made in the wilderness , and the altar of the burnt offering , were at that season in the high place at gibeon .
and moses was content to dwell with the man : and he gave moses zipporah his daughter .
and they began to inquire among themselves , which of them it was that should do this thing .
and truly the son of man goeth , as it was determined : but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed !
but , behold , the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table .
and god heard their groaning , and god remembered his covenant with abraham , with isaac , and with jacob .
and god looked upon the children of israel , and god had respect unto them .
and ornan turned back , and saw the angel ; and his four sons with him hid themselves . now ornan was threshing wheat .
and they said , an egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds , and also drew water enough for us , and watered the flock .
and as david came to ornan , ornan looked and saw david , and went out of the threshingfloor , and bowed himself to david with his face to the ground .
and when they came to reuel their father , he said , how is it that ye are come so soon to day ?
then david said to ornan , grant me the place of this threshingfloor , that i may build an altar therein unto the lord : thou shalt grant it me for the full price : that the plague may be stayed from the people .
and the shepherds came and drove them away : but moses stood up and helped them , and watered their flock .
and ornan said unto david , take it to thee , and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes : lo , i give thee the oxen also for burnt offerings , and the threshing instruments for wood , and the wheat for the meat offering ; i give it all .
and king david said to ornan , nay ; but i will verily buy it for the full price : for i will not take that which is thine for the lord , nor offer burnt offerings without cost .
so david gave to ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight .
and david built there an altar unto the lord , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings , and called upon the lord ; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering .
and moses said unto aaron and to his sons , boil the flesh at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation : and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations , as i commanded , saying , aaron and his sons shall eat it .
and that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire .
and ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation in seven days , until the days of your consecration be at an end : for seven days shall he consecrate you .
as he hath done this day , so the lord hath commanded to do , to make an atonement for you .
therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days , and keep the charge of the lord , that ye die not : for so i am commanded .
so aaron and his sons did all things which the lord commanded by the hand of moses .
and after a little while another saw him , and said , thou art also of them . and peter said , man , i am not .
and he denied him , saying , woman , i know him not .
and about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed , saying , of a truth this fellow also was with him : for he is a galilaean .
then took they him , and led him , and brought him into the high priest ' s house . and peter followed afar off .
when i was daily with you in the temple , ye stretched forth no hands against me : but this is your hour , and the power of darkness .
but a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire , and earnestly looked upon him , and said , this man was also with him .
and when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall , and were set down together , peter sat down among them .
and one of them smote the servant of the high priest , and cut off his right ear .
and jesus answered and said , suffer ye thus far . and he touched his ear , and healed him .
but david could not go before it to inquire of god : for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the lord .
when they which were about him saw what would follow , they said unto him , lord , shall we smite with the sword ?
but jesus said unto him , judas , betrayest thou the son of man with a kiss ?
and while he yet spake , behold a multitude , and he that was called judas , one of the twelve , went before them , and drew near unto jesus to kiss him .
and said unto them , why sleep ye ? rise and pray , lest ye enter into temptation .
and when he rose up from prayer , and was come to his disciples , he found them sleeping for sorrow ,
and being in an agony he prayed more earnestly : and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground .
saying , father , if thou be willing , remove this cup from me : nevertheless not my will , but thine , be done .
and he was withdrawn from them about a stone ' s cast , and kneeled down , and prayed ,
and when he was at the place , he said unto them , pray that ye enter not into temptation .
hear ye the words of this covenant , and speak unto the men of judah , and to the inhabitants of jerusalem ;
the word that came to jeremiah from the lord , saying ,
duke magdiel , duke iram : these be the dukes of edom , according to their habitations in the land of their possession : he is esau the father of the edomites .
and the lord said unto me , a conspiracy is found among the men of judah , and among the inhabitants of jerusalem .
for i earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that i brought them up out of the land of egypt , even unto this day , rising early and protesting , saying , obey my voice .
then the lord said unto me , proclaim all these words in the cities of judah , and in the streets of jerusalem , saying , hear ye the words of this covenant , and do them .
that i may perform the oath which i have sworn unto your fathers , to give them a land flowing with milk and honey , as it is this day . then answered i , and said , so be it , o lord .
which i commanded your fathers in the day that i brought them forth out of the land of egypt , from the iron furnace , saying , obey my voice , and do them , according to all which i command you : so shall ye be my people , and i will be your god :
and say thou unto them , thus saith the lord god of israel ; cursed be the man that obeyeth not the words of this covenant ,
and the chief priests accused him of many things : but he answered nothing .
and all the people of the land went into the house of baal , and brake it down ; his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly , and slew mattan the priest of baal before the altars . and the priest appointed officers over the house of the lord .
and pilate asked him , art thou the king of the jews ? and he answering said unto him , thou sayest it .
and jehoiada made a covenant between the lord and the king and the people that they should be the lord ' s people ; between the king also and the people .
but jesus yet answered nothing ; so that pilate marvelled .
and they laid hands on her ; and she went by the way by the which the horses came into the king ' s house : and there was she slain .
and pilate asked him again , saying , answerest thou nothing ? behold how many things they witness against thee .
but jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds , the officers of the host , and said unto them , have her forth without the ranges : and him that followeth her kill with the sword . for the priest had said , let her not be slain in the house of the lord .
and straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council , and bound jesus , and carried him away , and delivered him to pilate .
and to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king david ' s spears and shields , that were in the temple of the lord .
and there was one named barabbas , which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him , who had committed murder in the insurrection .
and when she looked , behold , the king stood by a pillar , as the manner was , and the princes and the trumpeters by the king , and all the people of the land rejoiced , and blew with trumpets : and athaliah rent her clothes , and cried , treason , treason .
now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner , whomsoever they desired .
and when athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people , she came to the people into the temple of the lord .
but pilate answered them , saying , will ye that i release unto you the king of the jews ?
and he brought forth the king ' s son , and put the crown upon him , and gave him the testimony ; and they made him king , and anointed him ; and they clapped their hands , and said , god save the king .
and the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them .
and hadad died , and samlah of masrekah reigned in his stead .
and samlah died , and saul of rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead .
and saul died , and baal - hanan the son of achbor reigned in his stead .
and baal - hanan the son of achbor died , and hadar reigned in his stead : and the name of his city was pau ; and his wife ' s name was mehetabel , the daughter of matred , the daughter of mezahab .
and bela the son of beor reigned in edom : and the name of his city was dinhabah .
and bela died , and jobab the son of zerah of bozrah reigned in his stead .
and jobab died , and husham of the land of temani reigned in his stead .
and husham died , and hadad the son of bedad , who smote midian in the field of moab , reigned in his stead : and the name of his city was avith .
and these are the names of the dukes that came of esau , according to their families , after their places , by their names ; duke timnah , duke alvah , duke jetheth ,
seven years old was jehoash when he began to reign .
duke kenaz , duke teman , duke mibzar ,
and all the people of the land rejoiced , and the city was in quiet : and they slew athaliah with the sword beside the king ' s house .
duke aholibamah , duke elah , duke pinon ,
and i will take you to me for a people , and i will be to you a god : and ye shall know that i am the lord your god , which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the egyptians .
wherefore say unto the children of israel , i am the lord , and i will bring you out from under the burdens of the egyptians , and i will rid you out of their bondage , and i will redeem you with a stretched out arm , and with great judgments :
and moses spake so unto the children of israel : but they hearkened not unto moses for anguish of spirit , and for cruel bondage .
and i will bring you in unto the land , concerning the which i did swear to give it to abraham , to isaac , and to jacob ; and i will give it you for an heritage : i am the lord .
yet if thou warn the wicked , and he turn not from his wickedness , nor from his wicked way , he shall die in his iniquity ; but thou hast delivered thy soul .
when i say unto the wicked , thou shalt surely die ; and thou givest him not warning , nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way , to save his life ; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity ; but his blood will i require at thine hand .
son of man , i have made thee a watchman unto the house of israel : therefore hear the word at my mouth , and give them warning from me .
and it came to pass at the end of seven days , that the word of the lord came unto me , saying ,
then i came to them of the captivity at tel - abib , that dwelt by the river of chebar , and i sat where they sat , and remained there astonished among them seven days .
so the spirit lifted me up , and took me away , and i went in bitterness , in the heat of my spirit ; but the hand of the lord was strong upon me .
i heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another , and the noise of the wheels over against them , and a noise of a great rushing .
then the spirit took me up , and i heard behind me a voice of a great rushing , saying , blessed be the glory of the lord from his place .
and go , get thee to them of the captivity , unto the children of thy people , and speak unto them , and tell them , thus saith the lord god ; whether they will hear , or whether they will forbear .
moreover he said unto me , son of man , all my words that i shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart , and hear with thine ears .
behold , i have refined thee , but not with silver ; i have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction .
for mine own sake , even for mine own sake , will i do it : for how should my name be polluted ? and i will not give my glory unto another .
o that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments ! then had thy peace been as a river , and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea :
thy seed also had been as the sand , and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof ; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me .
come ye near unto me , hear ye this ; i have not spoken in secret from the beginning ; from the time that it was , there am i : and now the lord god , and his spirit , hath sent me .
thus saith the lord , thy redeemer , the holy one of israel ; i am the lord thy god which teacheth thee to profit , which leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go .
all ye , assemble yourselves , and hear ; which among them hath declared these things ? the lord hath loved him : he will do his pleasure on babylon , and his arm shall be on the chaldeans .
i , even i , have spoken ; yea , i have called him : i have brought him , and he shall make his way prosperous .
hearken unto me , o jacob and israel , my called ; i am he ; i am the first , i also am the last .
mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth , and my right hand hath spanned the heavens : when i call unto them , they stand up together .
thou shalt not eat any abominable thing .
these are the beasts which ye shall eat : the ox , the sheep , and the goat ,
ye are the children of the lord your god : ye shall not cut yourselves , nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead .
for thou art an holy people unto the lord thy god , and the lord hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself , above all the nations that are upon the earth .
and i will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth , that thou shalt be dumb , and shalt not be to them a reprover : for they are a rebellious house .
but thou , o son of man , behold , they shall put bands upon thee , and shall bind thee with them , and thou shalt not go out among them :
but when i speak with thee , i will open thy mouth , and thou shalt say unto them , thus saith the lord god ; he that heareth , let him hear ; and he that forbeareth , let him forbear : for they are a rebellious house .
now these be the last words of david . david the son of jesse said , and the man who was raised up on high , the anointed of the god of jacob , and the sweet psalmist of israel , said ,
and the hand of the lord was there upon me ; and he said unto me , arise , go forth into the plain , and i will there talk with thee .
the spirit of the lord spake by me , and his word was in my tongue .
nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man , that the righteous sin not , and he doth not sin , he shall surely live , because he is warned ; also thou hast delivered thy soul .
then the spirit entered into me , and set me upon my feet , and spake with me , and said unto me , go , shut thyself within thine house .
in those days was hezekiah sick unto death . and isaiah the prophet the son of amoz came unto him , and said unto him , thus saith the lord , set thine house in order : for thou shalt die , and not live .
then i arose , and went forth into the plain : and , behold , the glory of the lord stood there , as the glory which i saw by the river of chebar : and i fell on my face .
then hezekiah turned his face toward the wall , and prayed unto the lord ,
and said , remember now , o lord , i beseech thee , how i have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart , and have done that which is good in thy sight . and hezekiah wept sore .
then came the word of the lord to isaiah , saying ,
go , and say to hezekiah , thus saith the lord , the god of david thy father , i have heard thy prayer , i have seen thy tears : behold , i will add unto thy days fifteen years .
and this shall be a sign unto thee from the lord , that the lord will do this thing that he hath spoken ;
and i will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of assyria : and i will defend this city .
the writing of hezekiah king of judah , when he had been sick , and was recovered of his sickness :
behold , i will bring again the shadow of the degrees , which is gone down in the sun dial of ahaz , ten degrees backward . so the sun returned ten degrees , by which degrees it was gone down .
these ye shall eat of all that are in the waters : all that have fins and scales shall ye eat :
and the swine , because it divideth the hoof , yet cheweth not the cud , it is unclean unto you : ye shall not eat of their flesh , nor touch their dead carcase .
nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud , or of them that divide the cloven hoof ; as the camel , and the hare , and the coney : for they chew the cud , but divide not the hoof ; therefore they are unclean unto you .
and every beast that parteth the hoof , and cleaveth the cleft into two claws , and cheweth the cud among the beasts , that ye shall eat .
the hart , and the roebuck , and the fallow deer , and the wild goat , and the pygarg , and the wild ox , and the chamois .
if those ordinances depart from before me , saith the lord , then the seed of israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever .
thus saith the lord ; if heaven above can be measured , and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath , i will also cast off all the seed of israel for all that they have done , saith the lord .
behold , the days come , saith the lord , that the city shall be built to the lord from the tower of hananeel unto the gate of the corner .
and the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill gareb , and shall compass about to goath .
but this shall be the covenant that i will make with the house of israel ; after those days , saith the lord , i will put my law in their inward parts , and write it in their hearts ; and will be their god , and they shall be my people .
not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers in the day that i took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of egypt ; which my covenant they brake , although i was an husband unto them , saith the lord :
thus saith the lord , which giveth the sun for a light by day , and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night , which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar ; the lord of hosts is his name :
so the levites stilled all the people , saying , hold your peace , for the day is holy ; neither be ye grieved .
behold , the days come , saith the lord , that i will make a new covenant with the house of israel , and with the house of judah :
then he said unto them , go your way , eat the fat , and drink the sweet , and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared : for this day is holy unto our lord : neither be ye sorry ; for the joy of the lord is your strength .
but every one shall die for his own iniquity : every man that eateth the sour grape , his teeth shall be set on edge .
send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from sela to the wilderness , unto the mount of the daughter of zion .
let mine outcasts dwell with thee , moab ; be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler : for the extortioner is at an end , the spoiler ceaseth , the oppressors are consumed out of the land .
take counsel , execute judgment ; make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday ; hide the outcasts ; bewray not him that wandereth .
in those days they shall say no more , the fathers have eaten a sour grape , and the children ' s teeth are set on edge .
behold , the days come , saith the lord , that i will sow the house of israel and the house of judah with the seed of man , and with the seed of beast .
and it shall come to pass , that like as i have watched over them , to pluck up , and to break down , and to throw down , and to destroy , and to afflict ; so will i watch over them , to build , and to plant , saith the lord .
for i have satiated the weary soul , and i have replenished every sorrowful soul .
upon this i awaked , and beheld ; and my sleep was sweet unto me .
and there shall dwell in judah itself , and in all the cities thereof together , husbandmen , and they that go forth with flocks .
thus saith the lord of hosts , the god of israel ; as yet they shall use this speech in the land of judah and in the cities thereof , when i shall bring again their captivity ; the lord bless thee , o habitation of justice , and mountain of holiness .
how long wilt thou go about , o thou backsliding daughter ? for the lord hath created a new thing in the earth , a woman shall compass a man .
set thee up waymarks , make thee high heaps : set thine heart toward the highway , even the way which thou wentest : turn again , o virgin of israel , turn again to these thy cities .
is ephraim my dear son ? is he a pleasant child ? for since i spake against him , i do earnestly remember him still : therefore my bowels are troubled for him ; i will surely have mercy upon him , saith the lord .
for the fields of heshbon languish , and the vine of sibmah : the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof , they are come even unto jazer , they wandered through the wilderness : her branches are stretched out , they are gone over the sea .
therefore i will bewail with the weeping of jazer the vine of sibmah : i will water thee with my tears , o heshbon , and elealeh : for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen .
therefore shall moab howl for moab , every one shall howl : for the foundations of kir - hareseth shall ye mourn ; surely they are stricken .
and his return was to ramah ; for there was his house ; and there he judged israel ; and there he built an altar unto the lord .
and the men of israel went out of mizpeh , and pursued the philistines , and smote them , until they came under beth - car .
then samuel took a stone , and set it between mizpeh and shen , and called the name of it eben - ezer , saying , hitherto hath the lord helped us .
and as samuel was offering up the burnt offering , the philistines drew near to battle against israel : but the lord thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the philistines , and discomfited them ; and they were smitten before israel .
and samuel judged israel all the days of his life .
and he went from year to year in circuit to bethel , and gilgal , and mizpeh , and judged israel in all those places .
so the philistines were subdued , and they came no more into the coast of israel : and the hand of the lord was against the philistines all the days of samuel .
and the cities which the philistines had taken from israel were restored to israel , from ekron even unto gath ; and the coasts thereof did israel deliver out of the hands of the philistines . and there was peace between israel and the amorites .
and the border went up by the valley of the son of hinnom unto the south side of the jebusite ; the same is jerusalem : and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of hinnom westward , which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward :
and the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the water of nephtoah , and went out to the cities of mount ephron ; and the border was drawn to baalah , which is kirjath - jearim :
and the border went up to beth - hogla , and passed along by the north of beth - arabah ; and the border went up to the stone of bohan the son of reuben :
and the whole valley of the dead bodies , and of the ashes , and all the fields unto the brook of kidron , unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east , shall be holy unto the lord ; it shall not be plucked up , nor thrown down any more for ever .
this then was the lot of the tribe of the children of judah by their families ; even to the border of edom the wilderness of zin southward was the uttermost part of the south coast .
and the east border was the salt sea , even unto the end of jordan . and their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of jordan :
and their south border was from the shore of the salt sea , from the bay that looketh southward :
and he answered , fear not : for they that be with us are more than they that be with them .
and when the servant of the man of god was risen early , and gone forth , behold , an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots . and his servant said unto him , alas , my master ! how shall we do ?
therefore sent he thither horses , and chariots , and a great host : and they came by night , and compassed the city about .
and he said , go and spy where he is , that i may send and fetch him . and it was told him , saying , behold , he is in dothan .
and when abram was ninety years old and nine , the lord appeared to abram , and said unto him , i am the almighty god ; walk before me , and be thou perfect .
and one of his servants said , none , my lord , o king : but elisha , the prophet that is in israel , telleth the king of israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber .
and i will make my covenant between me and thee , and will multiply thee exceedingly .
therefore the heart of the king of syria was sore troubled for this thing ; and he called his servants , and said unto them , will ye not shew me which of us is for the king of israel ?
and the king of israel sent to the place which the man of god told him and warned him of , and saved himself there , not once nor twice .
as for me , behold , my covenant is with thee , and thou shalt be a father of many nations .
neither shall thy name any more be called abram , but thy name shall be abraham ; for a father of many nations have i made thee .
and i will make thee exceeding fruitful , and i will make nations of thee , and kings shall come out of thee .
and i will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant , to be a god unto thee , and to thy seed after thee .
and i will give unto thee , and to thy seed after thee , the land wherein thou art a stranger , all the land of canaan , for an everlasting possession ; and i will be their god .
and god said unto abraham , thou shalt keep my covenant therefore , thou , and thy seed after thee in their generations .
and elisha said unto them , this is not the way , neither is this the city : follow me , and i will bring you to the man whom ye seek . but he led them to samaria .
and when they came down to him , elisha prayed unto the lord , and said , smite this people , i pray thee , with blindness . and he smote them with blindness according to the word of elisha .
and elisha prayed , and said , lord , i pray thee , open his eyes , that he may see . and the lord opened the eyes of the young man ; and he saw : and , behold , the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about elisha .
and there was a great famine in samaria : and , behold , they besieged it , until an ass ' s head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver , and the fourth part of a cab of dove ' s dung for five pieces of silver .
and it came to pass after this , that ben - hadad king of syria gathered all his host , and went up , and besieged samaria .
and he said , if the lord do not help thee , whence shall i help thee ? out of the barnfloor , or out of the winepress ?
and the king of israel said unto elisha , when he saw them , my father , shall i smite them ? shall i smite them ?
and it came to pass , when they were come into samaria , that elisha said , lord , open the eyes of these men , that they may see . and the lord opened their eyes , and they saw ; and , behold , they were in the midst of samaria .
and he prepared great provision for them : and when they had eaten and drunk , he sent them away , and they went to their master . so the bands of syria came no more into the land of israel .
and he answered , thou shalt not smite them : wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow ? set bread and water before them , that they may eat and drink , and go to their master .
so we boiled my son , and did eat him : and i said unto her on the next day , give thy son , that we may eat him : and she hath hid her son .
and the king said unto her , what aileth thee ? and she answered , this woman said unto me , give thy son , that we may eat him to day , and we will eat my son to morrow .
and while he yet talked with them , behold , the messenger came down unto him : and he said , behold , this evil is of the lord ; what should i wait for the lord any longer ?
then he said , god do so and more also to me , if the head of elisha the son of shaphat shall stand on him this day .
then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance , both young men and old together : for i will turn their mourning into joy , and will comfort them , and make them rejoice from their sorrow .
hear the word of the lord , o ye nations , and declare it in the isles afar off , and say , he that scattered israel will gather him , and keep him , as a shepherd doth his flock .
for the lord hath redeemed jacob , and ransomed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he .
and there is hope in thine end , saith the lord , that thy children shall come again to their own border .
thus saith the lord ; refrain thy voice from weeping , and thine eyes from tears : for thy work shall be rewarded , saith the lord ; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy .
thus saith the lord ; a voice was heard in ramah , lamentation , and bitter weeping ; rahel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children , because they were not .
and i will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness , and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness , saith the lord .
and , behold , i send the promise of my father upon you : but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem , until ye be endued with power from on high .
and ye are witnesses of these things .
surely after that i was turned , i repented ; and after that i was instructed , i smote upon my thigh : i was ashamed , yea , even confounded , because i did bear the reproach of my youth .
i have surely heard ephraim bemoaning himself thus ; thou hast chastised me , and i was chastised , as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke : turn thou me , and i shall be turned ; for thou art the lord my god .
then opened he their understanding , that they might understand the scriptures ,
and he said unto them , these are the words which i spake unto you , while i was yet with you , that all things must be fulfilled , which were written in the law of moses , and in the prophets , and in the psalms , concerning me .
and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations , beginning at jerusalem .
and said unto them , thus it is written , and thus it behoved christ to suffer , and to rise from the dead the third day :
and while they yet believed not for joy , and wondered , he said unto them , have ye here any meat ?
and when he had thus spoken , he shewed them his hands and his feet .
and he took it , and did eat before them .
and they gave him a piece of a broiled fish , and of an honeycomb .
and he led them out as far as to bethany , and he lifted up his hands , and blessed them .
and were continually in the temple , praising and blessing god . amen .
and it came to pass , while he blessed them , he was parted from them , and carried up into heaven .
although my house be not so with god ; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant , ordered in all things , and sure : for this is all my salvation , and all my desire , although he make it not to grow .
but the sons of belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away , because they cannot be taken with hands :
the god of israel said , the rock of israel spake to me , he that ruleth over men must be just , ruling in the fear of god .
and he shall be as the light of the morning , when the sun riseth , even a morning without clouds ; as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain .
and after him was eleazar the son of dodo the ahohite , one of the three mighty men with david , when they defied the philistines that were there gathered together to battle , and the men of israel were gone away :
but the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear ; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place .
these be the names of the mighty men whom david had : the tachmonite that sat in the seat , chief among the captains ; the same was adino the eznite : he lift up his spear against eight hundred , whom he slew at one time .
there is no peace , saith the lord , unto the wicked .
and they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts : he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them : he clave the rock also , and the waters gushed out .
go ye forth of babylon , flee ye from the chaldeans , with a voice of singing declare ye , tell this , utter it even to the end of the earth ; say ye , the lord hath redeemed his servant jacob .
duke dishon , duke ezer , duke dishan : these are the dukes that came of hori , among their dukes in the land of seir .
and these are the kings that reigned in the land of edom , before there reigned any king over the children of israel .
these are the dukes that came of the horites ; duke lotan , duke shobal , duke zibeon , duke anah ,
and the children of lotan were hori and hemam ; and lotan ' s sister was timna .
and dishon , and ezer , and dishan : these are the dukes of the horites , the children of seir in the land of edom .
and these are the children of zibeon ; both ajah , and anah : this was that anah that found the mules in the wilderness , as he fed the asses of zibeon his father .
and the children of shobal were these ; alvan , and manahath , and ebal , shepho , and onam .
and these are the children of dishon ; hemdan , and eshban , and ithran , and cheran .

and these are the sons of reuel ; nahath , and zerah , shammah , and mizzah : these were the sons of bashemath esau ' s wife .
and timna was concubine to eliphaz esau ' s son ; and she bare to eliphaz amalek : these were the sons of adah esau ' s wife .
and the sons of eliphaz were teman , omar , zepho , and gatam , and kenaz .
these are the names of esau ' s sons ; eliphaz the son of adah the wife of esau , reuel the son of bashemath the wife of esau .
and these are the sons of reuel esau ' s son ; duke nahath , duke zerah , duke shammah , duke mizzah : these are the dukes that came of reuel in the land of edom ; these are the sons of bashemath esau ' s wife .
duke korah , duke gatam , and duke amalek : these are the dukes that came of eliphaz in the land of edom ; these were the sons of adah .
these were dukes of the sons of esau : the sons of eliphaz the firstborn son of esau ; duke teman , duke omar , duke zepho , duke kenaz ,
and these were the sons of aholibamah , the daughter of anah the daughter of zibeon , esau ' s wife : and she bare to esau jeush , and jaalam , and korah .
and see the land , what it is ; and the people that dwelleth therein , whether they be strong or weak , few or many ;
and moses sent them to spy out the land of canaan , and said unto them , get you up this way southward , and go up into the mountain :
these are the names of the men which moses sent to spy out the land . and moses called oshea the son of nun jehoshua .
of the tribe of gad , geuel the son of machi .
of the tribe of naphtali , nahbi the son of vophsi .

of the tribe of dan , ammiel the son of gemalli .
of the tribe of joseph , namely , of the tribe of manasseh , gaddi the son of susi .
of the tribe of zebulun , gaddiel the son of sodi .
now the sojourning of the children of israel , who dwelt in egypt , was four hundred and thirty years .
it is a night to be much observed unto the lord for bringing them out from the land of egypt : this is that night of the lord to be observed of all the children of israel in their generations .
nevertheless haman refrained himself : and when he came home , he sent and called for his friends , and zeresh his wife .
and haman told them of the glory of his riches , and the multitude of his children , and all the things wherein the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king .
but every man ' s servant that is bought for money , when thou hast circumcised him , then shall he eat thereof .
haman said moreover , yea , esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself ; and to morrow am i invited unto her also with the king .
and the lord said unto moses and aaron , this is the ordinance of the passover : there shall no stranger eat thereof :
yet all this availeth me nothing , so long as i see mordecai the jew sitting at the king ' s gate .
a foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof .
in one house shall it be eaten ; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house ; neither shall ye break a bone thereof .
yea , though they have hired among the nations , now will i gather them , and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes .
all the congregation of israel shall keep it .
and when a stranger shall sojourn with thee , and will keep the passover to the lord , let all his males be circumcised , and then let him come near and keep it ; and he shall be as one that is born in the land : for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof .
one law shall be to him that is homeborn , and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you .
they sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings , and eat it ; but the lord accepteth them not ; now will he remember their iniquity , and visit their sins : they shall return to egypt .
for israel hath forgotten his maker , and buildeth temples ; and judah hath multiplied fenced cities : but i will send a fire upon his cities , and it shall devour the palaces thereof .
because ephraim hath made many altars to sin , altars shall be unto him to sin .
i have written to him the great things of my law , but they were counted as a strange thing .
and they told him , and said , we came unto the land whither thou sentest us , and surely it floweth with milk and honey ; and this is the fruit of it .
and they went and came to moses , and to aaron , and to all the congregation of the children of israel , unto the wilderness of paran , to kadesh ; and brought back word unto them , and unto all the congregation , and shewed them the fruit of the land .
the amalekites dwell in the land of the south : and the hittites , and the jebusites , and the amorites , dwell in the mountains : and the canaanites dwell by the sea , and by the coast of jordan .
nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land , and the cities are walled , and very great : and moreover we saw the children of anak there .
and they came unto the brook of eshcol , and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes , and they bare it between two upon a staff ; and they brought of the pomegranates , and of the figs .
and they ascended by the south , and came unto hebron ; where ahiman , sheshai , and talmai , the children of anak , were . ( now hebron was built seven years before zoan in egypt . )
the place was called the brook eshcol , because of the cluster of grapes which the children of israel cut down from thence .
so they went up , and searched the land from the wilderness of zin unto rehob , as men come to hamath .
and what the land is , whether it be fat or lean , whether there be wood therein , or not . and be ye of good courage , and bring of the fruit of the land . now the time was the time of the firstripe grapes .
and the egyptians were urgent upon the people , that they might send them out of the land in haste ; for they said , we be all dead men .
also take your flocks and your herds , as ye have said , and be gone ; and bless me also .
and he called for moses and aaron by night , and said , rise up , and get you forth from among my people , both ye and the children of israel ; and go , serve the lord , as ye have said .
and pharaoh rose up in the night , he , and all his servants , and all the egyptians ; and there was a great cry in egypt ; for there was not a house where there was not one dead .
and the lord gave the people favour in the sight of the egyptians , so that they lent unto them such things as they required . and they spoiled the egyptians .
and the children of israel journeyed from rameses to succoth , about six hundred thousand on foot that were men , beside children .
and the people took their dough before it was leavened , their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders .
and nadab and abihu , the sons of aaron , took either of them his censer , and put fire therein , and put incense thereon , and offered strange fire before the lord , which he commanded them not .
and the children of israel did according to the word of moses ; and they borrowed of the egyptians jewels of silver , and jewels of gold , and raiment :
and a mixed multitude went up also with them ; and flocks , and herds , even very much cattle .
and what the land is that they dwell in , whether it be good or bad ; and what cities they be that they dwell in , whether in tents , or in strong holds ;
i am as a wonder unto many ; but thou art my strong refuge .
by thee have i been holden up from the womb : thou art he that took me out of my mother ' s bowels : my praise shall be continually of thee .
for thou art my hope , o lord god : thou art my trust from my youth .
deliver me , o my god , out of the hand of the wicked , out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man .
be thou my strong habitation , whereunto i may continually resort : thou hast given commandment to save me ; for thou art my rock and my fortress .
deliver me in thy righteousness , and cause me to escape : incline thine ear unto me , and save me .
in thee , o lord , do i put my trust : let me never be put to confusion .
ye shall eat nothing leavened ; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread .
and ye shall take a bunch of hyssop , and dip it in the blood that is in the bason , and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason ; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning .
then moses called for all the elders of israel , and said unto them , draw out and take you a lamb according to your families , and kill the passover .
that ye shall say , it is the sacrifice of the lord ' s passover , who passed over the houses of the children of israel in egypt , when he smote the egyptians , and delivered our houses . and the people bowed the head and worshipped .
and the children of israel went away , and did as the lord had commanded moses and aaron , so did they .
and it came to pass , that at midnight the lord smote all the firstborn in the land of egypt , from the firstborn of pharoah that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon ; and all the firstborn of cattle .
for the lord will pass through to smite the egyptians ; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel , and on the two side posts , the lord will pass over the door , and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you .
and ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever .
and it shall come to pass , when ye be come to the land which the lord will give you , according as he hath promised , that ye shall keep this service .
and it shall come to pass , when your children shall say unto you , what mean ye by this service ?
and zacchaeus stood , and said unto the lord ; behold , lord , the half of my goods i give to the poor ; and if i have taken any thing from any man by false accusation , i restore him fourfold .
and jesus said unto him , this day is salvation come to this house , forsomuch as he also is a son of abraham .
and he made haste , and came down , and received him joyfully .
and when they saw it , they all murmured , saying , that he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner .
and abimelech said unto abraham , what sawest thou , that thou hast done this thing ?
and yet indeed she is my sister ; she is the daughter of my father , but not the daughter of my mother ; and she became my wife .
and behold at eveningtide trouble ; and before the morning he is not . this is the portion of them that spoil us , and the lot of them that rob us .
and thus shall ye eat it ; with your loins girded , your shoes on your feet , and your staff in your hand ; and ye shall eat it in haste : it is the lord ' s passover .
and abimelech took sheep , and oxen , and menservants , and womenservants , and gave them unto abraham , and restored him sarah his wife .
the nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters : but god shall rebuke them , and they shall flee far off , and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind , and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind .
and jesus entered and passed through jericho .
and ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning ; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire .
and it came to pass , when god caused me to wander from my father ' s house , that i said unto her , this is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me ; at every place whither we shall come , say of me , he is my brother .
woe to the multitude of many people , which make a noise like the noise of the seas ; and to the rushing of nations , that make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters !
in the day shalt thou make thy plant to grow , and in the morning shalt thou make thy seed to flourish : but the harvest shall be a heap in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow .
and abimelech said , behold , my land is before thee : dwell where it pleaseth thee .
because thou hast forgotten the god of thy salvation , and hast not been mindful of the rock of thy strength , therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plants , and shalt set it with strange slips :
and he ran before , and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him : for he was to pass that way .
for the lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of abimelech , because of sarah abraham ' s wife .
and when jesus came to the place , he looked up , and saw him , and said unto him , zacchaeus , make haste , and come down ; for to day i must abide at thy house .
so abraham prayed unto god : and god healed abimelech , and his wife , and his maidservants ; and they bare children .
and , behold , there was a man named zacchaeus , which was the chief among the publicans , and he was rich .
and he sought to see jesus who he was ; and could not for the press , because he was little of stature .
in the first month , on the fourteenth day of the month at even , ye shall eat unleavened bread , until the one and twentieth day of the month at even .
seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses : for whosoever eateth that which is leavened , even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of israel , whether he be a stranger , or born in the land .
and in the first day there shall be an holy convocation , and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you ; no manner of work shall be done in them , save that which every man must eat , that only may be done of you .
and ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread ; for in this selfsame day have i brought your armies out of the land of egypt : therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever .
and this day shall be unto you for a memorial ; and ye shall keep it a feast to the lord throughout your generations ; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever .
seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread ; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses : for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day , that soul shall be cut off from israel .
for i will pass through the land of egypt this night , and will smite all the firstborn in the land of egypt , both man and beast ; and against all the gods of egypt i will execute judgment : i am the lord .
and they rose up the same hour , and returned to jerusalem , and found the eleven gathered together , and them that were with them ,
saying , the lord is risen indeed , and hath appeared to simon .
and they told what things were done in the way , and how he was known of them in breaking of bread .
and as they thus spake , jesus himself stood in the midst of them , and saith unto them , peace be unto you .
and it came to pass , as he sat at meat with them , he took bread , and blessed it , and brake , and gave to them .
and their eyes were opened , and they knew him ; and he vanished out of their sight .
and they said one to another , did not our heart burn within us , while he talked with us by the way , and while he opened to us the scriptures ?
but they were terrified and affrighted , and supposed that they had seen a spirit .
and he said unto them , why are ye troubled ? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts ?
behold my hands and my feet , that it is i myself : handle me , and see ; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones , as ye see me have .
and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre , and found it even so as the women had said : but him they saw not .
then he said unto them , o fools , and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken :
yea , and certain women also of our company made us astonished , which were early at the sepulchre ;
and when they found not his body , they came , saying , that they had also seen a vision of angels , which said that he was alive .
and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death , and have crucified him .
but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed israel : and beside all this , to day is the third day since these things were done .
and they drew nigh unto the village , whither they went : and he made as though he would have gone further .
but they constrained him , saying , abide with us : for it is toward evening , and the day is far spent . and he went in to tarry with them .
ought not christ to have suffered these things , and to enter into his glory ?
and beginning at moses and all the prophets , he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself .
cast me not off in the time of old age ; forsake me not when my strength faileth .
let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all the day .
and moses called mishael and elzaphan , the sons of uzziel the uncle of aaron , and said unto them , come near , carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp .
so they went near , and carried them in their coats out of the camp ; as moses had said .
and there went out fire from the lord , and devoured them , and they died before the lord .
it was mary magdalene , and joanna , and mary the mother of james , and other women that were with them , which told these things unto the apostles .
then moses said unto aaron , this is it that the lord spake , saying , i will be sanctified in them that come nigh me , and before all the people i will be glorified . and aaron held his peace .
and their words seemed to them as idle tales , and they believed them not .
and the lord spake unto aaron , saying ,
but the men that went up with him said , we be not able to go up against the people ; for they are stronger than we .
then arose peter , and ran unto the sepulchre ; and stooping down , he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves , and departed , wondering in himself at that which was come to pass .
do not drink wine nor strong drink , thou , nor thy sons with thee , when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation , lest ye die : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations :
and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of israel , saying , the land , through which we have gone to search it , is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof ; and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature .
and , behold , two of them went that same day to a village called emmaus , which was from jerusalem about threescore furlongs .
and moses said unto aaron , and unto eleazar and unto ithamar , his sons , uncover not your heads , neither rend your clothes ; lest ye die , and lest wrath come upon all the people : but let your brethren , the whole house of israel , bewail the burning which the lord hath kindled .
and they talked together of all these things which had happened .
and ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , lest ye die : for the anointing oil of the lord is upon you . and they did according to the word of moses .
and caleb stilled the people before moses , and said , let us go up at once , and possess it ; for we are well able to overcome it .
and it came to pass , that , while they communed together and reasoned , jesus himself drew near , and went with them .
but their eyes were holden that they should not know him .
and he said unto them , what manner of communications are these that ye have one to another , as ye walk , and are sad ?
and there we saw the giants , the sons of anak , which come of the giants : and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers , and so we were in their sight .
and the one of them , whose name was cleopas , answering said unto him , art thou only a stranger in jerusalem , and hast not known the things which are come to pass therein these days ?
and he said unto them , what things ? and they said unto him , concerning jesus of nazareth , which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before god and all the people :
thus did all the children of israel ; as the lord commanded moses and aaron , so did they .
and it came to pass the selfsame day , that the lord did bring the children of israel out of the land of egypt by their armies .
they abhor me , they flee far from me , and spare not to spit in my face .
because he hath loosed my cord , and afflicted me , they have also let loose the bridle before me .
upon my right hand rise the youth ; they push away my feet , and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction .
they mar my path , they set forward my calamity , they have no helper .
they came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters : in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me .
terrors are turned upon me : they pursue my soul as the wind : and my welfare passeth away as a cloud .
and now my soul is poured out upon me ; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me .
my bones are pierced in me in the night season : and my sinews take no rest .
by the great force of my disease is my garment changed : it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat .
and when forty years were expired , there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount sina an angel of the lord in a flame of fire in a bush .
he hath cast me into the mire , and i am become like dust and ashes .
when moses saw it , he wondered at the sight : and as he drew near to behold it , the voice of the lord came unto him ,
saying , i am the god of thy fathers , the god of abrham , and the god of isaac , and the god of jacob . then moses trembled , and durst not behold .
then said the lord to him , put off thy shoes from thy feet : for the place where thou standest is holy ground .
and seeing one of them suffer wrong , he defended him , and avenged him that was oppressed , and smote the egyptian :
and when he was full forty years old , it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of israel .
and the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove , and would have set them at one again , saying , sirs , ye are brethren ; why do ye wrong one to another ?
for he supposed his brethren would have understood how that god by his hand would deliver them : but they understood not .
the third , absalom the son of maachah the daughter of talmai king of geshur : the fourth , adonijah the son of haggith :
wilt thou kill me , as thou diddest the egyptian yesterday ?
the fifth , shephatiah of abital : the sixth , ithream by eglah his wife .
but he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away , saying , who made thee a ruler and a judge over us ?
these six were born unto him in hebron ; and there he reigned seven years and six months : and in jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years .
and these were born unto him in jerusalem ; shimea , and shobab , and nathan , and solomon , four , of bath - shua the daughter of ammiel :
then fled moses at this saying , and was a stranger in the land of madian , where he begat two sons .
ibhar also , and elishama , and eliphelet ,
and nogah , and nepheg , and japhia ,
and elishama , and eliada , and eliphelet , nine .
in the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride : but the lips of the wise shall preserve them .
he that walketh in his uprightness feareth the lord : but he that is perverse in his ways despiseth him .
a faithful witness will not lie : but a false witness will utter lies .
where no oxen are , the crib is clean : but much increase is by the strength of the ox .
and after abimelech there arose to defend israel tola the son of puah , the son of dodo , a man of issachar ; and he dwelt in shamir in mount ephraim .
every wise woman buildeth her house : but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands .
go from the presence of a foolish man , when thou perceivest not in him the lips of knowledge .
and moses was learned in all the wisdom of the egyptians , and was mighty in words and in deeds .
a scorner seeketh wisdom , and findeth it not : but knowledge is easy unto him that understandeth .
fools make a mock at sin : but among the righteous there is favour .
in which time moses was born , and was exceeding fair , and nourished up in his father ' s house three months :
the wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way : but the folly of fools is deceit .
so jacob went down into egypt , and died , he , and our fathers ,
then sent joseph , and called his father jacob to him , and all his kindred , threescore and fifteen souls .
but when jacob heard that there was corn in egypt , he sent out our fathers first .
the same dealt subtilly with our kindred , and evil entreated our fathers , so that they cast out their young children , to the end they might not live .
till another king arose , which knew not joseph .
but when the time of the promise drew nigh , which god had sworn to abraham , the people grew and multiplied in egypt ,
and were carried over into sychem , and laid in the sepulchre that abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of emmor the father of sychem .
and he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts , and they had thirty cities , which are called havoth - jair unto this day , which are in the land of gilead .
and jair died , and was buried in camon .
and he judged israel twenty and three years , and died , and was buried in shamir .
and after him arose jair , a gileadite , and judged israel twenty and two years .
and that year they vexed and oppressed the children of israel : eighteen years , all the children of israel that were on the other side jordan in the land of the amorites , which is in gilead .
moreover the children of ammon passed over jordan to fight also against judah , and against benjamin , and against the house of ephraim ; so that israel was sore distressed .
and the anger of the lord was hot against israel , and he sold them into the hands of the philistines , and into the hands of the children of ammon .
my skin is black upon me , and my bones are burned with heat .
my harp also is turned to mourning , and my organ into the voice of them that weep .
and delivered him out of all his afflictions , and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of pharaoh king of egypt ; and he made him governor over egypt and all his house .
now there came a dearth over all the land of egypt and chanaan , and great affliction : and our fathers found no sustenance .
and on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people , the priests , and the levites , unto ezra the scribe , even to understand the words of the law .
and all the people went their way to eat , and to drink , and to send portions , and to make great mirth , because they had understood the words that were declared unto them .
and they found written in the law which the lord had commanded by moses , that the children of israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month :
and all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths , and sat under the booths : for since the days of jeshua the son of nun unto that day had not the children of israel done so . and there was very great gladness .
so the people went forth , and brought them , and made themselves booths , every one upon the roof of his house , and in their courts , and in the courts of the house of god , and in the street of the water gate , and in the street of the gate of ephraim .
also day by day , from the first day unto the last day , he read in the book of the law of god . and they kept the feast seven days ; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly , according unto the manner .
know ye not , that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey , his servants ye are to whom ye obey ; whether of sin unto death , or of obedience unto righteousness ?
howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave , though they cry in his destruction .
what then ? shall we sin , because we are not under the law , but under grace ? god forbid .
did not i weep for him that was in trouble ? was not my soul grieved for the poor ?
thou liftest me up to the wind ; thou causest me to ride upon it , and dissolvest my substance .
neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin : but yield yourselves unto god , as those that are alive from the dead , and your members as instruments of righteousness unto god .
for i know that thou wilt bring me to death , and to the house appointed for all living .
let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body , that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof .
i cry unto thee , and thou dost not hear me : i stand up , and thou regardest me not .
likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin , but alive unto god through jesus christ our lord .
thou art become cruel to me : with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me .
for in that he died , he died unto sin once : but in that he liveth , he liveth unto god .
i went mourning without the sun : i stood up , and i cried in the congregation .
i speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh : for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity ; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness .
i am a brother to dragons , and a companion to owls .
being then made free from sin , ye became the servants of righteousness .
when i looked for good , then evil came unto me : and when i waited for light , there came darkness .
but god be thanked , that ye were the servants of sin , but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you .
thus saith the lord the maker thereof , the lord that formed it , to establish it ; the lord is his name ;
moreover the word of the lord came unto jeremiah the second time , while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison , saying ,
behold , i will bring it health and cure , and i will cure them , and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth .
they come to fight with the chaldeans , but it is fill them with the dead bodies of men , whom i have slain in mine anger and in my fury , and for all whose wickedness i have hid my face from this city .
for thus saith the lord , the god of israel , concerning the houses of this city , and concerning the houses of the kings of judah , which are thrown down by the mounts , and by the sword ;
call unto me , and i will answer thee , and shew thee great and mighty things , which thou knowest not .
and it shall be to me a name of joy , a praise and an honour before all the nations of the earth , which shall hear all the good that i do unto them : and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that i procure unto it .
and i will cleanse them from all their iniquity , whereby they have sinned against me ; and i will pardon all their iniquities , whereby they have sinned , and whereby they have transgressed against me .
and i will cause the captivity of judah and the captivity of israel to return , and will build them , as at the first .
for when ye were the servants of sin , ye were free from righteousness .
what fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed ? for the end of those things is death .
but now being made free from sin , and become servants to god , ye have your fruit unto holiness , and the end everlasting life .
for the wages of sin is death ; but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord .
and he kneeled down , and cried with a loud voice , lord , lay not this sin to their charge . and when he had said this , he fell asleep .
if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son , which will not obey the voice of his father , or the voice of his mother , and that , when they have chastened him , will not hearken unto them :
then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him , and bring him out unto the elders of his city , and unto the gate of his place ;
and seest among the captives a beautiful woman , and hast a desire unto her , that thou wouldest have her to thy wife ;
when thou goest forth to war against thine enemies , and the lord thy god hath delivered them into thine hands , and thou hast taken them captive ,
and she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her , and shall remain in thine house , and bewail her father and her mother a full month : and after that thou shalt go in unto her , and be her husband , and she shall be thy wife .
then thou shalt bring her home to thine house ; and she shall shave her head , and pare her nails ;
if a man have two wives , one beloved , and another hated , and they have born him children , both the beloved and the hated ; and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated :
and it shall be , if thou have no delight in her , then thou shalt let her go whither she will ; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money , thou shalt not make merchandise of her , because thou hast humbled her .
but he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn , by giving him a double portion of all that he hath : for he is the beginning of his strength ; the right of the firstborn is his .
then it shall be , when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath , that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated , which is indeed the firstborn :
and cast him out of the city , and stoned him : and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man ' s feet , whose name was saul .
and they stoned stephen , calling upon god , and saying , lord jesus , receive my spirit .
and said , behold , i see the heavens opened , and the son of man standing on the right hand of god .
then they cried out with a loud voice , and stopped their ears , and ran upon him with one accord ,
thou shalt speak all that i command thee : and aaron thy brother shall speak unto pharaoh , that he send the children of israel out of his land .
and the lord said unto moses , see , i have made thee a god to pharaoh : and aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet .
but pharaoh shall not hearken unto you , that i may lay my hand upon egypt , and bring forth mine armies , and my people the children of israel , out of the land of egypt by great judgments .
who have received the law by the disposition of angels , and have not kept it .
which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted ? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the just one ; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers :
but he , being full of the holy ghost , looked up stedfastly into heaven , and saw the glory of god , and jesus standing on the right hand of god ,
when pharaoh shall speak unto you , saying , shew a miracle for you : then thou shalt say unto aaron , take thy rod , and cast it before pharaoh , and it shall become a serpent .
when they heard these things , they were cut to the heart , and they gnashed on him with their teeth .
and moses was fourscore years old , and aaron fourscore and three years old , when they spake unto pharaoh .
now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence , in the place whither ye desire to go and to sojourn .
and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron , saying ,
and now i have this day declared it to you ; but ye have not obeyed the voice of the lord your god , nor any thing for the which he hath sent me unto you .
ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears , ye do always resist the holy ghost : as your fathers did , so do ye .
and the egyptians shall know that i am the lord , when i stretch forth mine hand upon egypt , and bring out the children of israel from among them .
and moses and aaron did as the lord commanded them , so did they .
his body shall not remain all night upon the tree , but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day ; ( for he that is hanged is accursed of god ; ) that thy land be not defiled , which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance .
and if a man have committed a sin worthy of death , and he be to be put to death , and thou hang him on a tree :
and all the men of his city shall stone him with stones , that he die : so shalt thou put evil away from among you ; and all israel shall hear , and fear .
heaven is my throne , and earth is my footstool : what house will ye build me ? saith the lord : or what is the place of my rest ?
and they shall say unto the elders of his city , this our son is stubborn and rebellious , he will not obey our voice ; he is a glutton , and a drunkard .
which also our fathers that came after brought in with jesus into the possession of the gentiles , whom god drave out before the face of our fathers , unto the days of david ;
who found favour before god , and desired to find a tabernacle for the god of jacob .
but solomon built him an house .
howbeit the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands ; as saith the prophet ,
our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness , as he had appointed , speaking unto moses , that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen .
yea , ye took up the tabernacle of moloch , and the star of your god remphan , figures which ye made to worship them : and i will carry you away beyond babylon .
then god turned , and gave them up to worship the host of heaven ; as it is written in the book of the prophets , o ye house of israel , have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness ?
and they made a calf in those days , and offered sacrifice unto the idol , and rejoiced in the works of their own hands .
saying unto aaron , make us gods to go before us : for as for this moses , which brought us out of the land of egypt , we wot not what is become of him .
but if ye say , we will not dwell in this land , neither obey the voice of the lord your god ,
and i will shew mercies unto you , that he may have mercy upon you , and cause you to return to your own land .
be not afraid of the king of babylon , of whom ye are afraid ; be not afraid of him , saith the lord : for i am with you to save you , and to deliver you from his hand .
if ye will still abide in this land , then will i build you , and not pull you down , and i will plant you , and not pluck you up : for i repent me of the evil that i have done unto you .
then it shall come to pass , that the sword , which ye feared , shall overtake you there in the land of egypt , and the famine , whereof ye were afraid , shall follow close after you there in egypt ; and there ye shall die .
so shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into egypt to sojourn there ; they shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence : and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that i will bring upon them .
this is he , that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount sina , and with our fathers : who received the lively oracles to give unto us :
saying , no ; but we will go into the land of egypt , where we shall see no war , nor hear the sound of the trumpet , nor have hunger of bread ; and there will we dwell :
to whom our fathers would not obey , but thrust him from them , and in their hearts turned back again into egypt ,
and now therefore hear the word of the lord , ye remnant of judah ; thus saith the lord of hosts , the god of israel ; if ye wholly set your faces to enter into egypt , and go to sojourn there ;
this is that moses , which said unto the children of israel , a prophet shall the lord your god raise up unto you of your brethren , like unto me ; him shall ye hear .
this moses whom they refused , saying , who made thee a ruler and a judge ? the same did god send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush .
the lord hath said concerning you , o ye remnant of judah ; go ye not into egypt : know certainly that i have admonished you this day .
now the rest of the acts of jotham , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah ?
howbeit the high places were not removed : the people sacrificed and burned incense still in the high places . he built the higher gate of the house of the lord .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord : he did according to all that his father uzziah had done .
five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign , and he reigned sixteen years in jerusalem . and his mother ' s name was jerusha , the daughter of zadok .
and jotham slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of david his father : and ahaz his son reigned in his stead .
in those days the lord began to send against judah rezin the king of syria , and pekah the son of remaliah .
and god spake all these words , saying ,
and came to the strong hold of tyre , and to all the cities of the hibites , and of the canaanites : and they went out to the south of judah , even to beer - sheba .
then they came to gilead , and to the land of tahtim - hodshi ; and they came to dan - jaan , and about to zidon ,
and joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king : and there were in israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword ; and the men of judah were five hundred thousand men .
so when they had gone through all the land , they came to jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days .
and joab said unto the king , now the lord thy god add unto the people , how many soever they be , an hundredfold , and that the eyes of my lord the king may see it : but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing ?
for the king said to joab the captain of the host , which was with him , go now through all the tribes of israel , from dan even to beer - sheba , and number ye the people , that i may know the number of the people .
and they passed over jordan , and pitched in aroer , on the right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of gad , and toward jazer :
notwithstanding the king ' s word prevailed against joab , and against the captains of the host . and joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king , to number the people of israel .
and the multitude sat about him , and they said unto him , behold , thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee .
when i heard , my belly trembled ; my lips quivered at the voice : rottenness entered into my bones , and i trembled in myself , that i might rest in the day of trouble : when he cometh up unto the people , he will invade them with his troops .
and he answered them , saying , who is my mother , or my brethren ?
although the fig tree shall not blossom , neither shall fruit be in the vines ; the labour of the olive shall fail , and the fields shall yield no meat ; the flock shall be cut off from the fold , and there shall be no herd in the stalls :
because they said , he hath an unclean spirit .
yet i will rejoice in the lord , i will joy in the god of my salvation .
the lord god is my strength , and he will make my feet like hinds ' feet , and he will make me to walk upon mine high places . to the chief singer on my stringed instruments .
for he that biddeth him god speed is partaker of his evil deeds .
having many things to write unto you , i would not write with paper and ink : but i trust to come unto you , and speak face to face , that our joy may be full .
the children of thy elect sister greet thee . amen .
and he looked round about on them which sat about him , and said , behold my mother and my brethren !
and jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly ; and he built in judah castles , and cities of store .
and he had much business in the cities of judah : and the men of war , mighty men of valour , were in jerusalem .
also some of the philistines brought jehoshaphat presents , and tribute silver ; and the arabians brought him flocks , seven thousand and seven hundred rams , and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats .
and next him was amasiah the son of zichri , who willingly offered himself unto the lord ; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valour .
and of benjamin ; eliada a mighty man of valour , and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand .
and these are the numbers of them according to the house of their fathers : of judah , the captains of thousands ; adnah the chief , and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand .
the mountains saw thee , and they trembled : the overflowing of the water passed by : the deep uttered his voice , and lifted up his hands on high .
and next to him was jehohanan the captain , and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand .
thou didst march through the land in indignation , thou didst thresh the heathen in anger .
the sun and moon stood still in their habitation : at the light of thine arrows they went , and at the shining of thy glittering spear .
and next him was jehozabad , and with him an hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war .
thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages : they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me : their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly .
these waited on the king , beside those whom the king put in the fenced cities throughout all judah .
thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people , even for salvation with thine anointed ; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked , by discovering the foundation unto the neck . selah .
and the multitude cometh together again , so that they could not so much as eat bread .
and when his friends heard of it , they went out to lay hold on him : for they said , he is beside himself .
and the scribes which came down from jerusalem said , he hath beelzebub , and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils .
and again the anger of the lord was kindled against israel , and he moved david against them to say , go , number israel and judah .
no man can enter into a strong man ' s house , and spoil his goods , except he will first bind the strong man ; and then he will spoil his house .
verily i say unto you , all sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men , and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme :
but he that shall blaspheme against the holy ghost hath never forgiveness , but is in danger of eternal damnation :
and this is the manner of the release : every creditor that lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it ; he shall not exact it of his neighbour , or of his brother ; because it is called the lord ' s release .
and he called them unto him , and said unto them in parables , how can satan cast out satan ?
of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again : but that which is thine with thy brother thine hand shall release ;
and if a kingdom be divided against itself , that kingdom cannot stand .
and if a house be divided against itself , that house cannot stand .
at the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release .
and if satan rise up against himself , and be divided , he cannot stand , but hath an end .
thou shalt not bow down thyself to them , nor serve them : for i the lord thy god am a jealous god , visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me ;
if there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land which the lord thy god giveth thee , thou shalt not harden thine heart , nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother :
thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image , or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above , or that is in the earth beneath , or that is in the water under the earth :
for the lord thy god blesseth thee , as he promised thee : and thou shalt lend unto many nations , but thou shalt not borrow ; and thou shalt reign over many nations , but they shall not reign over thee .
thou shalt have no other gods before me .
only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god , to observe to do all these commandments which i command thee this day .
i am the lord thy god , which have brought thee out of the land of egypt , out of the house of bondage .
save when there shall be no poor among you ; for the lord shall greatly bless thee in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it :
if there come any unto you , and bring not this doctrine , receive him not into your house , neither bid him god speed :
six days shalt thou labour , and do all thy work :
remember the sabbath day , to keep it holy .
thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain ; for the lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain .
beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart , saying , the seventh year , the year of release , is at hand ; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother , and thou givest him nought ; and he cry unto the lord against thee , and it be sin unto thee .
and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me , and keep my commandments .
but thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him , and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need , in that which he wanteth .
and to have power to heal sicknesses , and to cast out devils :
and he ordained twelve , that they should be with him , and that he might send them forth to preach ,
and he goeth up into a mountain , and calleth unto him whom he would : and they came unto him .
and he straitly charged them that they should not make him known .
and andrew , and philip , and bartholomew , and matthew , and thomas , and james the son of alphaeus , and thaddaeus , and simon the canaanite ,
and james the son of zebedee , and john the brother of james ; and he surnamed them boanerges , which is , the sons of thunder :
and simon he surnamed peter ;
now i beseech you , brethren , for the lord jesus christ ' s sake , and for the love of the spirit , that ye strive together with me in your prayers to god for me ;
that i may be delivered from them that do not believe in judaea ; and that my service which i have for jerusalem may be accepted of the saints ;
that i may come unto you with joy by the will of god , and may with you be refreshed .
and unclean spirits , when they saw him , fell down before him , and cried , saying , thou art the son of god .
for he had healed many ; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him , as many as had plagues .
it hath pleased them verily ; and their debtors they are . for if the gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things , their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things .
for it hath pleased them of macedonia and achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at jerusalem .
and i am sure that , when i come unto you , i shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of christ .
but now having no more place in these parts , and having a great desire these many years to come unto you ;
and when the sabbath was past , mary magdalene , and mary the mother of james , and salome , had bought sweet spices , that they might come and anoint him .
for which cause also i have been much hindered from coming to you .
and very early in the morning the first day of the week , they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun .
but now i go unto jerusalem to minister unto the saints .
and they said among themselves , who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre ?
whensoever i take my journey into spain , i will come to you : for i trust to see you in my journey , and to be brought on my way thitherward by you , if first i be somewhat filled with your company .
and when they looked , they saw that the stone was rolled away : for it was very great .
and entering into the sepulchre , they saw a young man sitting on the right side , clothed in a long white garment ; and they were affrighted .
and he saith unto them , be not affrighted : ye seek jesus of nazareth , which was crucified : he is risen ; he is not here : behold the place where they laid him .
but go your way , tell his disciples and peter that he goeth before you into galilee : there shall ye see him , as he said unto you .
the sons of judah ; pharez , hezron , and carmi , and hur , and shobal .
and ashur the father of tekoa had two wives , helah and naarah .
and penuel the father of gedor and ezer the father of hushah . these are the sons of hur , the firstborn of ephratah , the father of bethlehem .
and these were of the father of etam ; jezreel , and ishma , and idbash : and the name of their sister was hazelelponi :
and reaiah the son of shobal begat jahath ; and jahath begat ahumai and lahad . these are the families of the zorathites .
and jabez was more honourable than his brethren : and his mother called his name jabez , saying , because i bare him with sorrow .
and in that day it shall come to pass , that the glory of jacob shall be made thin , and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean .
and coz begat anub , and zobebah , and the families of aharhel the son of harum .
the fortress also shall cease from ephraim , and the kingdom from damascus , and the remnant of syria : they shall be as the glory of the children of israel , saith the lord of hosts .
and the sons of helah were , zereth , and jezoar , and ethnan .
the cities of aroer are forsaken : they shall be for flocks , which shall lie down , and none shall make them afraid .
and naarah bare him ahuzam , and hepher , and temeni , and haahashtari . these were the sons of naarah .
the burden of damascus . behold , damascus is taken away from being a city , and it shall be a ruinous heap .
in that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough , and an uppermost branch , which they left because of the children of israel : and there shall be desolation .
and he shall not look to the altars , the work of his hands , neither shall respect that which his fingers have made , either the groves , or the images .
and shallum the son of jabesh conspired against him , and smote him before the people , and slew him , and reigned in his stead .
and it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn , and reapeth the ears with his arm ; and it shall be as he that gathereth ears in the valley of rephaim .
yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it , as the shaking of an olive tree , two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough , four or five in the outmost fruitful branches thereof , saith the lord god of israel .
and pul the king of assyria came against the land : and menahem gave pul a thousand talents of silver , that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand .
in the nine and thirtieth year of azariah king of judah began menahem the son of gadi to reign over israel , and reigned ten years in samaria .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord : he departed not all his days from the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat , who made israel to sin .
and the rest of the acts of shallum , and his conspiracy which he made , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel .
then menahem smote tiphsah , and all that were therein , and the coasts thereof from tirzah : because they opened not to him , therefore he smote it ; and all the women therein that were with child he ripped up .
shallum the son of jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of uzziah king of judah ; and he reigned a full month in samaria .
and the rest of the acts of zachariah , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel .
this was the word of the lord which he spake unto jehu , saying , thy sons shall sit on the throne of israel unto the fourth generation . and so it came to pass .
and the rest of the acts of menahem , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel ?
and menahem exacted the money of israel , even of all the mighty men of wealth , of each man fifty shekels of silver , to give to the king of assyria . so the king of assyria turned back , and stayed not there in the land .
and the rest of the acts of pekahiah , and all that he did , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel .
in the two and fiftieth year of azariah king of judah pekah the son of remaliah began to reign over israel in samaria , and reigned twenty years .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord : he departed not from the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat , who made israel to sin .
in the days of pekah king of israel came tiglath - pileser king of assyria , and took ijon , and abel - beth - maachah , and jonoah , and kedesh , and hazor , and gilead , and galilee , all the land of naphtali , and carried them captive to assyria .
and menahem slept with his fathers ; and pekahiah his son reigned in his stead .
in the fiftieth year of azariah king of judah pekahiah the son of menahem began to reign over israel in samaria , and reigned two years .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord : he departed not from the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat , who made israel to sin .
but pekah the son of remaliah , a captain of his , conspired against him , and smote him in samaria , in the palace of the king ' s house , with argob and arieh , and with him fifty men of the gileadites : and he killed him , and reigned in his room .
and hoshea the son of elah made a conspiracy against pekah the son of remaliah , and smote him , and slew him , and reigned in his stead , in the twentieth year of jotham the son of uzziah .
in the second year of pekah the son of remaliah king of israel began jotham the son of uzziah king of judah to reign .
and the separate cities for the children of ephraim were among the inheritance of the children of manasseh , all the cities with their villages .
and the border went out toward the sea to michmethah on the north side ; and the border went about eastward unto taanath - shiloh , and passed by it on the east to janohah ;
and the border of the children of ephraim according to their families was thus : even the border of their inheritance on the east side was ataroth - addar , unto beth - horon the upper ;
the border went out from tappuah westward unto the river kanah ; and the goings out thereof were at the sea . this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of ephraim by their families .
and it went down from janohah to ataroth , and to naarath , and came to jericho , and went out at jordan .
and goeth out from bethel to luz , and passeth along unto the borders of archi to ataroth ,
and the lot of the children of joseph fell from jordan by jericho , unto the water of jericho on the east , to the wilderness that goeth up from jericho throughout mount bethel ,
so the children of joseph , manasseh and ephraim , took their inheritance .
and goeth down westward to the coast of japhleti , unto the coast of beth - horon the nether , and to gezer : and the goings out thereof are at the sea .
and he went in unto hagar , and she conceived : and when she saw that she had conceived , her mistress was despised in her eyes .
and sarai abram ' s wife took hagar her maid the egyptian , after abram had dwelt ten years in the land of canaan , and gave her to her husband abram to be his wife .
but abram said unto sarai , behold , thy maid is in thy hand ; do to her as it pleaseth thee . and when sarai dealt hardly with her , she fled from her face .
and sarai said unto abram , my wrong be upon thee : i have given my maid into thy bosom ; and when she saw that she had conceived , i was despised in her eyes : the lord judge between me and thee .
and sarai said unto abram , behold now , the lord hath restrained me from bearing : i pray thee , go in unto my maid ; it may be that i may obtain children by her . and abram hearkened to the voice of sarai .
now sarai abram ' s wife bare him no children : and she had an handmaid , an egyptian , whose name was hagar .
woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes , and prudent in their own sight !
then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of judah and jerusalem .
and he said , hagar , sarai ' s maid , whence camest thou ? and whither wilt thou go ? and she said , i flee from the face of my mistress sarai .
which justify the wicked for reward , and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him !
behold , i will gather thee to thy fathers , and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace , neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that i will bring upon this place , and upon the inhabitants of the same . so they brought the king word again .
and the angel of the lord found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness , by the fountain in the way to shur .
woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine , and men of strength to mingle strong drink :
and the angel of the lord said unto her , return to thy mistress , and submit thyself under her hands .
therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble , and the flame consumeth the chaff , so their root shall be as rottenness , and their blossom shall go up as dust : because they have cast away the law of the lord of hosts , and despised the word of the holy one of israel .
thus saith the lord , behold , i will bring evil upon this place , and upon the inhabitants thereof , even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of judah :
and the mean man shall be brought down , and the mighty man shall be humbled , and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled :
because they have forsaken me , and have burned incense unto other gods , that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands ; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place , and shall not be quenched .
but the lord of hosts shall be exalted in judgment , and god that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness .
and as for the king of judah , who sent you to inquire of the lord , so shall ye say unto him , thus saith the lord god of israel concerning the words which thou hast heard ;
then shall the lambs feed after their manner , and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat .
because thine heart was tender , and thou didst humble thyself before god , when thou heardest his words against this place , and against the inhabitants thereof , and humbledst thyself before me , and didst rend thy clothes , and weep before me ; i have even heard thee also , saith the lord .
woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity , and sin as it were with a cart rope :
and the king commanded hilkiah , and ahikam the son of shaphan , and abdon the son of micah , and shaphan the scribe , and asaiah a servant of the king ' s , saying ,
and hilkiah , and they that the king had appointed , went to huldah the prophetess , the wife of shallum the son of tikvath , the son of hasrah , keeper of the wardrobe ; ( now she dwelt in jerusalem in the college : ) and they spake to her to that effect .
and she answered them , thus saith the lord god of israel , tell ye the man that sent you to me ,
righteous art thou , o lord , when i plead with thee : yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments : wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper ? wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherously ?
thou hast planted them , yea , they have taken root : they grow , yea , they bring forth fruit : thou art near in their mouth , and far from their reins .
but thou , o lord , knowest me : thou hast seen me , and tried mine heart toward thee : pull them out like sheep for the slaughter , and prepare them for the day of slaughter .
how long shall the land mourn , and the herbs of every field wither , for the wickedness of them that dwell therein ? the beasts are consumed , and the birds ; because they said , he shall not see our last end .
if thou hast run with the footmen , and they have wearied thee , then how canst thou contend with horses ? and if in the land of peace , wherein thou trustedst , they wearied thee , then how wilt thou do in the swelling of jordan ?
for even thy brethren , and the house of thy father , even they have dealt treacherously with thee ; yea , they have called a multitude after thee : believe them not , though they speak fair words unto thee .
i have forsaken mine house , i have left mine heritage ; i have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies .
mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest ; it crieth out against me : therefore have i hated it .
mine heritage is unto me as a speckled bird , the birds round about are against her ; come ye , assemble all the beasts of the field , come to devour .
and in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea : and if one look unto the land , behold darkness and sorrow , and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof .
whose arrows are sharp , and all their bows bent , their horses ' hoofs shall be counted like flint , and their wheels like a whirlwind :
and he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far , and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth : and , behold , they shall come with speed swiftly :
none shall be weary nor stumble among them ; none shall slumber nor sleep ; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed , nor the latchet of their shoes be broken :
and josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of israel , and made all that were present in israel to serve , even to serve the lord their god . and all his days they departed not from following the lord , the god of their fathers .
o israel , thou hast sinned from the days of gibeah : there they stood : the battle in gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them .
therefore hell hath enlarged herself , and opened her mouth without measure : and their glory , and their multitude , and their pomp , and he that rejoiceth , shall descend into it .
for now they shall say , we have no king , because we feared not the lord ; what then should a king do to us ?
and it came to pass , when the king had heard the words of the law , that he rent his clothes .
therefore my people are gone into captivity , because they have no knowledge : and their honourable men are famished , and their multitude dried up with thirst .
they have spoken words , swearing falsely in making a covenant : thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field .
then shaphan the scribe told the king , saying , hilkiah the priest hath given me a book . and shaphan read it before the king .
and the harp , and the viol , the tabret , and pipe , and wine , are in their feasts : but they regard not the work of the lord , neither consider the operation of his hands .
israel is an empty vine , he bringeth forth fruit unto himself : according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars ; according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images .
and they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the lord , and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers , and to the hand of the workmen .
woe unto them that rise up early in the morning , that they may follow strong drink ; that continue until night , till wine inflame them !
their heart is divided ; now shall they be found faulty : he shall break down their altars , he shall spoil their images .
as for samaria , her king is cut off as the foam upon the water .
the high places also of aven , the sin of israel , shall be destroyed : the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars ; and they shall say to the mountains , cover us ; and to the hills , fall on us .
the inhabitants of samaria shall fear because of the calves of beth - aven : for the people thereof shall mourn over it , and the priests thereof that rejoiced on it , for the glory thereof , because it is departed from it .
it shall be also carried unto assyria for a present to king jareb : ephraim shall receive shame , and israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel .
even to the artificers and builders gave they it , to buy hewn stone , and timber for couplings , and to floor the houses which the kings of judah had destroyed .
and they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the lord , and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the lord , to repair and amend the house :
and hilkiah answered and said to shaphan the scribe , i have found the book of the law in the house of the lord . and hilkiah delivered the book to shaphan .
and shaphan carried the book to the king , and brought the king word back again , saying , all that was committed to thy servants , they do it .
also they were over the bearers of burdens , and were overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service : and of the levites there were scribes , and officers , and porters .
and when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the lord , hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the lord given by moses .
and the woman took and spread a covering over the well ' s mouth , and spread ground corn thereon ; and the thing was not known .
nevertheless a lad saw them , and told absalom : but they went both of them away quickly , and came to a man ' s house in bahurim , which had a well in his court ; whither they went down .
now jonathan and ahimaaz stayed by en - rogel ; for they might not be seen to come into the city : and a wench went and told them ; and they went and told king david .
now therefore send quickly , and tell david , saying , lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness , but speedily pass over ; lest the king be swallowed up , and all the people that are with him .
if thou , lord , shouldest mark iniquities , o lord , who shall stand ?
then said hushai unto zadok and to abiathar the priests , thus and thus did ahithophel counsel absalom and the elders of israel ; and thus and thus have i counselled .
lord , hear my voice : let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications .
and absalom and all the men of israel said , the counsel of hushai the archite is better than the counsel of ahithophel . for the lord had appointed to defeat the good counsel of ahithophel , to the intent that the lord might bring evil upon absalom .
out of the depths have i cried unto thee , o lord .
moreover , if he be gotten into a city , then shall all israel bring ropes to that city , and we will draw it into the river , until there be not one small stone found there .
let israel hope in the lord : for with the lord there is mercy , and with him is plenteous redemption .
my soul waiteth for the lord more than they that watch for the morning : i say , more than they that watch for the morning .
i wait for the lord , my soul doth wait , and in his word do i hope .
but there is forgiveness with thee , that thou mayest be feared .
and he shall redeem israel from all his iniquities .
in his days shall the righteous flourish ; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth .
he shall have dominion also from sea to sea , and from the river unto the ends of the earth .
they that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him ; and his enemies shall lick the dust .
therefore i counsel that all israel be generally gathered unto thee , from dan even to beer - sheba , as the sand that is by the sea for multitude ; and that thou go to battle in thine own person .
so shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found , and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground : and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one .
of their flesh shall ye not eat , and their carcase shall ye not touch ; they are unclean to you .
and the swine , though he divide the hoof , and be clovenfooted , yet he cheweth not the cud ; he is unclean to you .
and the hare , because he cheweth the cud , but divideth not the hoof ; he is unclean unto you .
and the coney , because he cheweth the cud , but divideth not the hoof ; he is unclean unto you .
nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud , or of them that divide the hoof : as the camel , because he cheweth the cud , but divideth not the hoof ; he is unclean unto you .
whatsoever parteth the hoof , and is clovenfooted , and cheweth the cud , among the beasts , that shall ye eat .
speak unto the children of israel , saying , these are the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth .
and the lord spake unto moses and to aaron , saying unto them ,
he shall judge thy people with righteousness , and thy poor with judgment .
give the king thy judgments , o god , and thy righteousness unto the king ' s son .
he shall come down like rain upon the mown grass : as showers that water the earth .
they shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure , throughout all generations .
he shall judge the poor of the people , he shall save the children of the needy , and shall break in pieces the oppressor .
these shall ye eat of all that are in the waters : whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters , in the seas , and in the rivers , them shall ye eat .
the mountains shall bring peace to the people , and the little hills , by righteousness .
and holon with her suburbs , and debir with her suburbs ,
and jattir with her suburbs , and eshtemoa with her suburbs ,
thus they gave to the children of aaron the priest hebron with her suburbs , to be a city of refuge for the slayer ; and libnah with her suburbs ,
because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily , therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil .
but the fields of the city , and the villages thereof , gave they to caleb the son of jephunneh for his possession .
and so i saw the wicked buried , who had come and gone from the place of the holy , and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done : this is also vanity .
and they gave them the city of arba the father of anak , which city is hebron , in the hill country of judah , with the suburbs thereof round about it .
but it shall not be well with the wicked , neither shall he prolong his days , which are as a shadow ; because he feareth not before god .
which the children of aaron , being of the families of the kohathites , who were of the children of levi , had : for theirs was the first lot .
though a sinner do evil an hundred times , and his days be prolonged , yet surely i know that it shall be well with them that fear god , which fear before him :
then i commended mirth , because a man hath no better thing under the sun , than to eat , and to drink , and to be merry : for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life , which god giveth him under the sun .
there is a vanity which is done upon the earth ; that there be just men , unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked ; again , there be wicked men , to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous : i said that this also is vanity .
all the cities of the children of aaron , the priests , were thirteen cities with their suburbs .
anathoth with her suburbs , and almon with her suburbs ; four cities .
and out of the tribe of benjamin , gibeon with her suburbs , geba with her suburbs ,
and ain with her suburbs , and juttah with her suburbs , and beth - shemesh with her suburbs ; nine cities out of those two tribes .
when i applied mine heart to know wisdom , and to see the business that is done upon the earth : ( for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes : )
and unto the children of gershon , of the families of the levites , out of the other half tribe of manasseh they gave golan in bashan with her suburbs , to be a city of refuge for the slayer ; and beesh - terah with her suburbs ; two cities .
and out of the tribe of issachar , kishon with her suburbs , dabareh with her suburbs ,
jarmuth with her suburbs , en - gannim with her suburbs ; four cities .
and the families of the children of kohath , the levites which remained of the children of kohath , even they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of ephraim .
for they gave them shechem with her suburbs in mount ephraim , to be a city of refuge for the slayer ; and gezer with her suburbs ,
and kibzaim with her suburbs , and beth - horon with her suburbs ; four cities .
and out of the tribe of dan , eltekeh with her suburbs , gibbethon with her suburbs ,
aijalon with her suburbs , gath - rimmon with her suburbs ; four cities .
and out of the half tribe of manasseh , tanach with her suburbs , and gath - rimmon with her suburbs ; two cities .
all the cities were ten with their suburbs for the families of the children of kohath that remained .
but wild beasts of the desert shall lie there ; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures ; and owls shall dwell there , and satyrs shall dance there .
and the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses , and dragons in their pleasant palaces : and her time is near to come , and her days shall not be prolonged .
and out of the tribe of gad , ramoth in gilead with her suburbs , to be a city of refuge for the slayer ; and mahanaim with her suburbs ,
heshbon with her suburbs , jazer with her suburbs ; four cities in all .
and jephthah said unto the elders of gilead , if ye bring me home again to fight against the children of ammon , and the lord deliver them before me , shall i be your head ?
and they said unto jephthah , come , and be our captain , that we may fight with the children of ammon .
and out of the tribe of naphtali , kedesh in galilee with her suburbs , to be a city of refuge for the slayer ; and hammoth - dor with her suburbs , and kartan with her suburbs ; three cities .
and it was so , that when the children of ammon made war against israel , the elders of gilead went to fetch jephthah out of the land of tob :
all the cities of the gershonites according to their families were thirteen cities with their suburbs .
and the elders of gilead said unto jephthah , therefore we turn again to thee now , that thou mayest go with us , and fight against the children of ammon , and be our head over all the inhabitants of gilead .
and out of the tribe of asher , mishal with her suburbs , abdon with her suburbs ,
and babylon , the glory of kingdoms , the beauty of the chaldees ' excellency , shall be as when god overthrew sodom and gomorrah .
and jephthah said unto the elders of gilead , did not ye hate me , and expel me out of my father ' s house ? and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress ?
helkath with her suburbs , and rehob with her suburbs ; four cities .
their bows also shall dash the young men to pieces ; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb ; their eye shall not spare children .
and gilead ' s wife bare him sons ; and his wife ' s sons grew up , and they thrust out jephthah , and said unto him , thou shalt not inherit in our father ' s house ; for thou art the son of a strange woman .
and out of the tribe of reuben , bezer with her suburbs , and jahazah with her suburbs ,
now jephthah the gileadite was a mighty man of valour , and he was the son of an harlot : and gilead begat jephthah .
and it came to pass in process of time , that the children of ammon made war against israel .
and unto the families of the children of merari , the rest of the levites , out of the tribe of zebulun , jokneam with her suburbs , and kartah with her suburbs ,
then jephthah fled from his brethren , and dwelt in the land of tob : and there were gathered vain men to jephthah , and went out with him .
dimnah with her suburbs , nahalal with her suburbs ; four cities .
i will make a man more precious than fine gold ; even a man than the golden wedge of ophir .
therefore i will shake the heavens , and the earth shall remove out of her place , in the wrath of the lord of hosts , and in the day of his fierce anger .
for the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light : the sun shall be darkened in his going forth , and the moon shall not cause her light to shine .
and i will punish the world for their evil , and the wicked for their iniquity ; and i will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease , and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible .
so all the cities for the children of merari by their families , which were remaining of the families of the levites , were by their lot twelve cities .
their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes ; their houses shall be spoiled , and their wives ravished .
behold , i will stir up the medes against them , which shall not regard silver ; and as for gold , they shall not delight in it .
and it shall be as the chased roe , and as a sheep that no man taketh up : they shall every man turn to his own people , and flee every one into his own land .
every one that is found shall be thrust through ; and every one that is joined unto them shall fall by the sword .
there failed not ought of any good thing which the lord had spoken unto the house of israel ; all came to pass .
all the cities of the levites within the possession of the children of israel were forty and eight cities with their suburbs .
these cities were every one with their suburbs round about them : thus were all these cities .
and the lord gave unto israel all the land which he sware to give unto their fathers ; and they possessed it , and dwelt therein .
and the lord gave them rest round about , according to all that he sware unto their fathers : and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them ; the lord delivered all their enemies into their hand .
light is sown for the righteous , and gladness for the upright in heart .
rejoice in the lord , ye righteous ; and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness .
ye that love the lord , hate evil : he preserveth the souls of his saints ; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked .
zanoah , adullam , and in their villages , at lachish , and the fields thereof , at azekah , and in the villages thereof . and they dwelt from beer - sheba unto the valley of hinnom .
the children also of benjamin from geba dwelt at michmash , and aija , and bethel , and in their villages ,
and at anathoth , nob , ananiah ,
hazor , ramah , gittaim ,
hadid , zeboim , neballat ,
lod , and ono , the valley of craftsmen .
and of the levites were divisions in judah , and in benjamin .
in the house of the righteous is much treasure : but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble .
and the residue of israel , of the priests , and the levites , were in all the cities of judah , every one in his inheritance .
a fool despiseth his father ' s instruction : but he that regardeth reproof is prudent .
the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the lord : but the prayer of the upright is his delight .
the lips of the wise disperse knowledge : but the heart of the foolish doeth not so .
for it was the king ' s commandment concerning them , that a certain portion should be for the singers , due for every day .
and pethahiah the son of meshezabeel , of the children of zerah the son of judah , was at the king ' s hand in all matters concerning the people .
the way of the wicked is an abomination unto the lord : but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness .
but the nethinims dwelt in ophel : and ziha and gispa were over the nethinims .
the overseer also of the levites at jerusalem was uzzi the son of bani , the son of hashabiah , the son of mattaniah , the son of micha . of the sons of asaph , the singers were over the business of the house of god .
and at hazar - shual , and at beer - sheba , and in the villages thereof ,
and at ziklag , and at mekonah , and in the villages thereof ,
and for the villages , with their fields , some of the children of judah dwelt at kirjath - arba , and in the villages thereof , and at dibon , and in the villages thereof , and at jekabzeel , and in the villages thereof ,
and at jeshua , and at moladah , and at beth - phelet ,
the tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright : but the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness .
a soft answer turneth away wrath : but grievous words stir up anger .
and at en - rimmon , and at zareah , and at jarmuth ,
a wholesome tongue is a tree of life : but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit .
the eyes of the lord are in every place , beholding the evil and the good .
and the lord spake unto moses , go unto pharaoh , and say unto him , thus saith the lord , let my people go , that they may serve me .
and if thou refuse to let them go , behold , i will smite all thy borders with frogs :
and the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly , which shall go up and come into thine house , and into thy bedchamber , and upon thy bed , and into the house of thy servants , and upon thy people , and into thine ovens , and into thy kneadingtroughs :
for the lord heareth the poor , and despiseth not his prisoners .
the humble shall see this , and be glad : and your heart shall live that seek god .
this also shall please the lord better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs .
i will praise the name of god with a song , and will magnify him with thanksgiving .
through mighty signs and wonders , by the power of the spirit of god ; so that from jerusalem , and round about unto illyricum , i have fully preached the gospel of christ .
nevertheless , brethren , i have written the more boldly unto you in some sort , as putting you in mind , because of the grace that is given to me of god ,
that i should be the minister of jesus christ to the gentiles , ministering the gospel of god , that the offering up of the gentiles might be acceptable , being sanctified by the holy ghost .
i have therefore whereof i may glory through jesus christ in those things which pertain to god .
for i will not dare to speak of any of those things which christ hath not wrought by me , to make the gentiles obedient , by word and deed ,
and again , praise the lord , all ye gentiles ; and laud him , all ye people .
and again , esaias saith , there shall be a root of jesse , and he that shall rise to reign over the gentiles ; in him shall the gentiles trust .
now the god of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing , that ye may abound in hope , through the power of the holy ghost .
and i myself also am persuaded of you , my brethren , that ye also are full of goodness , filled with all knowledge , able also to admonish one another .
but as it is written , to whom he was not spoken of , they shall see : and they that have not heard shall understand .
yea , so have i strived to preach the gospel , not where christ was named , lest i should build upon another man ' s foundation :
the seed also of his servants shall inherit it : and they that love his name shall dwell therein .
let the heaven and earth praise him , the seas , and everything that moveth therein .
for god will save zion , and will build the cities of judah : that they may dwell there , and have it in possession .
and again he saith , rejoice , ye gentiles , with his people .
that every man should let his manservant , and every man his maidservant , being an hebrew or an hebrewess , go free ; that none should serve himself of them , to wit , of a jew his brother .
this is the word that came unto jeremiah from the lord , after that the king zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which were at jerusalem , to proclaim liberty unto them ;
when the king of babylon ' s army fought against jerusalem , and against all the cities of judah that were left , against lachish , and against azekah : for these defenced cities remained of the cities of judah .
then jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto zedekiah king of judah in jerusalem ,
but thou shalt die in peace : and with the burnings of thy fathers , the former kings which were before thee , so shall they burn odours for thee ; and they will lament thee , saying , ah lord ! for i have pronounced the word , saith the lord .
yet hear the word of the lord , o zedekiah king of judah ; thus saith the lord of thee , thou shalt not die by the sword :
thus saith the lord , the god of israel ; go and speak to zedekiah king of judah , and tell him , thus saith the lord ; behold , i will give this city into the hand of the king of babylon , and he shall burn it with fire :
the word which came unto jeremiah from the lord , when nebuchadnezzar king of babylon , and all his army , and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion , and all the people , fought against jerusalem , and against all the cities thereof , saying ,
when i wept , and chastened my soul with fasting , that was to my reproach .
i made sackcloth also my garment ; and i became a proverb to them .
let not the waterflood overflow me , neither let the deep swallow me up , and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me .
but as for me , my prayer is unto thee , o lord , in an acceptable time : o god , in the multitude of thy mercy hear me , in the truth of thy salvation .
they that sit in the gate speak against me ; and i was the song of the drunkards .
thou hast known my reproach , and my shame , and my dishonour : mine adversaries are all before thee .
draw nigh unto my soul , and redeem it : deliver me because of mine enemies .
and hide not thy face from thy servant ; for i am in trouble : hear me speedily .
hear me , o lord ; for thy lovingkindness is good : turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies .
reproach hath broken my heart ; and i am full of heaviness : and i looked for some to take pity , but there was none ; and for comforters , but i found none .
they gave me also gall for my meat ; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink .
let their table become a snare before them : and that which should have been for their welfare , let it become a trap .
let their eyes be darkened , that they see not ; and make their loins continually to shake .
let their habitation be desolate ; and let none dwell in their tents .
let them be blotted out of the book of the living , and not be written with the righteous .
add iniquity unto their iniquity : and let them not come into thy righteousness .
but i am poor and sorrowful : let thy salvation , o god , set me up on high .
and they put away the strange gods from among them , and served the lord : and his soul was grieved for the misery of israel .
moreover the porters , akkub , talmon , and their brethren that kept the gates , were an hundred seventy and two .
and of thy sons that shall issue from thee , which thou shalt beget , shall they take away ; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of babylon .
and the children of israel said unto the lord , we have sinned : do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee ; deliver us only , we pray thee , this day .
all the levites in the holy city were two hundred fourscore and four .
then said hezekiah to isaiah , good is the word of the lord which thou hast spoken . he said moreover , for there shall be peace and truth in my days .
go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen ; let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation .
then said isaiah to hezekiah , hear the word of the lord of hosts :
yet ye have forsaken me , and served other gods : wherefore i will deliver you no more .
behold , the days come , that all that is in thine house , and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day , shall be carried to babylon : nothing shall be left , saith the lord .
the zidonians also , and the amalekites , and the maonites , did oppress you ; and ye cried to me , and i delivered you out of their hand .
also of the levites : shemaiah the son of hashub , the son of azrikam , the son of hashabiah , the son of bunni ;
then david arose , and all the people that were with him , and they passed over jordan : by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over jordan .
and the lord said unto the children of israel , did not i deliver you from the egyptians , and from the amorites , from the children of ammon , and from the philistines ?
and their brethren , mighty men of valour , an hundred twenty and eight : and their overseer was zabdiel , the son of one of the great men .
and it came to pass , after they were departed , that they came up out of the well , and went and told king david , and said unto david , arise , and pass quickly over the water : for thus hath ahithophel counselled against you .
and the children of israel cried unto the lord , saying , we have sinned against thee , both because we have forsaken our god , and also served baalim .
and mattaniah the son of micha , the son of zabdi , the son of asaph , was the principal to begin the thanksgiving in prayer : and bakbukiah the second among his brethren , and abda the son of shammua , the son of galal , the son of jeduthun .
and when absalom ' s servants came to the woman to the house , they said , where is ahimaaz and jonathan ? and the woman said unto them , they be gone over the brook of water . and when they had sought and could not find them , they returned to jerusalem .
and shabbethai and jozabad , of the chief of the levites , had the oversight of the outward business of the house of god .
and aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of egypt ; and the frogs came up , and covered the land of egypt .
of the priests : jedaiah the son of joiarib , jachin .
and the frogs shall come up both on thee , and upon thy people , and upon all thy servants .
and his brethren , chief of the fathers , two hundred forty and two : and amashai the son of azareel , the son of ahasai , the son of meshillemoth , the son of immer ,
and the lord spake unto moses , say unto aaron , stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams , over the rivers , and over the ponds , and cause frogs to come up upon the land of egypt .
and their brethren that did the work of the house were eight hundred twenty and two : and adaiah the son of jeroham , the son of pelaliah , the son of amzi , the son of zechariah , the son of pashur , the son of malchiah ,
and the people and princes of gilead said one to another , what man is he that will begin to fight against the children of ammon ? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of gilead .
then pharaoh called for moses and aaron , and said , intreat the lord , that he may take away the frogs from me , and from my people ; and i will let the people go , that they may do sacrifice unto the lord .
then the children of ammon were gathered together , and encamped in gilead . and the children of israel assembled themselves together , and encamped in mizpeh .
and moses said unto pharaoh , glory over me : when shall i intreat for thee , and for thy servants , and for thy people , to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses , that they may remain in the river only ?
so israel and absalom pitched in the land of gilead .
and it came to pass , when david was come to mahanaim , that shobi the son of nahash of rabbah of the children of ammon , and machir the son of ammiel of lo - debar , and barzillai the gileadite of rogelim ,
then david came to mahanaim . and absalom passed over jordan , he and all the men of israel with him .
and absalom made amasa captain of the host instead of joab : which amasa was a man ' s son , whose name was ithra an israelite , that went in to abigail the daughter of nahash , sister to zeruiah joab ' s mother .
then said he , what have they seen in thine house ? and hezekiah answered , all that is in mine house have they seen : there is nothing among my treasures that i have not shewed them .
then came isaiah the prophet unto king hezekiah , and said unto him , what said these men ? and from whence came they unto thee ? and hezekiah said , they are come from a far country unto me , even from babylon .
brought beds , and basons , and earthen vessels , and wheat , and barley , and flour , and parched corn , and beans , and lentiles , and parched pulse ,
and honey , and butter , and sheep , and cheese of kine , for david , and for the people that were with him , to eat : for they said , the people is hungry , and weary , and thirsty , in the wilderness .
at that time merodach - baladan , the son of baladan , king of babylon , sent letters and a present to hezekiah : for he had heard that he had been sick , and was recovered .
and of the shilonites ; asaiah the firstborn , and his sons .
and of the sons of zerah ; jeuel , and their brethren , six hundred and ninety .
and of the sons of benjamin ; sallu the son of meshullam , the son of hodaviah , the son of hasenuah ,
and ibneiah the son of jeroham , and elah the son of uzzi , the son of michri , and meshullam the son of shephathiah , the son of reuel , the son of ibnijah ;
so all israel were reckoned by genealogies ; and , behold , they were written in the book of the kings of israel and judah , who were carried away to babylon for their transgression .
and he straitly charged him , and forthwith sent him away ;
now the first inhabitants that dwelt in their possessions in their cities were , the israelites , the priests , levites , and the nethinims .
and saith unto him , see thou say nothing to any man : but go thy way , shew thyself to the priest , and offer for thy cleansing those things which moses commanded , for a testimony unto them .
and in jerusalem dwelt of the children of judah , and of the children of benjamin , and of the children of ephraim , and manasseh ;
but he went out , and began to publish it much , and to blaze abroad the matter , insomuch that jesus could no more openly enter into the city , but was without in desert places : and they came to him from every quarter .
uthai the son of ammihud , the son of omri , the son of imri , the son of bani , of the children of pharez the son of judah .
and it came to pass , as he drew back his hand , that , behold , his brother came out : and she said , how hast thou broken forth ? this breach be upon thee : therefore his name was called pharez .
and there came a leper to him , beseeching him , and kneeling down to him , and saying unto him , if thou wilt , thou canst make me clean .
and it came to pass in the time of her travail , that , behold , twins were in her womb .
and jesus , moved with compassion , put forth his hand , and touched him , and saith unto him , i will ; be thou clean .
and as soon as he had spoken , immediately the leprosy departed from him , and he was cleansed .
when she was brought forth , she sent to her father in law , saying , by the man , whose these are , am i with child : and she said , discern , i pray thee , whose are these , the signet , and bracelets , and staff .
and judah acknowledged them , and said , she hath been more righteous than i ; because that i gave her not to shelah my son . and he knew her again no more .
and judah said , let her take it to her , lest we be shamed : behold , i sent this kid , and thou hast not found her .
and it came to pass about three months after , that it was told judah , saying , tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot ; and also , behold , she is with child by whoredom . and judah said , bring her forth , and let her be burnt .
and afterward came out his brother , that had the scarlet thread upon his hand : and his name was called zarah .
and it was told the gazites , saying , samson is come hither . and they compassed him in , and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city , and were quiet all the night , saying , in the morning , when it is day , we shall kill him .
he made a pit , and digged it , and is fallen into the ditch which he made .
and samson lay till midnight , and arose at midnight , and took the doors of the gate of the city , and the two posts , and went away with them , bar and all , and put them upon his shoulders , and carried them up to the top of an hill that is before hebron .
behold , he travaileth with iniquity , and hath conceived mischief , and brought forth falsehood .
he hath also prepared for him the instruments of death ; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors .
then went samson to gaza , and saw there an harlot , and went in unto her .
if he turn not , he will whet his sword ; he hath bent his bow , and made it ready .
god judgeth the righteous , and god is angry with the wicked every day .
my defence is of god , which saveth the upright in heart .
for though ye had smitten the whole army of the chaldeans that fight against you , and there remained but wounded men among them , yet should they rise up every man in his tent , and burn this city with fire .
and it came to pass , that when the army of the chaldeans was broken up from jerusalem for fear of pharaoh ' s army ,
and he turned unto her by the way , and said , go to , i pray thee , let me come in unto thee ; ( for he knew not that she was his daughter in law . ) and she said , what wilt thou give me , that thou mayest come in unto me ?
then jeremiah went forth out of jerusalem to go into the land of benjamin , to separate himself thence in the midst of the people .
and he said , i will send thee a kid from the flock . and she said , wilt thou give me a pledge , till thou send it ?
and when he was in the gate of benjamin , a captain of the ward was there , whose name was irijah , the son of shelemiah , the son of hananiah ; and he took jeremiah the prophet , saying , thou fallest away to the chaldeans .
then the lords of the philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried , and she bound him with them .
and he said , what pledge shall i give thee ? and she said , thy signet , and thy bracelets , and thy staff that is in thine hand . and he gave it her , and came in unto her , and she conceived by him .
then said jeremiah , it is false ; i fall not away to the chaldeans . but he hearkened not to him : so irijah took jeremiah , and brought him to the princes .
now there were men lying in wait , abiding with her in the chamber . and she said unto him , the philistines be upon thee , samson . and he brake the withs , as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire . so his strength was not known .
and she arose , and went away , and laid by her vail from her , and put on the garments of her widowhood .
wherefore the princes were wroth with jeremiah , and smote him , and put him in prison in the house of jonathan the scribe : for they had made that the prison .
and delilah said to samson , tell me , i pray thee , wherein thy great strength lieth , and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee .
and in process of time the daughter of shuah judah ' s wife died ; and judah was comforted , and went up unto his sheepshearers to timnath , he and his friend hirah the adullamite .
if thou hast any thing to say , answer me : speak , for i desire to justify thee .
when jeremiah was entered into the dungeon , and into the cabins , and jeremiah had remained there many days ;
and it was told tamar , saying , behold thy father in law goeth up to timnath to shear his sheep .
then zedekiah the king sent , and took him out : and the king asked him secretly in his house , and said , is there any word from the lord ? and jeremiah said , there is : for , said he , thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of babylon .
and it came to pass afterward , that he loved a woman in the valley of sorek , whose name was delilah .
and she put her widow ' s garments off from her , and covered her with a vail , and wrapped herself , and sat in an open place , which is by the way to timnath ; for she saw that shelah was grown , and she was not given unto him to wife .
i will praise the lord according to his righteousness : and will sing praise to the name of the lord most high .
moreover jeremiah said unto king zedekiah , what have i offended against thee , or against thy servants , or against this people , that ye have put me in prison ?
when judah saw her , he thought her to be an harlot ; because she had covered her face .
his mischief shall return upon his own head , and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate .
where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you , saying , the king of babylon shall not come against you , nor against this land ?
and judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the adullamite , to receive his pledge from the woman ' s hand : but he found her not .
babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed : howl for her ; take balm for her pain , if so she may be healed .
babylon hath been a golden cup in the lord ' s hand , that made all the earth drunken : the nations have drunken of her wine ; therefore the nations are mad .
and he returned to judah , and said , i cannot find her ; and also the men of the place said , that there was no harlot in this place .
mark well , o job , hearken unto me : hold thy peace , and i will speak .
then he asked the men of that place , saying , where is the harlot , that was openly by the way side ? and they said , there was no harlot in this place .
to bring back his soul from the pit , to be enlightened with the light of the living .
we would have healed babylon , but she is not healed : forsake her , and let us go every one into his own country : for her judgment reacheth unto heaven , and is lifted up even to the skies .
and will send unto babylon fanners , that shall fan her , and shall empty her land : for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about .
thus saith the lord ; behold , i will raise up against babylon , and against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against me , a destroying wind ;
thus the slain shall fall in the land of the chaldeans , and they that are thrust through in her streets .
against him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow , and against him that lifteth himself up in his brigandine : and spare ye not her young men ; destroy ye utterly all her host .
flee out of the midst of babylon , and deliver every man his soul : be not cut off in her iniquity ; for this is the time of the lord ' s vengeance ; he will render unto her a recompence .
and their brethren , according to their generations , nine hundred and fifty and six . all these men were chief of the fathers in the house of their fathers .
for israel hath not been forsaken , nor judah of his god , of the lord of hosts ; though their land was filled with sin against the holy one of israel .
then there was a famine in the days of david three years , year after year ; and david inquired of the lord . and the lord answered , it is for saul , and for his bloody house , because he slew the gibeonites .
they shall perish , but thou shalt endure : yea , all of them shall wax old like a garment ; as a vesture shalt thou change them , and they shall be changed :
then zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit jeremiah into the court of the prison , and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers ' street , until all the bread in the city were spent . thus jeremiah remained in the court of the prison .
and the king called the gibeonites , and said unto them ; ( now the gibeonites were not of the children of israel , but of the remnant of the amorites ; and the children of israel had sworn unto them : and saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of israel and judah . )
wherefore david said unto the gibeonites , what shall i do for you ? and wherewith shall i make the atonement , that ye may bless the inheritance of the lord ?
i said , o my god , take me not away in the midst of my days : thy years are throughout all generations .
and the gibeonites said unto him , we will have no silver nor gold of saul , nor of his house ; neither for us shalt thou kill any man in israel . and he said , what ye shall say , that will i do for you .
he weakened my strength in the way ; he shortened my days .
therefore hear now , i pray thee , o my lord the king : let my supplication , i pray thee , be accepted before thee ; that thou cause me not to return to the house of jonathan the scribe , lest i die there .
the children of thy servants shall continue , and their seed shall be established before thee .
but thou art the same , and thy years shall have no end .
when the people are gathered together , and the kingdoms , to serve the lord .
to declare the name of the lord in zion , and his praise in jerusalem ;
to hear the groaning of the prisoner ; to loose those that are appointed to death ;
thou shalt arise , and have mercy upon zion : for the time to favour her , yea , the set time , is come .
but thou , o lord , shalt endure for ever ; and thy remembrance unto all generations .
for thy servants take pleasure in her stones , and favour the dust thereof .
he will regard the prayer of the destitute , and not despise their prayer .
when the lord shall build up zion , he shall appear in his glory .
for he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary ; from heaven did the lord behold the earth ;
this shall be written for the generation to come : and the people which shall be created shall praise the lord .
my days are like a shadow that declineth ; and i am withered like grass .
because of thine indignation and thy wrath : for thou hast lifted me up , and cast me down .
but martha was cumbered about much serving , and came to him , and said , lord , dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone ? bid her therefore that she help me .
but saul had given michal his daughter , david ' s wife , to phalti the son of laish , which was of gallim .
but one thing is needful : and mary hath chosen that good part , which shall not be taken away from her .
and jesus answered and said unto her , martha , martha , thou art careful and troubled about many things :
and she arose , and bowed herself on her face to the earth , and said , behold , let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord .
and when the servants of david were come to abigail to carmel , they spake unto her , saying , david sent us unto thee to take thee to him to wife .
david also took ahinoam of jezreel ; and they were also both of them his wives .
and abigail hasted , and arose , and rode upon an ass , with five damsels of hers that went after her ; and she went after the messengers of david , and became his wife .
and they set them up images and groves in every high hill , and under every green tree :
for they served idols , whereof the lord had said unto them , ye shall not do this thing .
and there they burnt incense in all the high places , as did the heathen whom the lord carried away before them ; and wrought wicked things to provoke the lord to anger :
but the king spared mephibosheth , the son of jonathan the son of saul , because of the lord ' s oath that was between them , between david and jonathan the son of saul .
but the king took the two sons of rizpah the daughter of aiah , whom she bare unto saul , armoni and mephibosheth ; and the five sons of michal the daughter of saul , whom she brought up for adriel the son of barzillai the meholathite :
and they answered the king , the man that consumed us , and that devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of israel ,
let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us , and we will hang them up unto the lord in gibeah of saul , whom the lord did choose . and the king said , i will give them .
and he delivered them into the hands of the gibeonites , and they hanged them in the hill before the lord : and they fell all seven together , and were put to death in the days of harvest , in the first days , in the beginning of barley harvest .
then he is gracious unto him , and saith , deliver him from going down to the pit : i have found a ransom .
yea , his soul draweth near unto the grave , and his life to the destroyers .
his flesh is consumed away , that it cannot be seen ; and his bones that were not seen stick out .
he will deliver his soul from going into the pit , and his life shall see the light .
he looketh upon men , and if any say , i have sinned , and perverted that which was right , and it profited me not ;
he shall pray unto god , and he will be favourable unto him : and he shall see his face with joy : for he will render unto man his righteousness .
his flesh shall be fresher than a child ' s : he shall return to the days of his youth :
lo , all these things worketh god oftentimes with man ,
there was also a lot for the tribe of manasseh ; for he was the firstborn of joseph ; to wit , for machir the firstborn of manasseh , the father of gilead : because he was a man of war , therefore he had gilead and bashan .
but zelophehad , the son of hepher , the son of gilead , the son of machir , the son of manasseh , had no sons , but daughters : and these are the names of his daughters , mahlah , and noah , hoglah , milcah , and tirzah .
and they came near before eleazar the priest , and before joshua the son of nun , and before the princes , saying , the lord commanded moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren . therefore according to the commandment of the lord he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father .
and there fell ten portions to manasseh , beside the land of gilead and bashan , which were on the other side jordan ;
because the daughters of manasseh had an inheritance among his sons : and the rest of manasseh ' s sons had the land of gilead .
and the coast of manasseh was from asher to michmethah , that lieth before shechem ; and the border went along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of en - tappuah .
now manasseh had the land of tappuah : but tappuah on the border of manasseh belonged to the children of ephraim ;
and the thing which he did displeased the lord : wherefore he slew him also .
and the coast descended unto the river kanah , southward of the river : these cities of ephraim are among the cities of manasseh : the coast of manasseh also was on the north side of the river , and the outgoings of it were at the sea :
then said judah to tamar his daughter in law , remain a widow at thy father ' s house , till shelah my son be grown : for he said , lest peradventure he die also , as his brethren did . and tamar went and dwelt in her father ' s house .
so that his life abhorreth bread , and his soul dainty meat .
he putteth my feet in the stocks , he marketh all my paths .
yet it pleased the lord to bruise him ; he hath put him to grief : when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin , he shall see his seed , he shall prolong his days , and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hand .
behold , he findeth occasions against me , he counteth me for his enemy ,
he shall see of the travail of his soul , and shall be satisfied : by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many ; for he shall bear their iniquities .
why dost thou strive against him ? for he giveth not account of any of his matters .
therefore will i divide him a portion with the great , and he shall divide the spoil with the strong ; because he hath poured out his soul unto death : and he was numbered with the transgressors ; and he bare the sin of many , and made intercession for the transgressors .
behold , in this thou art not just : i will answer thee , that god is greater than man .
in a dream , in a vision of the night , when deep sleep falleth upon men , in slumberings upon the bed ;
for god speaketh once , yea twice , yet man perceiveth it not .
that he may withdraw man from his purpose , and hide pride from man .
then he openeth the ears of men , and sealeth their instruction ,
he keepeth back his soul from the pit , and his life from perishing by the sword .
but esaias is very bold , and saith , i was found of them that sought me not ; i was made manifest unto them that asked not after me .
but to israel he saith , all day long i have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people .
and moses said before the lord , behold , i am of uncircumcised lips , and how shall pharaoh hearken unto me ?
and how shall they preach , except they be sent ? as it is written , how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace , and bring glad tidings of good things !
how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed ? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard ? and how shall they hear without a preacher ?
so then faith cometh by hearing , and hearing by the word of god .
but they have not all obeyed the gospel . for esaias saith , lord , who hath believed our report ?
and in that day there shall be a root of jesse , which shall stand for an ensign of the people ; to it shall the gentiles seek : and his rest shall be glorious .
but i say , did not israel know ? first moses saith , i will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people , and by a foolish nation i will anger you .
the envy also of ephraim shall depart , and the adversaries of judah shall be cut off : ephraim shall not envy judah , and judah shall not vex ephraim .
but i say , have they not heard ? yes verily , their sound went into all the earth , and their words unto the ends of the world .
and he shall set up an ensign for the nations , and shall assemble the outcasts of israel , and gather together the dispersed of judah from the four corners of the earth .
and the lord shall utterly destroy the tongue of the egyptian sea ; and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the river , and shall smite it in the seven streams , and make men go over dryshod .
but they shall fly upon the shoulders of the philistines toward the west ; they shall spoil them of the east together : they shall lay their hand upon edom and moab ; and the children of ammon shall obey them .
and the lord said , behold , the people is one , and they have all one language ; and this they begin to do : and now nothing will be restrained from them , which they have imagined to do .
go to , let us go down , and there confound their language , that they may not understand one another ' s speech .
and they said , go to , let us build us a city and a tower , whose top may reach unto heaven ; and let us make us a name , lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth .
and nabal answered david ' s servants , and said , who is david ? and who is the son of jesse ? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master .
and the lord came down to see the city and the tower , which the children of men builded .
for the scripture saith , whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed .
for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness ; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation .
for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved .
so the lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth : and they left off to build the city .
therefore is the name of it called babel ; because the lord did there confound the language of all the earth : and from thence did the lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth .
they were a wall unto us both by night and day , all the while we were with them keeping the sheep .
but the men were very good unto us , and we were not hurt , neither missed we any thing , as long as we were conversant with them , when we were in the fields :
then abigail made haste , and took two hundred loaves , and two bottles of wine , and five sheep ready dressed , and five measures of parched corn , and an hundred clusters of raisins , and two hundred cakes of figs , and laid them on asses .
now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do ; for evil is determined against our master , and against all his household : for he is such a son of belial , that a man cannot speak to him .
but into whatsoever city ye enter , and they receive you not , go your ways out into the streets of the same , and say ,
so david ' s young men turned their way , and went again , and came and told him all those sayings .
and they said one to another , go to , let us make brick , and burn them throughly . and they had brick for stone , and slime had they for morter .
even the very dust of your city , which cleaveth on us , we do wipe off against you : notwithstanding be ye sure of this , that the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you .
shall i then take my bread , and my water , and my flesh that i have killed for my shearers , and give it unto men , whom i know not whence they be ?
and it came to pass , as they journeyed from the east , that they found a plain in the land of shinar ; and they dwelt there .
but one of the young men told abigail , nabal ' s wife , saying , behold , david sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master ; and he railed on them .
and the whole earth was of one language , and of one speech .
then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity , and this woman shall bear her iniquity .
and david said unto his men , gird ye on every man his sword . and they girded on every man his sword ; and david also girded on his sword : and there went up after david about four hundred men ; and two hundred abode by the stuff .
or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him , and he be jealous over his wife , and shall set the woman before the lord , and the priest shall execute upon her all this law .
but it shall be more tolerable for tyre and sidon at the judgment , than for you .
and there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people , which shall be left , from assyria ; like as it was to israel in the day that he came up out of the land of egypt .
and thou , capernaum , which art exalted to heaven , shalt be thrust down to hell .
but i say unto you , that it shall be more tolerable in that day for sodom , than for that city .
woe unto thee , chorazin ! woe unto thee , bethsaida ! for if the mighty works had been done in tyre and sidon , which have been done in you , they had a great while ago repented , sitting in sackcloth and ashes .
and he said unto them , i beheld satan as lightning fall from heaven .
behold , i give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions , and over all the power of the enemy : and nothing shall by any means hurt you .
and she said unto her servants , go on before me ; behold , i come after you . but she told not her husband nabal .
he that heareth you heareth me ; and he that despiseth you despiseth me ; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me .
and the seventy returned again with joy , saying , lord , even the devils are subject unto us through thy name .
and if the woman be not defiled , but be clean ; then she shall be free , and shall conceive seed .
then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman ' s hand , and shall wave the offering before the lord , and offer it upon the altar :
and the priest shall take an handful of the offering , even the memorial thereof , and burn it upon the altar , and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water .
now david had said , surely in vain have i kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness , so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him : and he hath requited me evil for good .
this is the law of jealousies , when a wife goeth aside to another instead of her husband , and is defiled ;
and the sons of simeon ; jemuel , and jamin , and ohad , and jachin , and zohar , and shaul the son of a canaanitish woman : these are the families of simeon .
notwithstanding in this rejoice not , that the spirits are subject unto you ; but rather rejoice , because your names are written in heaven .
and fell at his feet , and said , upon me , my lord , upon me let this iniquity be : and let thine handmaid , i pray thee , speak in thine audience , and hear the words of thine handmaid .
and these are the names of the sons of levi according to their generations ; gershon , and kohath , and merari : and the years of the life of levi were an hundred thirty and seven years .
in that hour jesus rejoiced in spirit , and said , i thank thee , o father , lord of heaven and earth , that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent , and hast revealed them unto babes : even so , father ; for so it seemed good in thy sight .
and when abigail saw david , she hasted , and lighted off the ass , and fell before david on her face , and bowed herself to the ground ,
and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron , and gave them a charge unto the children of israel , and unto pharaoh king of egypt , to bring the children of israel out of the land of egypt .
all things are delivered to me of my father : and no man knoweth who the son is , but the father ; and who the father is , but the son , and he to whom the son will reveal him .
so and more also do god unto the enemies of david , if i leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall .
these be the heads of their fathers ' houses : the sons of reuben the firstborn of israel ; hanoch , and pallu , hezron , and carmi : these be the families of reuben .
yet a man is risen to pursue thee , and to seek thy soul : but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the lord thy god ; and the souls of thine enemies , them shall he sling out , as out of the middle of a sling .
and the sons of merari ; mahali and mushi : these are the families of levi according to their generations .
and he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse : and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her , and become bitter .
i pray thee , forgive the trespass of thine handmaid : for the lord will certainly make my lord a sure house ; because my lord fighteth the battles of the lord , and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days .
and the priest shall write these curses in a book , and he shall blot them out with the bitter water :
and now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord , let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord .
and this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels , to make thy belly to swell , and thy thigh to rot : and the woman shall say , amen , amen .
now therefore , my lord , as the lord liveth , and as thy soul liveth , seeing the lord hath withholden thee from coming to shed blood , and from avenging thyself with thine own hand , now let thine enemies , and they that seek evil to my lord , be as nabal .
then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing , and the priest shall say unto the woman , the lord make thee a curse and an oath among thy people , when the lord doth make thy thigh to rot , and thy belly to swell ;
and he answering said , thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy strength , and with all thy mind ; and thy neighbour as thyself .
and he said unto him , thou hast answered right : this do , and thou shalt live .
but he , willing to justify himself , said unto jesus , and who is my neighbour ?
and he turned him unto his disciples , and said privately , blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see :
go in , speak unto pharaoh king of egypt , that he let the children of israel go out of his land .
for i tell you , that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see , and have not seen them ; and to hear those things which ye hear , and have not heard them .
and moses spake before the lord , saying , behold , the children of israel have not hearkened unto me ; how then shall pharaoh hear me , who am of uncircumcised lips ?
and , behold , a certain lawyer stood up , and tempted him , saying , master , what shall i do to inherit eternal life ?
he said unto him , what is written in the law ? how readest thou ?
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
and the spirit of jealousy come upon him , and he be jealous of his wife , and she be defiled : or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him , and he be jealous of his wife , and she be not defiled :
and the priest shall bring her near , and set her before the lord :
and the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel ; and of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take , and put it into the water :
and the priest shall set the woman before the lord , and uncover the woman ' s head , and put the offering of memorial in her hands , which is the jealousy offering : and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse :
and it shall come to pass , when the lord shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee , and shall have appointed thee ruler over israel ;
and the priest shall charge her by an oath , and say unto the woman , if no man have lain with thee , and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness with another instead of thy husband , be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse :
that this shall be no grief unto thee , nor offence of heart unto my lord , either that thou hast shed blood causeless , or that my lord hath avenged himself : but when the lord shall have dealt well with my lord , then remember thine handmaid .
and david said to abigail , blessed be the lord god of israel , which sent thee this day to meet me :
and likewise a levite , when he was at the place , came and looked on him , and passed by on the other side .
for in very deed , as the lord god of israel liveth , which hath kept me back from hurting thee , except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me , surely there had not been left unto nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall .
and the sons of korah ; assir , and elkanah , and abiasaph : these are the families of the korhites .
but a certain samaritan , as he journeyed , came where he was : and when he saw him , he had compassion on him ,
and blessed be thy advice , and blessed be thou , which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood , and from avenging myself with mine own hand .
and eleazar aaron ' s son took him one of the daughters of putiel to wife ; and she bare him phinehas : these are the heads of the fathers of the levites according to their families .
and jesus answering said , a certain man went down from jerusalem to jericho , and fell among thieves , which stripped him of his raiment , and wounded him , and departed , leaving him half dead .
and abigail came to nabal ; and , behold , he held a feast in his house , like the feast of a king ; and nabal ' s heart was merry within him , for he was very drunken : wherefore she told him nothing , less or more , until the morning light .
these are that aaron and moses , to whom the lord said , bring out the children of israel from the land of egypt according to their armies .
and by chance there came down a certain priest that way : and when he saw him , he passed by on the other side .
so david received of her hand that which she had brought him , and said unto her , go up in peace to thine house ; see , i have hearkened to thy voice , and have accepted thy person .
these are they which spake to pharaoh king of egypt , to bring out the children of israel from egypt : these are that moses and aaron .
and it came to pass about ten days after , that the lord smote nabal , that he died .
and it came to pass on the day when the lord spake unto moses in the land of egypt ,
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
but it came to pass in the morning , when the wine was gone out of nabal , and his wife had told him these things , that his heart died within him , and he became as a stone .
that the lord spake unto moses , saying , i am the lord : speak thou unto pharaoh king of egypt all that i say unto thee .
and every man ' s hallowed things shall be his : whatsoever any man giveth the priest , it shall be his .
and a man lie with her carnally , and it be hid from the eyes of her husband , and be kept close , and she be defiled , and there be no witness against her , neither she be taken with the manner ;
speak unto the children of israel , and say unto them , if any man ' s wife go aside , and commit a trespass against him ,
now it came to pass , as they went , that he entered into a certain village : and a certain woman named martha received him into her house .
and she had a sister called mary , which also sat at jesus ' feet , and heard his word .
which now of these three , thinkest thou , was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves ?
and amram took him jochebed his father ' s sister to wife ; and she bare him aaron and moses : and the years of the life of amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years .
and he said , he that shewed mercy on him . then said jesus unto him , go , and do thou likewise .
and the sons of izhar ; korah , and nepheg , and zichri .
and went to him , and bound up his wounds , pouring in oil and wine , and set him on his own beast , and brought him to an inn , and took care of him .
and the sons of uzziel ; mishael , and elzaphan , and zithri .
and on the morrow when he departed , he took out two pence , and gave them to the host , and said unto him , take care of him ; and whatsoever thou spendest more , when i come again , i will repay thee .
and aaron took him elisheba , daughter of amminadab , sister of naashon , to wife ; and she bare him nadab , and abihu , eleazar , and ithamar .
who hath believed our report ? and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed ?
for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant , and as a root out of a dry ground : he hath no form nor comeliness ; and when we shall see him , there is no beauty that we should desire him .
he is despised and rejected of men ; a man of sorrows , and acquainted with grief : and we hid as it were our faces from him ; he was despised , and we esteemed him not .
he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty .
surely he hath borne our griefs , and carried our sorrows : yet we did esteem him stricken , smitten of god , and afflicted .
nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness ; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday .
and he made his grave with the wicked , and with the rich in his death ; because he had done no violence , neither was any deceit in his mouth .
a thousand shall fall at thy side , and ten thousand at thy right hand ; but it shall not come nigh thee .
only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked .
because thou hast made the lord , which is my refuge , even the most high , thy habitation ;
i will say of the lord , he is my refuge and my fortress : my god ; in him will i trust .
but he was wounded for our transgressions , he was bruised for our iniquities : the chastisement of our peace was upon him ; and with his stripes we are healed .
surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler , and from the noisome pestilence .
all we like sheep have gone astray ; we have turned every one to his own way ; and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all .
he shall cover thee with his feathers , and under his wings shalt thou trust : his truth shall be thy shield and buckler .
he was oppressed , and he was afflicted , yet he opened not his mouth : he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter , and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb , so he openeth not his mouth .
thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night ; nor for the arrow that flieth by day ;
he was taken from prison and from judgment : and who shall declare his generation ? for he was cut off out of the land of the living : for the transgression of my people was he stricken .
and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne .
and i beheld , and , lo , in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts , and in the midst of the elders , stood a lamb as it had been slain , having seven horns and seven eyes , which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth .
and one of the elders saith unto me , weep not : behold , the lion of the tribe of juda , the root of david , hath prevailed to open the book , and to loose the seven seals thereof .
and i wept much , because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book , neither to look thereon .
and no man in heaven , nor in earth , neither under the earth , was able to open the book , neither to look thereon .
and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice , who is worthy to open the book , and to loose the seals thereof ?
and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside , sealed with seven seals .
and they sung a new song , saying , thou art worthy to take the book , and to open the seals thereof : for thou wast slain , and hast redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred , and tongue , and people , and nation ;
and when he had taken the book , the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb , having every one of them harps , and golden vials full of odours , which are the prayers of saints .
save caleb the son of jephunneh ; he shall see it , and to him will i give the land that he hath trodden upon , and to his children , because he hath wholly followed the lord .
also the lord was angry with me for your sakes , saying , thou also shalt not go in thither .
and the lord heard the voice of your words , and was wroth , and sware , saying ,
surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land , which i sware to give unto your fathers ,
yet in this thing ye did not believe the lord your god ,
who went in the way before you , to search you out a place to pitch your tents in , in fire by night , to shew you by what way ye should go , and in a cloud by day .
the lord your god which goeth before you , he shall fight for you , according to all that he did for you in egypt before your eyes ;
and in the wilderness , where thou hast seen how that the lord thy god bare thee , as a man doth bear his son , in all the way that ye went , until ye came into this place .
who , when he was reviled , reviled not again ; when he suffered , he threatened not ; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously :
for ye were as sheep going astray ; but are now returned unto the shepherd and bishop of your souls .
who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree , that we , being dead to sins , should live unto righteousness : by whose stripes ye were healed .
but joshua the son of nun , which standeth before thee , he shall go in thither : encourage him : for he shall cause israel to inherit it .
moreover your little ones , which ye said should be a prey , and your children , which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil , they shall go in thither , and unto them will i give it , and they shall possess it .
for what glory is it , if , when ye be buffeted for your faults , ye shall take it patiently ? but if , when ye do well , and suffer for it , ye take it patiently , this is acceptable with god .
for even hereunto were ye called : because christ also suffered for us , leaving us an example , that ye should follow his steps :
but as for you , turn you , and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the red sea .
and ye returned and wept before the lord ; but the lord would not hearken to your voice , nor give ear unto you .
so ye abode in kadesh many days , according unto the days that ye abode there .
then ye answered and said unto me , we have sinned against the lord , we will go up and fight , according to all that the lord our god commanded us . and when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war , ye were ready to go up into the hill .
and the lord said unto me , say unto them , go not up , neither fight ; for i am not among you ; lest ye be smitten before your enemies .
so i spake unto you ; and ye would not hear , but rebelled against the commandment of the lord , and went presumptuously up into the hill .
and the amorites , which dwelt in that mountain , came out against you , and chased you , as bees do , and destroyed you in seir , even unto hormah .
then said he unto the disciples , it is impossible but that offences will come : but woe unto him , through whom they come !
it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and he cast into the sea , than that he should offend one of these little ones .
take heed to yourselves : if thy brother trespass against thee , rebuke him ; and if he repent , forgive him .
and if he trespass against thee seven times in a day , and seven times in a day turn again to thee , saying , i repent ; thou shalt forgive him .
and the apostles said unto the lord , increase our faith .
and the lord said , if ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed , ye might say unto this sycamine tree , be thou plucked up by the root , and be thou planted in the sea ; and it should obey you .
but which of you , having a servant plowing or feeding cattle , will say unto him by and by , when he is come from the field , go and sit down to meat ?
and will not rather say unto him , make ready wherewith i may sup , and gird thyself , and serve me , till i have eaten and drunken ; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink ?
doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him ? i trow not .
then died ibzan , and was buried at bethlehem .
but thou , lord , art most high for evermore .
when the wicked spring as the grass , and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish ; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever :
a brutish man knoweth not ; neither doth a fool understand this .
for this is as the waters of noah unto me : for as i have sworn that the waters of noah should no more go over the earth ; so have i sworn that i would not be wroth with thee , nor rebuke thee .
o lord , how great are thy works ! and thy thoughts are very deep .
in a little wrath i hid my face from thee for a moment ; but with everlasting kindness will i have mercy on thee , saith the lord thy redeemer .
for thou , lord , hast made me glad through thy work : i will triumph in the works of thy hands .
for a small moment have i forsaken thee ; but with great mercies will i gather thee .
upon an instrument of ten strings , and upon the psaltery ; upon the harp with a solemn sound .
for the lord hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit , and a wife of youth , when thou wast refused , saith thy god .
to shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning , and thy faithfulness every night ,
for thy maker is thine husband ; the lord of hosts is his name ; and thy redeemer the holy one of israel ; the god of the whole earth shall he be called .
it is a good thing to give thanks unto the lord , and to sing praises unto thy name , o most high :
fear not ; for thou shalt not be ashamed : neither be thou confounded ; for thou shalt not be put to shame : for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth , and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more .
for thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left ; and thy seed shall inherit the gentiles , and make the desolate cities to be inhabited .
enlarge the place of thy tent , and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations : spare not , lengthen thy cords , and strengthen thy stakes ;
sing , o barren , thou that didst not bear ; break forth into singing , and cry aloud , thou that didst not travail with child : for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife , saith the lord .
and after him elon , a zebulonite , judged israel ; and he judged israel ten years .
and elon the zebulonite died , and was buried in aijalon in the country of zebulun .
and after him abdon the son of hillel , a pirathonite , judged israel .
and he had forty sons and thirty nephews , that rode on threescore and ten ass colts : and he judged israel eight years .
and abdon the son of hillel the pirathonite died , and was buried in pirathon in the land of ephraim , in the mount of the amalekites .
and he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him , and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast , whose deadly wound was healed .
and he doeth great wonders , so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men ,
he that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity : he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword . here is the patience and the faith of the saints .
and he causeth all , both small and great , rich and poor , free and bond , to receive a mark in their right hand , or in their foreheads :
let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee ; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die ;
and that no man might buy or sell , save he that had the mark , or the name of the beast , or the number of his name .
and render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach , wherewith they have reproached thee , o lord .
and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast ; saying to them that dwell on the earth , that they should make an image to the beast , which had the wound by a sword , and did live .
so we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever : we will shew forth thy praise to all generations .
and he had power to give life unto the image of the beast , that the image of the beast should both speak , and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed .
here is wisdom . let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast : for it is the number of a man ; and his number is six hundred threescore and six .
wherefore should the heathen say , where is their god ? let him be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed .
and the lord said unto joshua , this day have i rolled away the reproach of egypt from off you . wherefore the name of the place is called gilgal unto this day .
now all the people that came out were circumcised : but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of egypt , them they had not circumcised .
and it came to pass , when they had done circumcising all the people , that they abode in their places in the camp , till they were whole .
and their children , whom he raised up in their stead , them joshua circumcised : for they were uncircumcised , because they had not circumcised them by the way .
the lord hath broken the staff of the wicked , and the sceptre of the rulers .
that thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of babylon , and say , how hath the oppressor ceased ! the golden city ceased !
the whole earth is at rest , and is quiet : they break forth into singing .
he who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke , he that ruled the nations in anger , is persecuted , and none hindereth .
for the lord will have mercy on jacob , and will yet choose israel , and set them in their own land : and the strangers shall be joined with them , and they shall cleave to the house of jacob .
and it shall come to pass in the day that the lord shall give thee rest from thy sorrow , and from thy fear , and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve ,
and the people shall take them , and bring them to their place : and the house of israel shall possess them in the land of the lord for servants and handmaids : and they shall take them captives , whose captives they were ; and they shall rule over their oppressors .
and the hand of the children of israel prospered , and prevailed against jabin the king of canaan , until they had destroyed jabin king of canaan .
so god subdued on that day jabin the king of canaan before the children of israel .
yea , the fir trees rejoice at thee , and the cedars of lebanon , saying , since thou art laid down , no feller is come up against us .
and joshua made him sharp knives , and circumcised the children of israel at the hill of the foreskins .
and this is the cause why joshua did circumcise : all the people that came out of egypt , that were males , even all the men of war , died in the wilderness by the way , after they came out of egypt .
again he said unto her , stand in the door of the tent , and it shall be , when any man doth come and inquire of thee , and say , is there any man here ? that thou shalt say , no .
and , behold , as barak pursued sisera , jael came out to meet him , and said unto him , come , and i will shew thee the man whom thou seekest . and when he came into her tent , behold , sisera lay dead , and the nail was in his temples .
then jael heber ' s wife took a nail of the tent , and took an hammer in her hand , and went softly unto him , and smote the nail into his temples , and fastened it into the ground : for he was fast asleep and weary . so he died .
now these are the generations of the sons of noah , shem , ham , and japheth : and unto them were sons born after the flood .
the sons of japheth ; gomer , and magog , and madai , and javan , and tubal , and meshech , and tiras .
and the sons of gomer ; ashkenaz , and riphath , and togarmah .
and the sons of javan ; elishah , and tarshish , kittim , and dodanim .
and he said unto her , give me , i pray thee , a little water to drink ; for i am thirsty . and she opened a bottle of milk , and gave him drink , and covered him .
and the sons of ham ; cush , and mizraim , and phut , and canaan .
and jael went out to meet sisera , and said unto him , turn in , my lord , turn in to me ; fear not . and when he had turned in unto her into the tent , she covered him with a mantle .
by these were the isles of the gentiles divided in their lands ; every one after his tongue , after their families , in their nations .
howbeit sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of jael the wife of heber the kenite : for there was peace between jabin the king of hazor and the house of heber the kenite .
but barak pursued after the chariots , and after the host , unto harosheth of the gentiles : and all the host of sisera fell upon the edge of the sword ; and there was not a man left .
and the sons of cush ; seba , and havilah , and sabtah , and raamah , and sabtecha : and the sons of raamah ; sheba , and dedan .
and the lord discomfited sisera , and all his chariots , and all his host , with the edge of the sword before barak ; so that sisera lighted down off his chariot , and fled away on his feet .
and deborah said unto barak , up ; for this is the day in which the lord hath delivered sisera into thine hand : is not the lord gone out before thee ? so barak went down from mount tabor , and ten thousand men after him .
he was a mighty hunter before the lord : wherefore it is said , even as nimrod the mighty hunter before the lord .
and sisera gathered together all his chariots , even nine hundred chariots of iron , and all the people that were with him , from harosheth of the gentiles unto the river of kishon .
and they shewed sisera that barak the son of abinoam was gone up to mount tabor .
now heber the kenite , which was of the children of hobab the father in law of moses , had severed himself from the kenites , and pitched his tent unto the plain of zaanaim , which is by kedesh .
and barak called zebulun and naphtali to kedesh ; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet : and deborah went up with him .
honour all men . love the brotherhood . fear god . honour the king .
the word of the lord came again unto me , saying ,
servants , be subject to your masters with all fear ; not only to the good and gentle , but also to the froward .
son of man , prophesy and say , thus saith the lord god ; howl ye , woe worth the day
for so is the will of god , that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men :
as free , and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness , but as the servants of god .
submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the lord ' s sake : whether it be to the king , as supreme ;
ethiopia , and libya , and lydia , and all the mingled people , and chub , and the men of the land that is in league , shall fall with them by the sword .
or unto governors , as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers , and for the praise of them that do well .
thus saith the lord ; they also that uphold egypt shall fall ; and the pride of her power shall come down : from the tower of syene shall they fall in it by the sword , saith the lord god .
for the day is near , even the day of the lord is near , a cloudy day ; it shall be the time of the heathen .
having your conversation honest among the gentiles : that , whereas they speak against you as evildoers , they may by your good works , which they shall behold , glorify god in the day of visitation .
and the sword shall come upon egypt , and great pain shall be in ethiopia , when the slain shall fall in egypt , and they shall take away her multitude , and her foundations shall be broken down .
for this is thankworthy , if a man for conscience toward god endure grief , suffering wrongfully .
which in time past were not a people , but are now the people of god : which had not obtained mercy , but now have obtained mercy .
in that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make the careless ethiopians afraid , and great pain shall come upon them , as in the day of egypt : for , lo , it cometh .
and they shall know that i am the lord , when i have set a fire in egypt , and when all her helpers shall be destroyed .
and they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate , and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted .
howbeit they did not hearken , but they did after their former manner .
so these nations feared the lord , and served their graven images , both their children , and their children ' s children : as did their fathers , so do they unto this day .
and they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of the lord , and ye shall know that the lord of hosts hath sent me unto you . and this shall come to pass , if ye will diligently obey the voice of the lord your god .
even he shall build the temple of the lord ; and he shall bear the glory , and shall sit and rule upon his throne ; and he shall be a priest upon his throne : and the counsel of peace shall be between them both .
and the crowns shall be to helem , and to tobijah , and to jedaiah , and to hen the son of zephaniah , for a memorial in the temple of the lord .
then take silver and gold , and make crowns , and set them upon the head of joshua the son of josedech , the high priest ;
and speak unto him , saying , thus speaketh the lord of hosts , saying , behold the man whose name is the branch ; and he shall grow up out of his place , and he shall build the temple of the lord :
take of them of the captivity , even of heldai , of tobijah , and of jedaiah , which are come from babylon , and come thou the same day , and go into the house of josiah the son of zephaniah ;
but the lord , who brought you up out of the land of egypt with great power and a stretched out arm , him shall ye fear , and him shall ye worship , and to him shall ye do sacrifice .
with whom the lord had made a covenant , and charged them saying , ye shall not fear other gods , nor bow yourselves to them , nor serve them , nor sacrifice to them :
and the covenant that i have made with you ye shall not forget ; neither shall ye fear other gods .
and the statutes , and the ordinances , and the law , and the commandment , which he wrote for you , ye shall observe to do for evermore ; and ye shall not fear other gods .
but the lord your god ye shall fear ; and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies .
and the lord rejected all the seed of israel , and afflicted them , and delivered them into the hand of spoilers , until he had cast them out of his sight .
for he rent israel from the house of david ; and they made jeroboam the son of nebat king : and jeroboam drave israel from following the lord , and made them sin a great sin .
for the children of israel walked in all the sins of jeroboam which he did ; they departed not from them ;
until the lord removed israel out of his sight , as he had said by all his servants the prophets . so was israel carried away out of their own land to assyria unto this day .
thus saith the lord god ; art thou he of whom i have spoken in old time by my servants the prophets of israel , which prophesied in those days many years that i would bring thee against them ?
and thou shalt come up against my people of israel , as a cloud to cover the land ; it shall be in the latter days , and i will bring thee against my land , that the heathen may know me , when i shall be sanctified in thee , o gog , before their eyes .
for in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have i spoken , surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of israel ;
and it shall come to pass at the same time when gog shall come against the land of israel , saith the lord god , that my fury shall come up in my face .
to take a spoil , and to take a prey ; to turn thine hand upon the desolate places that are now inhabited , and upon the people that are gathered out of the nations , which have gotten cattle and goods , that dwell in the midst of the land .
and thou shalt come from thy place out of the north parts , thou , and many people with thee , all of them riding upon horses , a great company , and a mighty army :
therefore , son of man , prophesy and say unto gog , thus saith the lord god ; in that day when my people of israel dwelleth safely , shalt thou not know it ?
for their mother hath played the harlot : she that conceived them hath done shamefully : for she said , i will go after my lovers , that give me my bread and my water , my wool and my flax , mine oil and my drink .
and i will not have mercy upon her children ; for they be the children of whoredoms .
and i will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains , saith the lord god : every man ' s sword shall be against his brother .
lest i strip her naked , and set her as in the day that she was born , and make her as a wilderness , and set her like a dry land , and slay her with thirst .
but of all clean fowls ye may eat .
and i will plead against him with pestilence and with blood ; and i will rain upon him , and upon his bands , and upon the many people that are with him , an overflowing rain , and great hailstones , fire , and brimstone .
plead with your mother , plead : for she is not my wife , neither am i her husband : let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight , and her adulteries from between her breasts ;
therefore will i return , and take away my corn in the time thereof , and my wine in the season thereof , and will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness .
thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed , that the field bringeth forth year by year .
for she did not know that i gave her corn , and wine , and oil , and multiplied her silver and gold , which they prepared for baal .
and she shall follow after her lovers , but she shall not overtake them ; and she shall seek them , but shall not find them : then shall she say , i will go and return to my first husband ; for then was it better with me than now .
and if the way be too long for thee , so that thou art not able to carry it ; or if the place be too far from thee , which the lord thy god shall choose to set his name there , when the lord thy god hath blessed thee :
therefore , behold , i will hedge up thy way with thorns , and make a wall , that she shall not find her paths .
therefore the lord was very angry with israel , and removed them out of his sight : there was none left but the tribe of judah only .
then shalt thou turn it into money , and bind up the money in thine hand , and shalt go unto the place which the lord thy god shall choose :
and they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire , and used divination and enchantments , and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the lord , to provoke him to anger .
and thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul lusteth after , for oxen , or for sheep , or for wine , or for strong drink , or for whatsoever thy soul desireth : and thou shalt eat there before the lord thy god , and thou shalt rejoice , thou , and thine household ,
and the levite that is within thy gates ; thou shalt not forsake him ; for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee .
also judah kept not the commandments of the lord their god , but walked in the statutes of israel which they made .
at the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase the same year , and shalt lay it up within thy gates :
notwithstanding they would not hear , but hardened their necks , like to the neck of their fathers , that did not believe in the lord their god .
say ye unto your brethren , ammi ; and to your sisters , ru - hamah .
and they left all the commandments of the lord their god , and made them molten images , even two calves , and made a grove , and worshipped all the host of heaven , and served baal .
they feared the lord , and served their own gods , after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence .
unto this day they do after the former manners : they fear not the lord , neither do they after their statutes , or after their ordinances , or after the law and commandment which the lord commanded the children of jacob , whom he named israel ;
and the avites made nibhaz and tartak , and the sepharvites burnt their children in fire to adrammelech and anammelech , the gods of sepharvaim .
so they feared the lord , and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places , which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places .
and the men of babylon made succoth - benoth , and the men of cuth made nergal , and the men of hamath made ashima ,
thus will i magnify myself , and sanctify myself ; and i will be known in the eyes of many nations , and they shall know that i am the lord .
but these are they of which ye shall not eat : the eagle , and ossifrage , and the ospray ,
and the glede , and the kite , and the vulture after his kind ,
and whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye may not eat ; it is unclean unto you .
of all clean birds ye shall eat .
the little owl , and the great owl , and the swan ,
and the pelican , and the gier eagle , and the cormorant ,
howbeit every nation made gods of their own , and put them in the houses of the high places which the samaritans had made , every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt .
and every raven after his kind ,
then one of the priests whom they had carried away from samaria came and dwelt in bethel , and taught them how they should fear the lord .
and the owl , and the night hawk , and the cuckow , and the hawk after his kind ,
then the king of assyria commanded , saying , carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence ; and let them go and dwell there , and let him teach them the manner of the god of the land .
and so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there , that they feared not the lord : therefore the lord sent lions among them , which slew some of them .
and the stork , and the heron after her kind , and the lapwing , and the bat .
and the king of assyria brought men from babylon , and from cuthah , and from ava , and from hamath , and from sepharvaim , and placed them in the cities of samaria instead of the children of israel : and they possessed samaria , and dwelt in the cities thereof .
and every creeping thing that flieth is unclean unto you : they shall not be eaten .
and thou shalt say , i will go up to the land of unwalled villages ; i will go to them that are at rest , that dwell safely , all of them dwelling without walls , and having neither bars nor gates ,
thus saith the lord god ; it shall also come to pass , that at the same time shall things come into thy mind , and thou shalt think an evil thought :
then shall his mind change , and he shall pass over , and offend , imputing this his power unto his god .
art thou not from everlasting , o lord my god , mine holy one ? we shall not die . o lord , thou hast ordained them for judgment ; and , o mighty god , thou hast established them for correction .
and they shall scoff at the kings , and the princes shall be a scorn unto them : they shall deride every strong hold ; for they shall heap dust , and take it .
ye shall not respect persons in judgment ; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great ; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man ; for the judgment is god ' s : and the cause that is too hard for you , bring it unto me , and i will hear it .
and i charged your judges at that time , saying , hear the causes between your brethren , and judge righteously between every man and his brother , and the stranger that is with him .
they take up all of them with the angle , they catch them in their net , and gather them in their drag : therefore they rejoice and are glad .
and when we departed from horeb , we went through all that great and terrible wilderness , which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the amorites , as the lord our god commanded us ; and we came to kadesh - barnea .
and makest men as the fishes of the sea , as the creeping things , that have no ruler over them ?
and i commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do .
thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil , and canst not look on iniquity : wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously , and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he ?
shall they therefore empty their net , and not spare continually to slay the nations ?
( the lord god of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are , and bless you , as he hath promised you ! )
the lord your god hath multiplied you , and , behold , ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude .
take you wise men , and understanding , and known among your tribes , and i will make them rulers over you .
how can i myself alone bear your cumbrance , and your burden , and your strife ?
so i took the chief of your tribes , wise men , and known , and made them heads over you , captains over thousands , and captains over hundreds , and captains over fifties , and captains over tens , and officers among your tribes .
and it came to pass , when jesus had finished all these sayings , he said unto his disciples ,
then assembled together the chief priests , and the scribes , and the elders of the people , unto the palace of the high priest , who was called caiaphas ,
ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover , and the son of man is betrayed to be crucified .
but they said , not on the feast day , lest there be an uproar among the people .
and consulted that they might take jesus by subtilty , and kill him .
there came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment , and poured it on his head , as he sat at meat .
now when jesus was in bethany , in the house of simon the leper ,
for this ointment might have been sold for much , and given to the poor .
but when his disciples saw it , they had indignation , saying , to what purpose is this waste ?
then i said unto you , dread not , neither be afraid of them .
and if she be not able to bring a lamb , then she shall bring two turtles , or two young pigeons ; the one for the burnt offering , and the other for a sin offering : and the priest shall make an atonement for her , and she shall be clean .
speak unto the children of israel , saying , if a woman have conceived seed , and born a man child : then she shall be unclean seven days ; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean .
and ye came near unto me every one of you , and said , we will send men before us , and they shall search us out the land , and bring us word again by what way we must go up , and into what cities we shall come .
behold , the lord thy god hath set the land before thee : go up and possess it , as the lord god of thy fathers hath said unto thee ; fear not , neither be discouraged .
and i said unto you , ye are come unto the mountain of the amorites , which the lord our god doth give unto us .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
notwithstanding ye would not go up , but rebelled against the commandment of the lord your god :
who shall offer it before the lord , and make an atonement for her ; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood . this is the law for her that hath born a male or a female .
and they took of the fruit of the land in their hands , and brought it down unto us , and brought us word again , and said , it is a good land which the lord our god doth give us .
and she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days ; she shall touch no hallowed thing , nor come into the sanctuary , until the days of her purifying be fulfilled .
and they turned and went up into the mountain , and came unto the valley of eshcol , and searched it out .
but if she bear a maid child , then she shall be unclean two weeks , as in her separation : and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days .
and the saying pleased me well : and i took twelve men of you , one of a tribe :
for there must be also heresies among you , that they which are approved may be made manifest among you .
for first of all , when ye come together in the church , i hear that there be divisions among you ; and i partly believe it .
nevertheless neither is the man without the woman , neither the woman without the man , in the lord .
for this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels .
judge in yourselves : is it comely that a woman pray unto god uncovered ?
for as the woman is of the man , even so is the man also by the woman ; but all things of god .
now in this that i declare unto you i praise you not , that ye come together not for the better , but for the worse .
but if any man seem to be contentious , we have no such custom , neither the churches of god .
the vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of thy god , those deliver thou before the god of jerusalem .
and to carry the silver and gold , which the king and his counsellers have freely offered unto the god of israel , whose habitation is in jerusalem ,
and all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of babylon , with the freewill offering of the people , and of the priests , offering willingly for the house of their god which is in jerusalem :
that thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks , rams , lambs , with their meat offerings and their drink offerings , and offer them upon the altar of the house of your god which is in jerusalem .
and whatsoever shall seem good to thee , and to thy brethren , to do with the rest of the silver and the gold , that do after the will of your god .
now this is the copy of the letter that the king artaxerxes gave unto ezra the priest , the scribe , even a scribe of the words of the commandments of the lord , and of his statutes to israel .
artaxerxes , king of kings , unto ezra the priest , a scribe of the law of the god of heaven , perfect peace , and at such a time .
i make a decree , that all they of the people of israel , and of his priests and levites , in my realm , which are minded of their own freewill to go up to jerusalem , go with thee .
forasmuch as thou art sent of the king , and of his seven counsellers , to inquire concerning judah and jerusalem , according to the law of thy god which is in thine hand ;
for ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the lord , and to do it , and to teach in israel statutes and judgments .
for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily , eateth and drinketh damnation to himself , not discerning the lord ' s body .
and when he had given thanks , he brake it , and said , take , eat : this is my body , which is broken for you : this do in remembrance of me .
but let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice : let them ever shout for joy , because thou defendest them : let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee .
for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you , that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread :
what ? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in ? or despise ye the church of god , and shame them that have not ? what shall i say to you ? shall i praise you in this ? i praise you not .
for in eating every one taketh before other his own supper : and one is hungry , and another is drunken .
for thou , lord , wilt bless the righteous ; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield .
but let a man examine himself , and so let him eat of that bread , and drink of that cup .
wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread , and drink this cup of the lord , unworthily , shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord .
for as often as ye eat this bread , and drink this cup , ye do shew the lord ' s death till he come .
after the same manner also he took the cup , when he had supped , saying , this cup is the new testament in my blood : this do ye , as oft as ye drink it , in remembrance of me .
there went up a smoke out of his nostrils , and fire out of his mouth devoured : coals were kindled by it .
then the earth shook and trembled ; the foundations of heaven moved and shook , because he was wroth .
and hath extended mercy unto me before the king , and his counsellers , and before all the king ' s mighty princes . and i was strengthened as the hand of the lord my god was upon me , and i gathered together out of israel chief men to go up with me .
in my distress i called upon the lord , and cried to my god : and he did hear my voice out of his temple , and my cry did enter into his ears .
when ye come together therefore into one place , this is not to eat the lord ' s supper .
and whosoever will not do the law of thy god , and the law of the king , let judgment be executed speedily upon him , whether it be unto death , or to banishment , or to confiscation of goods , or to imprisonment .
when the waves of death compassed me , the floods of ungodly men made me afraid ;
blessed be the lord god of our fathers , which hath put such a thing as this in the king ' s heart , to beautify the house of the lord which is in jerusalem :
i will call on the lord , who is worthy to be praised : so shall i be saved from mine enemies .
also we certify you , that touching any of the priests and levites , singers , porters , nethinims , or ministers of this house of god , it shall not be lawful to impose toll , tribute , or custom , upon them .
and thou , ezra , after the wisdom of thy god , that is in thine hand , set magistrates and judges , which may judge all the people that are beyond the river , all such as know the laws of thy god ; and teach ye them that know them not .
unto an hundred talents of silver , and to an hundred measures of wheat , and to an hundred baths of wine , and to an hundred baths of oil , and salt without prescribing how much .
and whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy god , which thou shalt have occasion to bestow , bestow it out of the king ' s treasure house .
and i , even i artaxerxes the king , do make a decree to all the treasurers which are beyond the river , that whatsoever ezra the priest , the scribe of the law of the god of heaven , shall require of you , it be done speedily ,
and david spake unto the lord the words of this song in the day that the lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies , and out of the hand of saul :
have we not all one father ? hath not one god created us ? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother , by profaning the covenant of our fathers ?
and he said , the lord is my rock , and my fortress , and my deliverer ;
judah hath dealt treacherously , and an abomination is committed in israel and in jerusalem ; for judah hath profaned the holiness of the lord which he loved , and hath married the daughter of a strange god .
the god of my rock ; in him will i trust : he is my shield , and the horn of my salvation , my high tower , and my refuge , my saviour ; thou savest me from violence .
the lord will cut off the man that doeth this , the master and the scholar , out of the tabernacles of jacob , and him that offereth an offering unto the lord of hosts .
and there remained among the children of israel seven tribes , which had not yet received their inheritance .
and the whole congregation of the children of israel assembled together at shiloh , and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there . and the land was subdued before them .
and the men arose , and went away : and joshua charged them that went to describe the land , saying , go and walk through the land , and describe it , and come again to me , that i may here cast lots for you before the lord in shiloh .
but the levites have no part among you ; for the priesthood of the lord is their inheritance : and gad , and reuben , and half the tribe of manasseh , have received their inheritance beyond jordan on the east , which moses the servant of the lord gave them .
so he set it before them , and they did eat , and left thereof , according to the word of the lord .
and the men went and passed through the land , and described it by cities into seven parts in a book , and came again to joshua to the host at shiloh .
and his servitor said , what , should i set this before an hundred men ? he said again , give the people , that they may eat : for thus saith the lord , they shall eat , and shall leave thereof .
give out from among you three men for each tribe : and i will send them , and they shall rise , and go through the land , and describe it according to the inheritance of them ; and they shall come again to me .
and there came a man from baal - shalisha , and brought the man of god bread of the firstfruits , twenty loaves of barley , and full ears of corn in the husk thereof . and he said , give unto the people , that they may eat .
and joshua said unto the children of israel , how long are ye slack to go to possess the land , which the lord god of your fathers hath given you ?
but he said , then bring meal . and he cast it into the pot ; and he said , pour out for the people , that they may eat . and there was no harm in the pot .
ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts , and bring the description hither to me , that i may cast lots for you here before the lord our god .
so they poured out for the men to eat . and it came to pass , as they were eating of the pottage , that they cried out , and said , o thou man of god , there is death in the pot . and they could not eat thereof .
and they shall divide it into seven parts : judah shall abide in their coast on the south , and the house of joseph shall abide in their coasts on the north .
hearken unto me , ye stouthearted , that are far from righteousness :
for the lord , the god of israel , saith that he hateth putting away : for one covereth violence with his garment , saith the lord of hosts : therefore take heed to your spirit , that ye deal not treacherously .
i bring near my righteousness ; it shall not be far off , and my salvation shall not tarry : and i will place salvation in zion for israel my glory .
and did not he make one ? yet had he the residue of the spirit . and wherefore one ? that he might seek a godly seed . therefore take heed to your spirit , and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth .
declaring the end from the beginning , and from ancient times the things that are not yet done , saying , my counsel shall stand , and i will do all my pleasure :
yet ye say , wherefore ? because the lord hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth , against whom thou hast dealt treacherously : yet is she thy companion , and the wife of thy covenant .
calling a ravenous bird from the east , the man that executeth my counsel from a far country : yea , i have spoken it , i will also bring it to pass ; i have purposed it , i will also do it .
and this have ye done again , covering the altar of the lord with tears , with weeping , and with crying out , insomuch that he regardeth not the offering any more , or receiveth it with good will at your hand .
and elisha came again to gilgal : and there was a dearth in the land ; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him : and he said unto his servant , set on the great pot , and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets .
then she went in , and fell at his feet , and bowed herself to the ground , and took up her son , and went out .
and one went out into the field to gather herbs , and found a wild vine , and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full , and came and shred them into the pot of pottage : for they knew them not .
ye have wearied the lord with your words . yet ye say , wherein have we wearied him ? when ye say , every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of the lord , and he delighteth in them ; or , where is the god of judgment ?
and he went up , and lay upon the child , and put his mouth upon his mouth , and his eyes upon his eyes , and his hands upon his hands : and he stretched himself upon the child ; and the flesh of the child waxed warm .
he went in therefore , and shut the door upon them twain , and prayed unto the lord .
and he called gehazi , and said , call this shunammite . so he called her . and when she was come in unto him , he said , take up thy son .
then he returned , and walked in the house to and fro ; and went up , and stretched himself upon him : and the child sneezed seven times , and the child opened his eyes .
and the mother of the child said , as the lord liveth , and as thy soul liveth , i will not leave thee . and he arose , and followed her .
and when elisha was come into the house , behold , the child was dead , and laid upon his bed .
and gehazi passed on before them , and laid the staff upon the face of the child ; but there was neither voice , nor hearing . wherefore he went again to meet him , and told him , saying , the child is not awaked .
and i say also unto thee , that thou art peter , and upon this rock i will build my church ; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it .
and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven : and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven : and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven .
and simon peter answered and said , thou art the christ , the son of the living god .
and jesus answered and said unto him , blessed art thou , simon barjona : for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee , but my father which is in heaven .
and they said , some say that thou art john the baptist : some , elias ; and others , jeremias , or one of the prophets .
he saith unto them , but whom say ye that i am ?
then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread , but of the doctrine of the pharisees and of the sadducees .
when jesus came into the coasts of caesarea philippi , he asked his disciples , saying , whom do men say that i the son of man am ?
and when he had taken him , and brought him to his mother , he sat on her knees till noon , and then died .
how is it that ye do not understand that i spake it not to you concerning bread , that ye should beware of the leaven of the pharisees and of the sadducees ?
and she went up , and laid him on the bed of the man of god , and shut the door upon him , and went out .
i cried to thee , o lord ; and unto the lord i made supplication .
so she went and came unto the man of god to mount carmel . and it came to pass , when the man of god saw her afar off , that he said to gehazi his servant , behold , yonder is that shunammite :
lord , by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong : thou didst hide thy face , and i was troubled .
and she called unto her husband , and said , send me , i pray thee , one of the young men , and one of the asses , that i may run to the man of god , and come again .
and he said , wherefore wilt thou go to him to day ? it is neither new moon , nor sabbath . and she said , it shall be well .
for his anger endureth but a moment ; in his favour is life : weeping may endure for a night , but joy cometh in the morning .
then she said , did i desire a son of my lord ? did i not say , do not deceive me ?
then he said to gehazi , gird up thy loins , and take my staff in thine hand , and go thy way : if thou meet any man , salute him not ; and if any salute thee , answer him not again : and lay my staff upon the face of the child .
run now , i pray thee , to meet her , and say unto her , is it well with thee ? is it well with thy husband ? is it well with the child ? and she answered , it is well .
and he said unto his mother , the eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from thee , about which thou cursedst , and spakest of also in mine ears , behold , the silver is with me ; i took it . and his mother said , blessed be thou of the lord , my son .
for the son of man shall come in the glory of his father with his angels ; and then he shall reward every man according to his works .
and the man micah had an house of gods , and made an ephod , and teraphim , and consecrated one of his sons , who became his priest .
verily i say unto you , there be some standing here , which shall not taste of death , till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom .
yet he restored the money unto his mother ; and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver , and gave them to the founder , who made thereof a graven image and a molten image : and they were in the house of micah .
and when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother , his mother said , i had wholly dedicated the silver unto the lord from my hand for my son , to make a graven image and a molten image : now therefore i will restore it unto thee .
but he turned , and said unto peter , get thee behind me , satan : thou art an offence unto me : for thou savourest not the things that be of god , but those that be of men .
and micah said unto him , whence comest thou ? and he said unto him , i am a levite of bethlehemjudah , and i go to sojourn where i may find a place .
then said jesus unto his disciples , if any man will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
and the man departed out of the city from bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find a place : and he came to mount ephraim to the house of micah , as he journeyed .
for whosoever will save his life shall lose it : and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it .
and there was a young man out of bethlehemjudah of the family of judah , who was a levite , and he sojourned there .
for what is a man profited , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own soul ? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ?
then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was jesus the christ .
then peter took him , and began to rebuke him , saying , be it far from thee , lord : this shall not be unto thee .
let us make a little chamber , i pray thee , on the wall ; and let us set for him there a bed , and a table , and a stool , and a candlestick : and it shall be , when he cometh to us , that he shall turn in thither .
from that time forth began jesus to shew unto his disciples , how that he must go unto jerusalem , and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be killed , and be raised again the third day .
and it fell on a day , that he came thither , and he turned into the chamber , and lay there .
and in the fourth month , in the ninth day of the month , the famine was sore in the city , so that there was no bread for the people of the land .
and he said to gehazi his servant , call this shunammite . and when he had called her , she stood before him .
and he said unto him , say now unto her , behold , thou hast been careful for us with all this care ; what is to be done for thee ? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king , or to the captain of the host ? and she answered , i dwell among mine own people .
but the army of the chaldeans pursued after the king , and overtook zedekiah in the plains of jericho ; and all his army was scattered from him .
and he said , what then is to be done for her ? and gehazi answered , verily she hath no child , and her husband is old .
then they took the king , and carried him up unto the king of babylon to riblah in the land of hamath ; where he gave judgment upon him .
and he said , call her . and when he had called her , she stood in the door .
and he did that which was evil in the eyes of the lord , according to all that jehoiakim had done .
and he said , about this season , according to the time of life , thou shalt embrace a son . and she said , nay , my lord , thou man of god , do not lie unto thine handmaid .
for through the anger of the lord it came to pass in jerusalem and judah , till he had cast them out from his presence , that zedekiah rebelled against the king of babylon .
and the woman conceived , and bare a son at that season that elisha had said unto her , according to the time of life .
and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that nebuchadrezzar king of babylon came , he and all his army , against jerusalem , and pitched against it , and built forts against it round about .
so the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king zedekiah .
and he said unto his father , my head , my head . and he said to a lad , carry him to his mother .
zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign , and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem . and his mother ' s name was hamutal the daughter of jeremiah of libnah .
but when we are judged , we are chastened of the lord , that we should not be condemned with the world .
wherefore , my brethren , when ye come together to eat , tarry one for another .
and if any man hunger , let him eat at home ; that ye come not together unto condemnation . and the rest will i set in order when i come .
for if we would judge ourselves , we should not be judged .
for this cause many are weak and sickly among you , and many sleep .
and the soldiers platted a crown of thorns , and put it on his head , and they put on him a purple robe ,
reuben , simeon , levi , and judah ,
then pilate therefore took jesus , and scourged him .
now these are the names of the children of israel , which came into egypt ; every man and his household came with jacob .
pilate therefore went forth again , and saith unto them , behold , i bring him forth to you , that ye may know that i find no fault in him .
and said , hail , king of the jews ! and they smote him with their hands .
when the chief priests therefore and officers saw him , they cried out , saying , crucify him , crucify him . pilate saith unto them , take ye him , and crucify him : for i find no fault in him .
then came jesus forth , wearing the crown of thorns , and the purple robe . and pilate saith unto them , behold the man !
when pilate therefore heard that saying , he was the more afraid ;
now there arose up a new king over egypt , which knew not joseph .
the jews answered him , we have a law , and by our law he ought to die , because he made himself the son of god .
and the children of israel were fruitful , and increased abundantly , and multiplied , and waxed exceeding mighty ; and the land was filled with them .
and went again into the judgment hall , and saith unto jesus , whence art thou ? but jesus gave him no answer .
and he said unto his people , behold , the people of the children of israel are more and mightier than we :
dan , and naphtali , gad , and asher .
i will extol thee , o lord ; for thou hast lifted me up , and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me .
issachar , zebulun , and benjamin ,
o lord my god , i cried unto thee , and thou hast healed me .
and joseph died , and all his brethren , and all that generation .
o lord , thou hast brought up my soul from the grave : thou hast kept me alive , that i should not go down to the pit .
and all the souls that came out of the loins of jacob were seventy souls : for joseph was in egypt already .
sing unto the lord , o ye saints of his , and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness .
let the sea roar , and the fulness thereof : let the fields rejoice , and all that is therein .
o give thanks unto the lord ; for he is good ; for his mercy endureth for ever .
fear before him , all the earth : the world also shall be stable , that it be not moved .
let the heavens be glad , and let the earth rejoice : and let men say among the nations , the lord reigneth .
blessed be the lord god of israel for ever and ever . and all the people said , amen , and praised the lord .
so he left there before the ark of the covenant of the lord asaph and his brethren , to minister before the ark continually , as every day ' s work required :
and obed - edom with their brethren , threescore and eight ; obed - edom also the son of jeduthun and hosah to be porters :
and zadok the priest , and his brethren the priests , before the tabernacle of the lord in the high place that was at gibeon ,
i will arise and go to my father , and will say unto him , father , i have sinned against heaven , and before thee ,
and when he came to himself , he said , how many hired servants of my father ' s have bread enough and to spare , and i perish with hunger !
and am no more worthy to be called thy son : make me as one of thy hired servants .
and not many days after the younger son gathered all together , and took his journey into a far country , and there wasted his substance with riotous living .
and he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat : and no man gave unto him .
and he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country ; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine .
likewise , i say unto you , there is joy in the presence of the angels of god over one sinner that repenteth .
and the younger of them said to his father , father , give me the portion of goods that falleth to me . and he divided unto them his living .
and he said , a certain man had two sons :
sing unto the lord , all the earth ; shew forth from day to day his salvation .
declare his glory among the heathen ; his marvellous works among all nations .
he suffered no man to do them wrong : yea , he reproved kings for their sakes ,
and about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her , fear not ; for thou hast born a son . but she answered not , neither did she regard it .
saying , touch not mine anointed , and do my prophets no harm .
and she said , the glory is departed from israel : for the ark of god is taken .
and when they went from nation to nation , and from one kingdom to another people ;
and she named the child i - chabod , saying , the glory is departed from israel : because the ark of god was taken , and because of her father in law and her husband .
give unto the lord the glory due unto his name : bring an offering , and come before him : worship the lord in the beauty of holiness .
glory and honour are in his presence ; strength and gladness are in his place .
give unto the lord , ye kindreds of the people , give unto the lord glory and strength .
for great is the lord , and greatly to be praised : he also is to be feared above all gods .
and he was angry , and would not go in : therefore came his father out , and intreated him .
and he said unto him , thy brother is come ; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf , because he hath received him safe and sound .
and he called one of the servants , and asked what these things meant .
now his elder son was in the field : and as he came and drew nigh to the house , he heard musick and dancing .
for this my son was dead , and is alive again ; he was lost , and is found . and they began to be merry .
and bring hither the fatted calf , and kill it ; and let us eat , and be merry :
but the father said to his servants , bring forth the best robe , and put it on him ; and put a ring on his hand , and shoes on his feet :
and the son said unto him , father , i have sinned against heaven , and in thy sight , and am no more worthy to be called thy son .
and he arose , and came to his father . but when he was yet a great way off , his father saw him , and had compassion , and ran , and fell on his neck , and kissed him .
but as soon as this thy son was come , which hath devoured thy living with harlots , thou hast killed for him the fatted calf .
it was meet that we should make merry , and be glad : for this thy brother was dead , and is alive again ; and was lost , and is found .
and he said unto him , son , thou art ever with me , and all that i have is thine .
and he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone : and there was a rainbow round about the throne , in sight like unto an emerald .
and with them heman and jeduthun , and the rest that were chosen , who were expressed by name , to give thanks to the lord , because his mercy endureth for ever ;
and round about the throne were four and twenty seats : and upon the seats i saw four and twenty elders sitting , clothed in white raiment ; and they had on their heads crowns of gold .
and with them heman and jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound , and with musical instruments of god . and the sons of jeduthun were porters .
after this i looked , and , behold , a door was opened in heaven : and the first voice which i heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me ; which said , come up hither , and i will shew thee things which must be hereafter .
to offer burnt offerings unto the lord upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening , and to do according to all that is written in the law of the lord , which he commanded israel ;
and the first beast was like a lion , and the second beast like a calf , and the third beast had a face as a man , and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle .
and the four beasts had each of them six wings about him ; and they were full of eyes within : and they rest not day and night , saying , holy , holy , holy , lord god almighty , which was , and is , and is to come .
and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices : and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne , which are the seven spirits of god .
and all the people departed every man to his house : and david returned to bless his house .
and before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal : and in the midst of the throne , and round about the throne , were four beasts full of eyes before and behind .
and when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne , who liveth for ever and ever ,
and there came also nicodemus , which at the first came to jesus by night , and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes , about an hundred pound weight .
and after this joseph of arimathaea , being a disciple of jesus , but secretly for fear of the jews , besought pilate that he might take away the body of jesus : and pilate gave him leave . he came therefore , and took the body of jesus .
and again another scripture saith , they shall look on him whom they pierced .
for these things were done , that the scripture should be fulfilled , a bone of him shall not be broken .
but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side , and forthwith came there out blood and water .
thou turnest man to destruction ; and sayest , return , ye children of men .
for a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past , and as a watch in the night .
thou carriest them away as with a flood ; they are as a sleep : in the morning they are like grass which groweth up .
in the morning it flourisheth , and groweth up ; in the evening it is cut down , and withereth .
for we are consumed by thine anger , and by thy wrath are we troubled .
thou hast set our iniquities before thee , our secret sins in the light of thy countenance .
for all our days are passed away in thy wrath : we spend our years as a tale that is told .
then came the soldiers , and brake the legs of the first , and of the other which was crucified with him .
but when they came to jesus , and saw that he was dead already , they brake not his legs :
when jesus therefore had received the vinegar , he said , it is finished : and he bowed his head , and gave up the ghost .
the jews therefore , because it was the preparation , that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day , ( for that sabbath day was an high day , ) besought pilate that their legs might be broken , and that they might be taken away .
lord , thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations .
the lord shall reign for ever , even thy god , o zion , unto all generations . praise ye the lord .
forasmuch as there is none like unto thee , o lord ; thou art great , and thy name is great in might .
who would not fear thee , o king of nations ? for to thee doth it appertain : forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations , and in all their kingdoms , there is none like unto thee .
they deck it with silver and with gold ; they fasten it with nails and with hammers , that it move not .
they are upright as the palm tree , but speak not : they must needs be borne , because they cannot go . be not afraid of them ; for they cannot do evil , neither also is it in them to do good .
but they are altogether brutish and foolish : the stock is a doctrine of vanities .
silver spread into plates is brought from tarshish , and gold from uphaz , the work of the workman , and of the hands of the founder : blue and purple is their clothing : they are all the work of cunning men .
now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden ; and in the garden a new sepulchre , wherein was never man yet laid .
there laid they jesus therefore because of the jews ' preparation day ; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand .
thus saith the lord , learn not the way of the heathen , and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven ; for the heathen are dismayed at them .
for the customs of the people are vain : for one cutteth a tree out of the forest , the work of the hands of the workman , with the axe .
then took they the body of jesus , and wound it in linen clothes with the spices , as the manner of the jews is to bury .
hear ye the word which the lord speaketh unto you , o house of israel :
but they cried out , away with him , away with him , crucify him . pilate saith unto them , shall i crucify your king ? the chief priest answered , we have no king but caesar .
be ye mindful always of his covenant ; the word which he commanded to a thousand generations ;
and it was the preparation of the passover , and about the sixth hour : and he saith unto the jews , behold your king !
he is the lord our god ; his judgments are in all the earth .
when pilate therefore heard that saying , he brought jesus forth , and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the pavement , but in the hebrew , gabbatha .
and hath confirmed the same to jacob for a law , and to israel for an everlasting covenant ,
and it came to pass , when he made mention of the ark of god , that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate , and his neck brake , and he died : for he was an old man , and heavy . and he had judged israel forty years .
and from thenceforth pilate sought to release him : but the jews cried out , saying , if thou let this man go , thou art not caesar ' s friend : whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against caesar .
even of the covenant which he made with abraham , and of his oath unto isaac ;
and his daughter in law , phinehas ' wife , was with child , near to be delivered : and when she heard the tidings that the ark of god was taken , and that her father in law and her husband were dead , she bowed herself and travailed ; for her pains came upon her .
and pilate wrote a title , and put it on the cross . and the writing was , jesus of nazareth the king of the jews .
when ye were but few , even a few , and strangers in it .
and the man said unto eli , i am he that came out of the army , and i fled to day out of the army . and he said , what is there done , my son ?
where they crucified him , and two other with him , on either side one , and jesus in the midst .
saying , unto thee will i give the land of canaan , the lot of your inheritance ;
and the messenger answered and said , israel is fled before the philistines , and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people , and thy two sons also , hophni and phinehas , are dead , and the ark of god is taken .
and he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull , which is called in the hebrew golgotha :
and when eli heard the noise of the crying , he said , what meaneth the noise of this tumult ? and the man came in hastily , and told eli .
then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified . and they took jesus , and led him away .
now eli was ninety and eight years old ; and his eyes were dim , that he could not see .
and there ran a man of benjamin out of the army , and came to shiloh the same day with his clothes rent , and with earth upon his head .
and when he came , lo , eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching : for his heart trembled for the ark of god . and when the man came into the city , and told it , all the city cried out .
and the philistines fought , and israel was smitten , and they fled every man into his tent : and there was a very great slaughter ; for there fell of israel thirty thousand footmen .
and the ark of god was taken ; and the two sons of eli , hophni and phinehas , were slain .
seek the lord and his strength , seek his face continually .
glory ye in his holy name : let the heart of them rejoice that seek the lord .
o ye seed of israel his servant , ye children of jacob , his chosen ones .
remember his marvellous works that he hath done , his wonders , and the judgments of his mouth ;
then saith pilate unto him , speakest thou not unto me ? knowest thou not that i have power to crucify thee , and have power to release thee ?
jesus answered , thou couldest have no power at all against me , except it were given thee from above : therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin .
they said therefore among themselves , let us not rend it , but cast lots for it , whose it shall be : that the scripture might be fulfilled , which saith , they parted my raiment among them , and for my vesture they did cast lots . these things therefore the soldiers did .
then the soldiers , when they had crucified jesus , took his garments , and made four parts , to every soldier a part ; and also his coat : now the coat was without seam , woven from the top throughout .
when jesus therefore saw his mother , and the disciple standing by , whom he loved , he saith unto his mother , woman , behold thy son !
now there stood by the cross of jesus his mother , and his mother ' s sister , mary the wife of cleophas , and mary magdalene .
after this , jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished , that the scripture might be fulfilled , saith , i thirst .
then saith he to the disciple , behold thy mother ! and from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home .
now there was set a vessel full of vinegar : and they filled a spunge with vinegar , and put it upon hyssop , and put it to his mouth .
this title then read many of the jews : for the place where jesus was crucified was nigh to the city : and it was written in hebrew , and greek , and latin .
then said the chief priests of the jews to pilate , write not , the king of the jews ; but that he said , i am king of the jews .
pilate answered , what i have written i have written .
and if the priest see that , behold , the scab spreadeth in the skin , then the priest shall pronounce him unclean : it is a leprosy .
but if the scab spread much abroad in the skin , after that he hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing , he shall be seen of the priest again :
ho , every one that thirsteth , come ye to the waters , and he that hath no money ; come ye , buy , and eat ; yea , come , buy wine and milk without money and without price .
when the plague of leprosy is in a man , then he shall be brought unto the priest ;
if the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh , and in sight be not deeper than the skin , and the hair thereof be not turned white ; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven days :
seek ye the lord while he may be found , call ye upon him while he is near :
and the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh : and when the hair in the plague is turned white , and the plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh , it is a plague of leprosy : and the priest shall look on him , and pronounce him unclean .
behold , thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not , and nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the lord thy god , and for the holy one of israel ; for he hath glorified thee .
and the priest shall look on him again the seventh day : and , behold , if the plague be somewhat dark , and the plague spread not in the skin , the priest shall pronounce him clean : it is but a scab : and he shall wash his clothes , and be clean .
behold , i have given him for a witness to the people , a leader and commander to the people .
and the priest shall look on him the seventh day : and , behold , if the plague in his sight be at a stay , and the plague spread not in the skin ; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more :
for as the heavens are higher than the earth , so are my ways higher than your ways , and my thoughts than your thoughts .
when a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising , a scab , or a bright spot , and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy ; then he shall be brought unto aaron the priest , or unto one of his sons the priests :
for my thoughts are not your thoughts , neither are your ways my ways , saith the lord .
and the lord spake unto moses and aaron , saying ,
let the wicked forsake his way , and the unrighteous man his thoughts : and let him return unto the lord , and he will have mercy upon him ; and to our god , for he will abundantly pardon .
and he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple , and departed , and went and hanged himself .
then judas , which had betrayed him , when he saw that he was condemned , repented himself , and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders ,
saying , i have sinned in that i have betrayed the innocent blood . and they said , what is that to us ? see thou to that .
when the morning was come , all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against jesus to put him to death :
and when they had bound him , they led him away , and delivered him to pontius pilate the governor .
then was fulfilled that which was spoken by jeremy the prophet , saying , and they took the thirty pieces of silver , the price of him that was valued , whom they of the children of israel did value ;
and they took counsel , and bought with them the potter ' s field , to bury strangers in .
this dream i king nebuchadnezzar have seen . now thou , o belteshazzar , declare the interpretation thereof , forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation : but thou art able ; for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee .
let his heart be changed from man ' s , and let a beast ' s heart be given unto him ; and let seven times pass over him .
this matter is by the decree of the watchers , and the demand by the word of the holy ones : to the intent that the living may know that the most high ruleth in the kingdom of men , and giveth it to whomsoever he will , and setteth up over it the basest of men .
thus were the visions of mine head in my bed ; i saw , and behold a tree in the midst of the earth , and the height thereof was great .
the tree grew , and was strong , and the height thereof reached unto heaven , and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth :
he cried aloud , and said thus , hew down the tree , and cut off his branches , shake off his leaves , and scatter his fruit : let the beasts get away from under it , and the fowls from his branches :
nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth , even with a band of iron and brass , in the tender grass of the field ; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven , and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth :
the leaves thereof were fair , and the fruit thereof much , and in it was meat for all : the beasts of the field had shadow under it , and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof , and all flesh was fed of it .
i saw in the visions of my head upon my bed , and , behold , a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven ;
what therefore god hath joined together , let not man put asunder .
for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother , and cleave to his wife ;
and they twain shall be one flesh : so then they are no more twain , but one flesh .
and jesus answered and said unto them , for the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept .
but from the beginning of the creation god made them male and female .
and he answered and said unto them , what did moses command you ?
and they said , moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement , and to put her away .
wherefore , o king , let my counsel be acceptable unto thee , and break off thy sins by righteousness , and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor ; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity .
all this came upon the king nebuchadnezzar .
and the pharisees came to him , and asked him , is it lawful for a man to put away his wife ? tempting him .
he is gone up to bajith , and to dibon , the high places , to weep : moab shall howl over nebo , and over medeba : on all their heads shall be baldness , and every beard cut off .
at the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of babylon .
and he arose from thence , and cometh into the coasts of judaea by the farther side of jordan : and the people resort unto him again ; and , as he was wont , he taught them again .
the burden of moab . because in the night ar of moab is laid waste , and brought to silence ; because in the night kir of moab is laid waste , and brought to silence ;
and heshbon shall cry , and elealeh : their voice shall be heard even unto jahaz : therefore the armed soldiers of moab shall cry out ; his life shall be grievous unto him .
in their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth : on the tops of their houses , and in their streets , every one shall howl , weeping abundantly .
for the waters of nimrim shall be desolate : for the hay is withered away , the grass faileth , there is no green thing .
my heart shall cry out for moab ; his fugitives shall flee unto zoar , an heifer of three years old : for by the mounting up of luhith with weeping shall they go it up ; for in the way of horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction .
the tree that thou sawest , which grew , and was strong , whose height reached unto the heaven , and the sight thereof to all the earth ;
whose leaves were fair , and the fruit thereof much , and in it was meat for all ; under which the beasts of the field dwelt , and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation :
it is thou , o king , that art grown and become strong : for thy greatness is grown , and reacheth unto heaven , and thy dominion to the end of the earth .
this is the interpretation , o king , and this is the decree of the most high , which is come upon my lord the king :
and whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots ; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee , after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule .
therefore the abundance they have gotten , and that which they have laid up , shall they carry away to the brook of the willows .
for the cry is gone round about the borders of moab ; the howling thereof unto eglaim , and the howling thereof unto beer - elim .
for the waters of dimon shall be full of blood : for i will bring more upon dimon , lions upon him that escapeth of moab , and upon the remnant of the land .
afterward shall the children of israel return , and seek the lord their god , and david their king ; and shall fear the lord and his goodness in the latter days .
then said the lord unto me , go yet , love a woman beloved of her friend , yet an adulteress , according to the love of the lord toward the children of israel , who look to other gods , and love flagons of wine .
so i bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver , and for an homer of barley , and an half homer of barley :
for the children of israel shall abide many days without a king , and without a prince , and without a sacrifice , and without an image , and without an ephod , and without teraphim :
now i nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the king of heaven , all whose works are truth , and his ways judgment : and those that walk in pride he is able to abase .
and at the end of the days i nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven , and mine understanding returned unto me , and i blessed the most high , and i praised and honoured him that liveth for ever , whose dominion is an everlasting dominion , and his kingdom is from generation to generation :
and all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing : and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven , and among the inhabitants of the earth : and none can stay his hand , or say unto him , what doest thou ?
and they shall drive thee from men , and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field : they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen , and seven times shall pass over thee , until thou know that the most high ruleth in the kingdom of men , and giveth it to whomsoever he will .
the same hour was the thing fulfilled upon nebuchadnezzar : and he was driven from men , and did eat grass as oxen , and his body was wet with the dew of heaven , till his hairs were grown like eagles ' feathers , and his nails like birds ' claws .
the king spake , and said , is not this great babylon , that i have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power , and for the honour of my majesty ?
while the word was in the king ' s mouth , there fell a voice from heaven , saying , o king nebuchadnezzar , to thee it is spoken ; the kingdom is departed from thee .
also unto thee , o lord , belongeth mercy : for thou renderest to every man according to his work .
god hath spoken once ; twice have i heard this ; that power belongeth unto god .
trust not in oppression , and become not vain in robbery : if riches increase , set not your heart upon them .
the waters made him great , the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants , and sent out her little rivers unto all the trees of the field .
therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field , and his boughs were multiplied , and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters , when he shot forth .
son of man , speak unto pharaoh king of egypt , and to his multitude ; whom art thou like in thy greatness ?
behold , the assyrian was a cedar in lebanon with fair branches , and with a shadowing shroud , and of an high stature ; and his top was among the thick boughs .
i have made him fair by the multitude of his branches : so that all the trees of eden , that were in the garden of god , envied him .
all the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs , and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young , and under his shadow dwelt all great nations .
then answered i , and said unto him , what are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof ?
and i answered again , and said unto him , what be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves ?
and he answered me and said , knowest thou not what these be ? and i said , no , my lord .
then said he , these are the two anointed ones , that stand by the lord of the whole earth .
and it came to pass , when all the people were clean passed over jordan , that the lord spake unto joshua , saying ,
and joshua said unto them , pass over before the ark of the lord your god into the midst of jordan , and take ye up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder , according unto the number of the tribes of the children of israel :
then joshua called the twelve men , whom he had prepared of the children of israel , out of every tribe a man :
and command ye them , saying , take you hence out of the midst of jordan , out of the place where the priests ' feet stood firm , twelve stones , and ye shall carry them over with you , and leave them in the lodging place , where ye shall lodge this night .
take you twelve men out of the people , out of every tribe a man ,
and joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of jordan , in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood : and they are there unto this day .
that this may be a sign among you , that when your children ask their fathers in time to come , saying , what mean ye by these stones ?
then ye shall answer them , that the waters of jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the lord ; when it passed over jordan , the waters of jordan were cut off : and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of israel for ever .
let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee : and let such as love thy salvation say continually , let god be magnified .
let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say , aha , aha .
let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul : let them be turned backward , and put to confusion , that desire my hurt .
make haste , o god , to deliver me ; make haste to help me , o lord .
but i am poor and needy : make haste unto me , o god : thou art my help and my deliverer ; o lord , make no tarrying .
likewise when all the jews that were in moab , and among the ammonites , and in edom , and that were in all the countries , heard that the king of babylon had left a remnant of judah , and that he had set over them gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan ;
as for me , behold , i will dwell at mizpah to serve the chaldeans , which will come unto us : but ye , gather ye wine , and summer fruits , and oil , and put them in your vessels , and dwell in your cities that ye have taken .
and the lord said , hear what the unjust judge saith .
yet because this widow troubleth me , i will avenge her , lest by her continual coming she weary me .
and he would not for a while : but afterward he said within himself , though i fear not god , nor regard man ;
but gedaliah the son of ahikam said unto johanan the son of kareah , thou shalt not do this thing : for thou speakest falsely of ishmael .
and there was a widow in that city ; and she came unto him , saying , avenge me of mine adversary .
saying , there was in a city a judge , which feared not god , neither regarded man :
let them praise the name of the lord : for his name alone is excellent ; his glory is above the earth and heaven .
and said unto him , dost thou certainly know that baalis the king of the ammonites hath sent ishmael the son of nethaniah to slay thee ? but gedaliah the son of ahikam believed them not .
and he spake a parable unto them to this end , that men ought always to pray , and not to faint ;
both young men , and maidens ; old men , and children :
kings of the earth , and all people ; princes , and all judges of the earth :
even all the jews returned out of all places whither they were driven , and came to the land of judah , to gedaliah , unto mizpah , and gathered wine and summer fruits very much .
beasts , and all cattle ; creeping things , and flying fowl :
moreover johanan the son of kareah , and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields , came to gedaliah to mizpah ,
he also exalteth the horn of his people , the praise of all his saints ; even of the children of israel , a people near unto him . praise ye the lord .
and he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous , and despised others :
i tell you that he will avenge them speedily . nevertheless when the son of man cometh , shall he find faith on the earth ?
and shall not god avenge his own elect , which cry day and night unto him , though he bear long with them ?
and the speech pleased the lord , that solomon had asked this thing .
and god said unto him , because thou hast asked this thing , and hast not asked for thyself long life ; neither hast asked riches for thyself , nor hast asked the life of thine enemies ; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment ;
behold , i have done according to thy words : lo , i have given thee a wise and an understanding heart ; so that there was none like thee before thee , neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee .
therefore thus saith the lord concerning the king of assyria , he shall not come into this city , nor shoot an arrow there , nor come before it with shield , nor cast a bank against it .
and i have also given thee that which thou hast not asked , both riches , and honour : so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days .
for out of jerusalem shall go forth a remnant , and they that escape out of mount zion : the zeal of the lord of hosts shall do this .
and if thou wilt walk in my ways , to keep my statutes and my commandments , as thy father david did walk , then i will lengthen thy days .
and the remnant that is escaped of the house of judah shall yet again take root downward , and bear fruit upward .
and solomon awoke ; and , behold , it was a dream . and he came to jerusalem , and stood before the ark of the covenant of the lord , and offered up burnt offerings , and offered peace offerings , and made a feast to all his servants .
then came there two women , that were harlots , unto the king , and stood before him .
so sennacherib king of assyria departed , and went and returned , and dwelt at nineveh .
and the one woman said , o my lord , i and this woman dwell in one house ; and i was delivered of a child with her in the house .
and it came to pass that night , that the angel of the lord went out , and smote in the camp of the assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand : and when they arose early in the morning , behold , they were all dead corpses .
for i will defend this city , to save it , for mine own sake , and for my servant david ' s sake .
and this woman ' s child died in the night ; because she overlaid it .
by the way that he came , by the same shall he return , and shall not come into this city , saith the lord .
because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears , therefore i will put my hook in thy nose , and my bridle in thy lips , and i will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest .
and this shall be a sign unto thee , ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves , and in the second year that which springeth of the same ; and in the third year sow ye , and reap , and plant vineyards , and eat the fruits thereof .
therefore their inhabitants were of small power , they were dismayed and confounded ; they were as the grass of the field , and as the green herb , as the grass on the housetops , and as corn blasted before it be grown up .
but i know thy abode , and thy going out , and thy coming in , and thy rage against me .
and the other woman said , nay ; but the living is my son , and the dead is thy son . and this said , no ; but the dead is thy son , and the living is my son . thus they spake before the king .
then said the king , the one saith , this is my son that liveth , and thy son is the dead : and the other saith , nay ; but thy son is the dead , and my son is the living .
and she arose at midnight , and took my son from beside me , while thine handmaid slept , and laid it in her bosom , and laid her dead child in my bosom .
then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king , for her bowels yearned upon her son , and she said , o my lord , give her the living child , and in no wise slay it . but the other said , let it be neither mine nor thine , but divide it .
this is the word that the lord hath spoken concerning him ; the virgin the daughter of zion hath despised thee , and laughed thee to scorn ; the daughter of jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee .
and the king said , bring me a sword . and they brought a sword before the king .
then isaiah the son of amoz sent to hezekiah , saying , thus saith the lord god of israel , that which thou hast prayed to me against sennacherib king of assyria i have heard .
and the king said , divide the living child in two , and give half to the one , and half to the other .
whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed ? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice , and lifted up thine eyes on high ? even against the holy one of israel .
hast thou not heard long ago how i have done it , and of ancient times that i have formed it ? now have i brought it to pass , that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps .
and all israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged ; and they feared the king : for they saw that the wisdom of god was in him , to do judgment .
i have digged and drunk strange waters , and with the sole of my feet have i dried up all the rivers of besieged places .
and hezekiah prayed before the lord , and said , o lord god of israel , which dwellest between the cherubims , thou art the god , even thou alone , of all the kingdoms of the earth : thou hast made heaven and earth .
lord , bow down thine ear , and hear : open , lord , thine eyes , and see : and hear the words of sennacherib , which hath sent him to reproach the living god .
of a truth , lord , the kings of assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands ,
and have cast their gods into the fire : for they were no gods , but the work of men ' s hands , wood and stone : therefore they have destroyed them .
now therefore , o lord our god , i beseech thee , save thou us out of his hand , that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the lord god , even thou only .
and hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers , and read it : and hezekiah went up into the house of the lord , and spread it before the lord .
where is the king of hamath , and the king of arpad , and the king of the city of sepharvaim , of hena , and ivah ?
have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed ; as gozan , and haran , and rezeph , and the children of eden which were in thelasar ?
thus shall ye speak to hezekiah king of judah , saying , let not thy god in whom thou trustest deceive thee , saying , jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of assyria .
wherefore levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren ; the lord is his inheritance , according as the lord thy god promised him .
and the children of israel took their journey from beeroth of the children of jaakan to mosera : there aaron died , and there he was buried ; and eleazar his son ministered in the priest ' s office in his stead .
and i turned myself and came down from the mount , and put the tables in the ark which i had made ; and there they be , as the lord commanded me .
at that time the lord separated the tribe of levi , to bear the ark of the covenant of the lord , to stand before the lord to minister unto him , and to bless in his name , unto this day .
from thence they journeyed unto gudgodah ; and from gudgodah to jotbath , a land of rivers of waters .
at that time the lord said unto me , hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first , and come up unto me into the mount , and make thee an ark of wood .
and he wrote on the tables , according to the first writing , the ten commandments , which the lord spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly : and the lord gave them unto me .
and i made an ark of shittim wood , and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first , and went up into the mount , having the two tables in mine hand .
and hazar - shual , and balah , and azem ,
and they had in their inheritance beer - sheba , or sheba , and moladah ,
and ziklag , and beth - marcaboth , and hazar - susah ,
and eltolad , and bethul , and hormah ,
ain , remmon , and ether , and ashan ; four cities and their villages :
out of the portion of the children of judah was the inheritance of the children of simeon : for the part of the children of judah was too much for them : therefore the children of simeon had their inheritance within the inheritance of them .
and all the villages that were round about these cities to baalath - beer , ramath of the south . this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of simeon according to their families .
and the second lot came forth to simeon , even for the tribe of the children of simeon according to their families : and their inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of judah .
as a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks .
thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing , whereof every one beareth twins , and there is not one barren among them .
turn away thine eyes from me , for they have overcome me : thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from gilead .
thou art beautiful , o my love , as tirzah , comely as jerusalem , terrible as an army with banners .
of the tribe of aser were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of nepthalim were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of manasses were sealed twelve thousand .
i am my beloved ' s , and my beloved is mine : he feedeth among the lilies .
of the tribe of simeon were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of levi were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of issachar were sealed twelve thousand .
my beloved is gone down into his garden , to the beds of spices , to feed in the gardens , and to gather lilies .
of the tribe of zabulon were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of joseph were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of benjamin were sealed twelve thousand .
whither is thy beloved gone , o thou fairest among women ? whither is thy beloved turned aside ? that we may seek him with thee .
after this i beheld , and , lo , a great multitude , which no man could number , of all nations , and kindreds , and people , and tongues , stood before the throne , and before the lamb , clothed with white robes , and palms in their hands ;
and i saw another angel ascending from the east , having the seal of the living god : and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels , to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea ,
saying , hurt not the earth , neither the sea , nor the trees , till we have sealed the servants of our god in their foreheads .
and i heard the number of them which were sealed : and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of israel .
of the tribe of juda were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of reuben were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of gad were sealed twelve thousand .
my dove , my undefiled is but one ; she is the only one of her mother , she is the choice one of her that bare her . the daughters saw her , and blessed her ; yea , the queens and the concubines , and they praised her .
and after these things i saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth , holding the four winds of the earth , that the wind should not blow on the earth , nor on the sea , nor on any tree .
there are threescore queens , and fourscore concubines , and virgins without number .
jesus therefore , knowing all things that should come upon him , went forth , and said unto them , whom seek ye ?
they answered him , jesus of nazareth . jesus saith unto them , i am he . and judas also , which betrayed him , stood with them .
as soon then as he had said unto them , i am he , they went backward , and fell to the ground .
then asked he them again , whom seek ye ? and they said , jesus of nazareth .
when jesus had spoken these words , he went forth with his disciples over the brook cedron , where was a garden , into the which he entered , and his disciples .
and judas also , which betrayed him , knew the place : for jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples .
judas then , having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and pharisees , cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons .
jesus answered , i have told you that i am he : if therefore ye seek me , let these go their way :
that the saying might be fulfilled , which he spake , of them which thou gavest me have i lost none .
and they lifted up their voices , and said , jesus , master , have mercy on us .
and when he saw them , he said unto them , go shew yourselves unto the priests . and it came to pass , that , as they went , they were cleansed .
now the sons of issachar were , tola , and puah , jashub , and shimron , four .
and it came to pass , as he went to jerusalem , that he passed through the midst of samaria and galilee .
and as he entered into a certain village , there met him ten men that were lepers , which stood afar off :
and jesus answering said , were there not ten cleansed ? but where are the nine ?
there are not found that returned to give glory to god , save this stranger .
and one of them , when he saw that he was healed , turned back , and with a loud voice glorified god ,
and fell down on his face at his feet , giving him thanks : and he was a samaritan .
and the number of them , after their genealogy by their generations , heads of the house of the fathers , mighty men of valour , was twenty thousand and two hundred .
and he said unto him , arise , go thy way : thy faith hath made thee whole .
and the sons of bela ; ezbon , and uzzi , and uzziel , and jerimoth , and iri , five ; heads of the house of their fathers , mighty men of valour ; and were reckoned by their genealogies twenty and two thousand and thirty and four .
the sons of benjamin ; bela , and becher , and jediael , three .
and their brethren among all the families of issachar were valiant men of might , reckoned in all by their genealogies fourscore and seven thousand .
and with them , by their generations , after the house of their fathers , were bands of soldiers for war , six and thirty thousand men : for they had many wives and sons .
and the sons of uzzi ; izrahiah : and the sons of izrahiah ; michael , and obadiah , and joel , ishiah , five : all of them chief men .
so likewise ye , when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you , say , we are unprofitable servants : we have done that which was our duty to do .
and he said unto the disciples , the days will come , when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the son of man , and ye shall not see it .
and they shall say to you , see here ; or , see there : go not after them , nor follow them .
for as the lightning , that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven , shineth unto the other part under heaven ; so shall also the son of man be in his day .
but first must he suffer many things , and be rejected of this generation .
and as it was in the days of noe , so shall it be also in the days of the son of man .
they did eat , they drank , they married wives , they were given in marriage , until the day that noe entered into the ark , and the flood came , and destroyed them all .
likewise also as it was in the days of lot ; they did eat , they drank , they bought , they sold , they planted , they builded ;
but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven , and destroyed them all .
and abram went up out of egypt , he , and his wife , and all that he had , and lot with him , into the south .
and lot also , which went with abram , had flocks , and herds , and tents .
unto the place of the altar , which he had made there at the first : and there abram called on the name of the lord .
and he went on his journeys from the south even to bethel , unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning , between bethel and hai ;
and abram was very rich in cattle , in silver , and in gold .
is not the whole land before thee ? separate thyself , i pray thee , from me : if thou wilt take the left hand , then i will go to the right ; or if thou depart to the right hand , then i will go to the left .
and abram said unto lot , let there be no strife , i pray thee , between me and thee , and between my herdmen and thy herdmen ; for we be brethren .
and there was a strife between the herdmen of abram ' s cattle and the herdmen of lot ' s cattle : and the canaanite and the perizzite dwelled then in the land .
and the land was not able to bear them , that they might dwell together : for their substance was great , so that they could not dwell together .
neither shall they say , lo here ! or , lo there ! for , behold , the kingdom of god is within you .
and when he was demanded of the pharisees , when the kingdom of god should come , he answered them and said , the kingdom of god cometh not with observation :
for the moth shall eat them up like a garment , and the worm shall eat them like wool : but my righteousness shall be for ever , and my salvation from generation to generation .
hearken unto me , ye that know righteousness , the people in whose heart is my law ; fear ye not the reproach of men , neither be ye afraid of their revilings .
awake , awake , put on strength , o arm of the lord ; awake , as in the ancient days , in the generations of old . art thou not it that hath cut rahab , and wounded the dragon ?
hearken unto me , my people ; and give ear unto me , o my nation : for a law shall proceed from me , and i will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people .
for the lord shall comfort zion : he will comfort all her waste places ; and he will make her wilderness like eden , and her desert like the garden of the lord ; joy and gladness shall be found therein , thanksgiving , and the voice of melody .
my righteousness is near ; my salvation is gone forth , and mine arms shall judge the people ; the isles shall wait upon me , and on mine arm shall they trust .
look unto abraham your father , and unto sarah that bare you : for i called him alone , and blessed him , and increased him .
hearken to me , ye that follow after righteousness , ye that seek the lord : look unto the rock whence ye are hewn , and to the hole of the pit whence ye are digged .
and the angel of the lord appeared unto him , and said unto him , the lord is with thee , thou mighty man of valour .
and i said unto you , i am the lord your god ; fear not the gods of the amorites , in whose land ye dwell : but ye have not obeyed my voice .
and there came an angel of the lord , and sat under an oak which was in ophrah , that pertained unto joash the abi - ezrite : and his son gideon threshed wheat by the winepress , to hide it from the midianites .
and the lord said unto him , surely i will be with thee , and thou shalt smite the midianites as one man .
and he said unto him , if now i have found grace in thy sight , then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me .
and the lord looked upon him , and said , go in this thy might , and thou shalt save israel from the hand of the midianites : have not i sent thee ?
and he said unto him , oh my lord , wherewith shall i save israel ? behold , my family is poor in manasseh , and i am the least in my father ' s house .
depart not hence , i pray thee , until i come unto thee , and bring forth my present , and set it before thee . and he said , i will tarry until thou come again .
and gideon went in , and made ready a kid , and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour : the flesh he put in a basket , and he put the broth in a pot , and brought it out unto him under the oak , and presented it .
and they answered and said unto him , where , lord ? and he said unto them , wheresoever the body is , thither will the eagles be gathered together .
two men shall be in the field ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
two women shall be grinding together ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
i tell you , in that night there shall be two men in one bed ; the one shall be taken , and the other shall be left .
whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it ; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it .
in that day , he which shall be upon the housetop , and his stuff in the house , let him not come down to take it away : and he that is in the field , let him likewise not return back .
remember lot ' s wife .
even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed .
and he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them , as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim : and he shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands .
and the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring down , lay low , and bring to the ground , even to the dust .
for in this mountain shall the hand of the lord rest , and moab shall be trodden down under him , even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill .
and there went a man of the house of levi , and took to wife a daughter of levi .
and his sister stood afar off , to wit what would be done to him .
and the daughter of pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river ; and her maidens walked along by the river ' s side ; and when she saw the ark among the flags , she sent her maid to fetch it .
and the woman conceived , and bare a son : and when she saw him that he was a goodly child , she hid him three months .
and when she could not longer hide him , she took for him an ark of bulrushes , and daubed it with slime and with pitch , and put the child therein ; and she laid it in the flags by the river ' s brink .
and pharaoh ' s daughter said to her , go . and the maid went and called the child ' s mother .
and pharaoh ' s daughter said unto her , take this child away , and nurse it for me , and i will give thee thy wages . and the woman took the child , and nursed it .
and when she had opened it , she saw the child : and , behold , the babe wept . and she had compassion on him , and said , this is one of the hebrews ' children .
and it came to pass , as he was worshipping in the house of nisroch his god , that adrammelech and sharezer his sons smote him with the sword : and they escaped into the land of armenia . and esar - haddon his son reigned in his stead .
then said his sister to pharaoh ' s daughter , shall i go and call to thee a nurse of the hebrew women , that she may nurse the child for thee ?
and they went their way , and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met ; and they loose him .
and certain of them that stood there said unto them , what do ye , loosing the colt ?
and it came to pass in the morning , that david wrote a letter to joab , and sent it by the hand of uriah .
and saith unto them , go your way into the village over against you : and as soon as ye be entered into it , ye shall find a colt tied , whereon never man sat ; loose him , and bring him .
and if any man say unto you , why do ye this ? say ye that the lord hath need of him ; and straightway he will send him hither .
and david said to uriah , tarry here to day also , and to morrow i will let thee depart . so uriah abode in jerusalem that day , and the morrow .
and many spread their garments in the way : and others cut down branches off the trees , and strawed them in the way .
and they that went before , and they that followed , cried , saying , hosanna ; blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord :
and when they had told david , saying , uriah went not down unto his house , david said unto uriah , camest thou not from thy journey ? why then didst thou not go down unto thine house ?
and they said unto them even as jesus had commanded : and they let them go .
and they brought the colt to jesus , and cast their garments on him ; and he sat upon him .
and charged the messenger , saying , when thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king ,
and the men of the city went out , and fought with joab : and there fell some of the people of the servants of david ; and uriah the hittite died also .
then joab sent and told david all the things concerning the war ;
and he wrote in the letter , saying , set ye uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle , and retire ye from him , that he may be smitten , and die .
and it came to pass , when joab observed the city , that he assigned uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were .
look to yourselves , that we lose not those things which we have wrought , but that we receive a full reward .
whosoever transgresseth , and abideth not in the doctrine of christ , hath not god . he that abideth in the doctrine of christ , he hath both the father and the son .
for the truth ' s sake , which dwelleth in us , and shall be with us for ever .
grace be with you , mercy , and peace , from god the father , and from the lord jesus christ , the son of the father , in truth and love .
the elder unto the elect lady and her children , whom i love in the truth ; and not i only , but also all they that have known the truth ;
and he was with them hid in the house of god six years : and athaliah reigned over the land .
and this is love , that we walk after his commandments . this is the commandment , that , as ye have heard from the beginning , ye should walk in it .
but when athaliah the mother of ahaziah saw that her son was dead , she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of judah .
and now i beseech thee , lady , not as though i wrote a new commandment unto thee , but that which we had from the beginning , that we love one another .
and god did so that night : for it was dry upon the fleece only , and there was dew on all the ground .
and when they came nigh to jerusalem , unto bethphage and bethany , at the mount of olives , he sendeth forth two of his disciples ,
behold , i will put a fleece of wool in the floor ; and if the dew be on the fleece only , and it be dry upon all the earth beside , then shall i know that thou wilt save israel by mine hand , as thou hast said .
and gideon said unto god , if thou wilt save israel by mine hand , as thou hast said ,
and gideon said unto god , let not thine anger be hot against me , and i will speak but this once : let me prove , i pray thee , but this once with the fleece ; let it now be dry only upon the fleece , and upon all the ground let there be dew .
and it was so : for he rose up early on the morrow , and thrust the fleece together , and wringed the dew out of the fleece , a bowl full of water .
and joash said unto all that stood against him , will ye plead for baal ? will ye save him ? he that will plead for him , let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning : if he be a god , let him plead for himself , because one hath cast down his altar .
then the men of the city said unto joash , bring out thy son , that he may die : because he hath cast down the altar of baal , and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it .
and the rest of the acts of solomon , and all that he did , and his wisdom , are they not written in the book of the acts of solomon ?
then all the midianites and the amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together , and went over , and pitched in the valley of jezreel .
and the time that solomon reigned in jerusalem over all israel was forty years .
and solomon slept with his fathers , and was buried in the city of david his father : and rehoboam his son reigned in his stead .
and he sent messengers throughout all manasseh ; who also was gathered after him : and he sent messengers unto asher , and unto zebulun , and unto naphtali ; and they came up to meet them .
but the spirit of the lord came upon gideon , and he blew a trumpet ; and abi - ezer was gathered after him .
and he spake this parable unto them , saying ,
and the pharisees and scribes murmured , saying , this man receiveth sinners , and eateth with them .
and when he hath found it , he layeth it on his shoulders , rejoicing .
what man of you , having an hundred sheep , if he lose one of them , doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness , and go after that which is lost , until he find it ?
i say unto you , that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth , more than over ninety and nine just persons , which need no repentance .
and when he cometh home , he calleth together his friends and neighbours , saying unto them , rejoice with me ; for i have found my sheep which was lost .
either what woman having ten pieces of silver , if she lose one piece , doth not light a candle , and sweep the house , and seek diligently till she find it ?
and when the men of the city arose early in the morning , behold , the altar of baal was cast down , and the grove was cut down that was by it , and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built .
and that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation , and the charge of the holy place , and the charge of the sons of aaron their brethren , in the service of the house of the lord .
then gideon took ten men of his servants , and did as the lord had said unto him : and so it was , because he feared his father ' s household , and the men of the city , that he could not do it by day , that he did it by night .
and if so be that the king ' s wrath arise , and he say unto thee , wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight ? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall ?
and build an altar unto the lord thy god upon the top of this rock , in the ordered place , and take the second bullock , and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down .
who smote abimelech the son of jerubbesheth ? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall , that he died in thebez ? why went ye nigh the wall ? then say thou , thy servant uriah the hittite is dead also .
and it came to pass the same night , that the lord said unto him , take thy father ' s young bullock , even the second bullock of seven years old , and throw down the altar of baal that thy father hath , and cut down the grove that is by it :
so the messenger went , and came and shewed david all that joab had sent him for .
and the messenger said unto david , surely the men prevailed against us , and came out unto us into the field , and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate .
and i will for this afflict the seed of david , but not for ever .
then david said unto the messenger , thus shalt thou say unto joab , let not this thing displease thee , for the sword devoureth one as well as another : make thy battle more strong against the city , and overthrow it : and encourage thou him .
and they said one to another , who hath done this thing ? and when they inquired and asked , they said , gideon the son of joash hath done this thing .
and unto his son will i give one tribe , that david my servant may have a light alway before me in jerusalem , the city which i have chosen me to put my name there .
and when the wife of uriah heard that uriah her husband was dead , she mourned for her husband .
and the angel of god said unto him , take the flesh and the unleavened cakes , and lay them upon this rock , and pour out the broth . and he did so .
and i will take thee , and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth , and shalt be king over israel .
howbeit i will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand : but i will make him prince all the days of his life for david my servant ' s sake , whom i chose , because he kept my commandments and my statutes :
but i will take the kingdom out of his son ' s hand , and will give it unto thee , even ten tribes .
( but he shall have one tribe for my servant david ' s sake , and for jerusalem ' s sake , the city which i have chosen out of all the tribes of israel : )
then gideon built an altar there unto the lord , and called it jehovah - shalom : unto this day it is yet in ophrah of the abi - ezrites .
and to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the lord in the sabbaths , in the new moons , and on the set feasts , by number , according to the order commanded unto them , continually before the lord :
and when gideon perceived that he was an angel of the lord , gideon said , alas , o lord god ! for because i have seen an angel of the lord face to face .
and to stand every morning to thank and praise the lord , and likewise at even ;
and he said to jeroboam , take thee ten pieces : for thus saith the lord , the god of israel , behold , i will rend the kingdom out of the hand of solomon , and will give ten tribes to thee :
then the angel of the lord put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand , and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes ; and there rose up fire out of the rock , and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes . then the angel of the lord departed out of his sight .
solomon sought therefore to kill jeroboam . and jeroboam arose , and fled into egypt , unto shishak king of egypt , and was in egypt until the death of solomon .
and aaron spake all the words which the lord had spoken unto moses , and did the signs in the sight of the people .
the pastures are clothed with flocks ; the valleys also are covered over with corn ; they shout for joy , they also sing .
they drop upon the pastures of the wilderness : and the little hills rejoice on every side .
thou crownest the year with thy goodness ; and thy paths drop fatness .
thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly : thou settlest the furrows thereof : thou makest it soft with showers : thou blessest the springing thereof .
then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him .
cry out and shout , thou inhabitant of zion : for great is the holy one of israel in the midst of thee .
behold , god is my salvation ; i will trust , and not be afraid : for the lord jehovah is my strength and my song ; he also is become my salvation .
therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation .
and in that day shall ye say , praise the lord , call upon his name , declare his doings among the people , make mention that his name is exalted .
sing unto the lord ; for he hath done excellent things : this is known in all the earth .
and in that day thou shalt say , o lord , i will praise thee : though thou wast angry with me , thine anger is turned away , and thou comfortedst me .
and when i shall put thee out , i will cover the heaven , and make the stars thereof dark ; i will cover the sun with a cloud , and the moon shall not give her light .
and they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy ; and did run to bring his disciples word .
all the bright lights of heaven will i make dark over thee , and set darkness upon thy land , saith the lord god .
and as they went to tell his disciples , behold , jesus met them , saying , all hail . and they came and held him by the feet , and worshipped him .
and i will lay thy flesh upon the mountains , and fill the valleys with thy height .
he is not here : for he is risen , as he said . come , see the place where the lord lay .
and go quickly , and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead ; and , behold , he goeth before you into galilee ; there shall ye see him : lo , i have told you .
i will also vex the hearts of many people , when i shall bring thy destruction among the nations , into the countries which thou hast not known .
in the end of the sabbath , as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week , came mary magdalene and the other mary to see the sepulchre .
and for fear of him the keepers did shake , and became as dead men .
and the angel answered and said unto the women , fear not ye : for i know that ye seek jesus , which was crucified .
and , behold , there was a great earthquake : for the angel of the lord descended from heaven , and came and rolled back the stone from the door , and sat upon it .
his countenance was like lightning , and his raiment white as snow :
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
and the priest shall go forth out of the camp ; and the priest shall look , and , behold , if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper ;
this shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing : he shall be brought unto the priest :
and the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water :
then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive and clean , and cedar wood , and scarlet , and hyssop :
and he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times , and shall pronounce him clean , and shall let the living bird loose into the open field .
as for the living bird , he shall take it , and the cedar wood , and the scarlet , and the hyssop , and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water :
but it shall be on the seventh day , that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows , even all his hair he shall shave off : and he shall wash his clothes , also he shall wash his flesh in water , and he shall be clean .
and he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes , and shave off all his hair , and wash himself in water , that he may be clean : and after that he shall come into the camp , and shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days .
then will i leave thee upon the land , i will cast thee forth upon the open field , and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon thee , and i will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee .
thus saith the lord god ; i will therefore spread out my net over thee with a company of many people ; and they shall bring thee up in my net .
son of man , take up a lamentation for pharaoh king of egypt , and say unto him , thou art like a young lion of the nations , and thou art as a whale in the seas : and thou camest forth with thy rivers , and troubledst the waters with thy feet , and fouledst their rivers .
and it came to pass in the twelfth year , in the twelfth month , in the first day of the month , that the word of the lord came unto me , saying ,
ish - bosheth saul ' s son was forty years old when he began to reign over israel , and reigned two years . but the house of judah followed david .
and he went down , and talked with the woman ; and she pleased samson well .
and the spirit of the lord came mightily upon him , and he rent him as he would have rent a kid , and he had nothing in his hand : but he told not his father or his mother what he had done .
and abner the son of ner , and the servants of ish - bosheth the son of saul , went out from mahanaim to gibeon .
and he took thereof in his hands , and went on eating , and came to his father and mother , and he gave them , and they did eat : but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion .
and the time that david was king in hebron over the house of judah was seven years and six months .
and after a time he returned to take her , and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion : and , behold , there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion .
so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud : for the glory of the lord had filled the house of god .
and there were three sons of zeruiah there , joab , and abishai , and asahel : and asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe .
poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth instruction : but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured .
and there was a very sore battle that day ; and abner was beaten , and the men of israel , before the servants of david .
the desire accomplished is sweet to the soul : but it is abomination to fools to depart from evil .
and samson went down to timnath , and saw a woman in timnath of the daughters of the philistines .
every prudent man dealeth with knowledge : but a fool layeth open his folly .
and it came to pass , when the priests were come out of the holy place : ( for all the priests that were present were sanctified , and did not then wait by course :
and asahel pursued after abner ; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following abner .
a wicked messenger falleth into mischief : but a faithful ambassador is health .
and abner said to joab , let the young men now arise , and play before us . and joab said , let them arise .
then his father and his mother said unto him , is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren , or among all my people , that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised philistines ? and samson said unto his father , get her for me ; for she pleaseth me well .
the law of the wise is a fountain of life , to depart from the snares of death .
and joab the son of zeruiah , and the servants of david , went out , and met together by the pool of gibeon : and they sat down , the one on the one side of the pool , and the other on the other side of the pool .
and he came up , and told his father and his mother , and said , i have seen a woman in timnath of the daughters of the philistines : now therefore get her for me to wife .
good understanding giveth favour : but the way of transgressors is hard .
and they caught every one his fellow by the head , and thrust his sword in his fellow ' s side ; so they fell down together : wherefore that place was called helkath - hazzurim , which is in gibeon .
then went samson down , and his father and his mother , to timnath , and came to the vineyards of timnath : and , behold , a young lion roared against him .
hope deferred maketh the heart sick : but when the desire cometh , it is a tree of life .
then there arose and went over by number twelve of benjamin , which pertained to ish - bosheth the son of saul , and twelve of the servants of david .
but his father and his mother knew not that it was of the lord , that he sought an occasion against the philistines : for at that time the philistines had dominion over israel .
whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed : but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded .
a good man leaveth an inheritance to his children ' s children : and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just .
evil pursueth sinners : but to the righteous good shall be repayed .
through desire a man , having separated himself , seeketh and intermeddleth with all wisdom .
he that walketh with wise men shall be wise : but a companion of fools shall be destroyed .
the words of a talebearer are as wounds , and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly .
he also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster .
a fool ' s lips enter into contention , and his mouth calleth for strokes .
a fool ' s mouth is his destruction , and his lips are the snare of his soul .
the words of a man ' s mouth are as deep waters , and the wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook .
it is not good to accept the person of the wicked , to overthrow the righteous in judgment .
a fool hath no delight in understanding , but that his heart may discover itself .
when the wicked cometh , then cometh also contempt , and with ignominy reproach .
and abner said again to asahel , turn thee aside from following me : wherefore should i smite thee to the ground ? how then should i hold up my face to joab thy brother ?
and abner said to him , turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left , and lay thee hold on one of the young men , and take thee his armour . but asahel would not turn aside from following of him .
then abner looked behind him , and said , art thou asahel ? and he answered , i am .
and abner and his men walked all that night through the plain , and passed over jordan , and went through all bithron , and they came to mahanaim .
so joab blew a trumpet , and all the people stood still , and pursued after israel no more , neither fought they any more .
and joab said , as god liveth , unless thou hadst spoken , surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother .
much food is in the tillage of the poor : but there is that is destroyed for want of judgment .
then abner called to joab , and said , shall the sword devour for ever ? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end ? how long shall it be then , ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren ?
he that spareth his rod hateth his son : but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes .
and the children of benjamin gathered themselves together after abner , and became one troop , and stood on the top of an hill .
the righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul : but the belly of the wicked shall want .
joab also and abishai pursued after abner : and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of ammah , that lieth before giah by the way of the wilderness of gibeon .
for i will surely deliver thee , and thou shalt not fall by the sword , but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee : because thou hast put thy trust in me , saith the lord .
and they took up asahel , and buried him in the sepulchre of his father , which was in bethlehem . and joab and his men went all night , and they came to hebron at break of day .
now the word of the lord came unto jeremiah , while he was shut up in the court of the prison , saying ,
but the servants of david had smitten of benjamin , and of abner ' s men , so that three hundred and threescore men died .
even they sent , and took jeremiah out of the court of the prison , and committed him unto gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan , that he should carry him home : so he dwelt among the people .
but i will deliver thee in that day , saith the lord : and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid .
go and speak to ebed - melech the ethiopian , saying , thus saith the lord of hosts , the god of israel ; behold , i will bring my words upon this city for evil , and not for good ; and they shall be accomplished in that day before thee .
now nebuchadrezzar king of babylon gave charge concerning jeremiah to nebuzar - adan the captain of the guard , saying ,
but nebuzar - adan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people , which had nothing , in the land of judah , and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time .
and king zedekiah the son of josiah reigned instead of coniah the son of jehoiakim , whom nebuchadrezzar king of babylon made king in the land of judah .
so nebuzar - adan the captain of the guard sent , and nebushasban , rab - saris , and nergal - sharezer , rabmag , and all the king of babylon ' s princes ;
but neither he , nor his servants , nor the people of the land , did hearken unto the words of the lord , which he spake by the prophet jeremiah .
take him , and look well to him , and do him no harm ; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee .
and zedekiah the king sent jehucal the son of shelemiah and zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest to the prophet jeremiah , saying , pray now unto the lord our god for us .
now jeremiah came in and went out among the people : for they had not put him into prison .
then pharoah ' s army was come forth out of egypt : and when the chaldeans that besieged jerusalem heard tidings of them , they departed from jerusalem .
then came the word of the lord unto the prophet jeremiah , saying ,
and the chaldeans shall come again , and fight against this city , and take it , and burn it with fire .
thus saith the lord , the god of israel ; thus shall ye say to the king of judah , that sent you unto me to inquire of me ; behold , pharaoh ' s army , which is come forth to help you , shall return to egypt into their own land .
thus saith the lord ; deceive not yourselves , saying , the chaldeans shall surely depart from us : for they shall not depart .
wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished : but he that gathereth by labour shall increase .
only by pride cometh contention : but with the well advised is wisdom .
and moses told aaron all the words of the lord who had sent him , and all the signs which he had commanded him .
and moses and aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of israel :
and the lord said to aaron , go into the wilderness to meet moses . and he went , and met him in the mount of god , and kissed him .
and it came to pass by the way in the inn , that the lord met him , and sought to kill him .
both for the shewbread , and for the fine flour for meat offering , and for the unleavened cakes , and for that which is baked in the pan , and for that which is fried , and for all manner of measure and size ;
then zipporah took a sharp stone , and cut off the foreskin of her son , and cast it at his feet , and said , surely a bloody husband art thou to me .
he measured it by the four sides : it had a wall round about , five hundred reeds long , and five hundred broad , to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place .
and thou shalt say unto pharaoh , thus saith the lord , israel is my son , even my firstborn :
and i say unto thee , let my son go , that he may serve me : and if thou refuse to let him go , behold , i will slay thy son , even thy firstborn .
and moses took his wife and his sons , and set them upon an ass , and he returned to the land of egypt : and moses took the rod of god in his hand .
then pharaoh said unto him , but what hast thou lacked with me , that , behold , thou seekest to go to thine own country ? and he answered , nothing : howbeit let me go in any wise .
and the sister of tahpenes bare him genubath his son , whom tahpenes weaned in pharaoh ' s house : and genubath was in pharaoh ' s household among the sons of pharaoh .
of the sons of uzziel ; michah the first , and jesiah the second .
and jeroboam the son of nebat , an ephrathite of zereda , solomon ' s servant , whose mother ' s name was zeruah , a widow woman , even he lifted up his hand against the king .
and he was an adversary to israel all the days of solomon , beside the mischief that hadad did : and he abhorred israel , and reigned over syria .
and he gathered men unto him , and became captain over a band , when david slew them of zobah : and they went to damascus , and dwelt therein , and reigned in damascus .
and god stirred him up another adversary , rezon the son of eliadah , which fled from his lord hadadezer king of zobah :
for david said , the lord god of israel hath given rest unto his people , that they may dwell in jerusalem for ever :
and also unto the levites ; they shall no more carry the tabernacle , nor any vessels of it for the service thereof .
and it came to pass at that time when jeroboam went out of jerusalem , that the prophet ahijah the shilonite found him in the way ; and he had clad himself with a new garment ; and they two were alone in the field :
for by the last words of david the levites were numbered from twenty years old and above :
and the man jeroboam was a mighty man of valour : and solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious , he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of joseph .
because their office was to wait on the sons of aaron for the service of the house of the lord , in the courts , and in the chambers , and in the purifying of all holy things , and the work of the service of the house of god ;
and this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king : solomon built millo , and repaired the breaches of the city of david his father .
the sons of merari ; mahli , and mushi . the sons of mahli ; eleazar , and kish .
and eleazar died , and had no sons , but daughters : and their brethren the sons of kish took them .
the sons of mushi ; mahli , and eder , and jeremoth , three .
these were the sons of levi after the house of their fathers ; even the chief of the fathers , as they were counted by number of names by their polls , that did the work for the service of the house of the lord , from the age of twenty years and upward .
and the lord said unto moses in midian , go , return into egypt : for all the men are dead which sought thy life .
and he shall be thy spokesman unto the people : and he shall be , even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth , and thou shalt be to him instead of god .
and thou shalt take this rod in thine hand , wherewith thou shalt do signs .
and moses went and returned to jethro his father in law , and said unto him , let me go , i pray thee , and return unto my brethren which are in egypt , and see whether they be yet alive . and jethro said to moses , go in peace .
and the lord said unto him , who hath made man ' s mouth ? or who maketh the dumb , or deaf , or the seeing , or the blind ? have not i the lord ?
and according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door in the head of the way , even the way directly before the wall toward the east , as one entereth into them .
now therefore go , and i will be with thy mouth , and teach thee what thou shalt say .
and the way before them was like the appearance of the chambers which were toward the north , as long as they , and as broad as they : and all their goings out were both according to their fashions , and according to their doors .
of the sons of hebron ; jeriah the first , amariah the second , jahaziel the third , and jekameam the fourth .
and he said , o my lord , send , i pray thee , by the hand of him whom thou wilt send .
the chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east , over against the separate place , and over against the building .
of the sons of izhar ; shelomith the chief .
the wind hath bound her up in her wings , and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices .
he measured the east side with the measuring reed , five hundred reeds , with the measuring reed round about .
now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house , he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east , and measured it round about .
when the priests enter therein , then shall they not go out of the holy place into the utter court , but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister ; for they are holy ; and shall put on other garments , and shall approach to those things which are for the people .
and moses said unto the lord , o my lord , i am not eloquent , neither heretofore , nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant : but i am slow of speech , and of a slow tongue .
and joshua said unto the children of israel , come hither , and hear the words of the lord your god .
he turned about to the west side , and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed .
and the lord said unto joshua , this day will i begin to magnify thee in the sight of all israel , that they may know that , as i was with moses , so i will be with thee .
he measured the south side , five hundred reeds , with the measuring reed .
and thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant , saying , when ye are come to the brink of the water of jordan , ye shall stand still in jordan .
he measured the north side , five hundred reeds , with the measuring reed round about .
and joshua spake unto the priests , saying , take up the ark of the covenant , and pass over before the people . and they took up the ark of the covenant , and went before the people .
and joshua said unto the people , sanctify yourselves : for to morrow the lord will do wonders among you .
for they shall eat , and not have enough : they shall commit whoredom , and shall not increase : because they have left off to take heed to the lord .
wherefore the lord said unto solomon , forasmuch as this is done of thee , and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes , which i have commanded thee , i will surely rend the kingdom from thee , and will give it to thy servant .
yet there shall be a space between you and it , about two thousand cubits by measure : come not near unto it , that ye may know the way by which ye must go : for ye have not passed this way heretofore .
and had commanded him concerning this thing , that he should not go after other gods : but he kept not that which the lord commanded .
and they commanded the people , saying , when ye see the ark of the covenant of the lord your god , and the priests the levites bearing it , then ye shall remove from your place , and go after it .
howbeit i will not rend away all the kingdom ; but will give one tribe to thy son for david my servant ' s sake , and for jerusalem ' s sake which i have chosen .
and it came to pass after three days , that the officers went through the host ;
notwithstanding in thy days i will not do it for david thy father ' s sake : but i will rend it out of the hand of thy son .
for it came to pass , when david was in edom , and joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain , after he had smitten every male in edom ;
and the lord stirred up an adversary unto solomon , hadad the edomite : he was of the king ' s seed in edom .
of the sons of gershom , shebuel was the chief .
that hadad fled , he and certain edomites of his father ' s servants with him , to go into egypt ; hadad being yet a little child .
ephraim is joined to idols : let him alone .
and the sons of eliezer were , rehabiah the chief . and eliezer had none other sons ; but the sons of rehabiah were very many .
( for six months did joab remain there with all israel , until he had cut off every male in edom : )
their drink is sour : they have committed whoredom continually : her rulers with shame do love , give ye .
now concerning moses the man of god , his sons were named of the tribe of levi .
and hadad found great favour in the sight of pharaoh , so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife , the sister of tahpenes the queen .
though thou , israel , play the harlot , yet let not judah offend ; and come not ye unto gilgal , neither go ye up to beth - aven , nor swear , the lord liveth .
the sons of moses were , gershom , and eliezer .
and they arose out of midian , and came to paran : and they took men with them out of paran , and they came to egypt , unto pharaoh king of egypt ; which gave him an house , and appointed him victuals , and gave him land .
for israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer : now the lord will feed them as a lamb in a large place .
the sons of kohath ; amram , ishar , hebron , and uzziel , four .
they sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains , and burn incense upon the hills , under oaks and poplars and elms , because the shadow thereof is good : therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom , and your spouses shall commit adultery .
the sons of amram ; aaron and moses : and aaron was separated , that he should sanctify the most holy things , he and his sons for ever , to burn incense before the lord , to minister unto him , and to bless in his name for ever .
i will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom , nor your spouses when they commit adultery : for themselves are separated with whores , and they sacrifice with harlots : therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall .
and the sons of shimei were , jahath , zina , and jeush , and beriah . these four were the sons of shimei .
whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart .
and jahath was the chief , and zizah the second : but jeush and beriah had not many sons ; therefore they were in one reckoning , according to their father ' s house .
my people ask counsel at their stocks , and their staff declareth unto them : for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err , and they have gone a whoring from under their god .
and saul ' s uncle said unto him and to his servant , whither went ye ? and he said , to seek the asses : and when we saw that they were no where , we came to samuel .
and one of the same place answered and said , but who is their father ? therefore it became a proverb , is saul also among the prophets ?
and it came to pass , when all that knew him beforetime saw that , behold , he prophesied among the prophets , then the people said one to another , what is this that is come unto the son of kish ? is saul also among the prophets ?
and when they came thither to the hill , behold , a company of prophets met him ; and the spirit of god came upon him , and he prophesied among them .
yea , every pot in jerusalem and in judah shall be holiness unto the lord of hosts : and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them , and seethe therein : and in that day there shall be no more the canaanite in the house of the lord of hosts .
and ye have this day rejected your god , who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations ; and ye have said unto him , nay , but set a king over us . now therefore present yourselves before the lord by your tribes , and by your thousands .
in that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses , holiness unto the lord ; and the pots in the lord ' s house shall be like the bowl ' s before the altar .
and said unto the children of israel , thus saith the lord god of israel , i brought up israel out of egypt , and delivered you out of the hand of the egyptians , and out of the hand of all kingdoms , and of them that oppressed you :
and samuel called the people together unto the lord to mizpeh ;
and saul said unto his uncle , he told us plainly that the asses were found . but of the matter of the kingdom , whereof samuel spake , he told him not .
and saul ' s uncle said , tell me , i pray thee , what samuel said unto you .
and they ran and fetched him thence : and when he stood among the people , he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward .
and it shall come to pass , that every one that is left of all the nations which came against jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the king , the lord of hosts , and to keep the feast of tabernacles .
therefore they inquired of the lord further , if the man should yet come thither . and the lord answered , behold , he hath hid himself among the stuff .
and it shall be , that whoso will not come up of all the families of the earth unto jerusalem to worship the king , the lord of hosts , even upon them shall be no rain .
and judah also shall fight at jerusalem ; and the wealth of all the heathen round about shall be gathered together , gold , and silver , and apparel , in great abundance .
and samuel said to all the people , see ye him whom the lord hath chosen , that there is none like him among all the people ? and all the people shouted , and said , god save the king .
and so shall be the plague of the horse , of the mule , of the camel , and of the ass , and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents , as this plague .
and this shall be the plague wherewith the lord will smite all the people that have fought against jerusalem ; their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet , and their eyes shall consume away in their holes , and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that a great tumult from the lord shall be among them ; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbour , and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour .
when he had caused the tribe of benjamin to come near by their families , the family of matri was taken , and saul the son of kish was taken : and when they sought him , he could not be found .
and when samuel had caused all the tribes of israel to come near , the tribe of benjamin was taken .
and men shall dwell in it , and there shall be no more utter destruction ; but jerusalem shall be safely inhabited .
but the children of belial said , how shall this man save us ? and they despised him , and brought him no presents . but he held his peace .
and saul also went home to gibeah ; and there went with him a band of men , whose hearts god had touched .
this shall be the punishment of egypt , and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles .
and if the family of egypt go not up , and come not , that have no rain ; there shall be the plague , wherewith the lord will smite the heathen that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles .
put them in fear , o lord : that the nations may know themselves to be but men . selah .
he spake of judas iscariot the son of simon : for he it was that should betray him , being one of the twelve .
jesus answered them , have not i chosen you twelve , and one of you is a devil ?
when they were at the great stone which is in gibeon , amasa went before them . and joab ' s garment that he had put on was girded unto him , and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof ; and as he went forth it fell out .
and david said to abishai , now shall sheba the son of bichri do us more harm than did absalom : take thou thy lord ' s servants , and pursue after him , lest he get him fenced cities , and escape us .
and there went out after him joab ' s men , and the cherethites , and the pelethites , and all the mighty men : and they went out of jerusalem , to pursue after sheba the son of bichri .
for the needy shall not alway be forgotten : the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever .
arise , o lord ; let not man prevail : let the heathen be judged in thy sight .
and they that know thy name will put their trust in thee : for thou , lord , hast not forsaken them that seek thee .
sing praises to the lord , which dwelleth in zion : declare among the people his doings .
when he maketh inquisition for blood , he remembereth them : he forgetteth not the cry of the humble .
that i may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of zion : i will rejoice in thy salvation .
the heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made : in the net which they hid is their own foot taken .
the lord is known by the judgment which he executeth : the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands . higgaion . selah .
the wicked shall be turned into hell , and all the nations that forget god .
therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which i command you this day , that ye may be strong , and go in and possess the land , whither ye go to possess it ;
and that ye may prolong your days in the land , which the lord sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed , a land that floweth with milk and honey .
and jesus , walking by the sea of galilee , saw two brethren , simon called peter , and andrew his brother , casting a net into the sea : for they were fishers .
from that time jesus began to preach , and to say , repent : for the kingdom of heaven is at hand .
and there happened to be there a man of belial , whose name was sheba , the son of bichri , a benjamite : and he blew a trumpet , and said , we have no part in david , neither have we inheritance in the son of jesse : every man to his tents , o israel .
the people which sat in darkness saw great light ; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up .
the land of zabulon , and the land of nephthalim , by the way of the sea , beyond jordan , galilee of the gentiles ;
so every man of israel went up from after david , and followed sheba the son of bichri : but the men of judah clave unto their king , from jordan even to jerusalem .
so amasa went to assemble the men of judah : but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him .
then said the king to amasa , assemble me the men of judah within three days , and be thou here present .
and he saith unto them , follow me , and i will make you fishers of men .
therefore thou shalt love the lord thy god , and keep his charge , and his statutes , and his judgments , and his commandments , alway .
then saith jesus unto him , get thee hence , satan : for it is written , thou shalt worship the lord thy god , and him only shalt thou serve .
and his miracles , and his acts , which he did in the midst of egypt unto pharaoh the king of egypt , and unto all his land ;
and know ye this day : for i speak not with your children which have not known , and which have not seen the chastisement of the lord your god , his greatness , his mighty hand , and his stretched out arm ,
and what he did unto you in the wilderness , until ye came into this place ;
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias the prophet , saying ,
and what he did unto the army of egypt , unto their horses , and to their chariots ; how he made the water of the red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you , and how the lord hath destroyed them unto this day ;
and leaving nazareth , he came and dwelt in capernaum , which is upon the sea coast , in the borders of zabulon and nephthalim :
but your eyes have seen all the great acts of the lord which he did .
now when jesus had heard that john was cast into prison , he departed into galilee ;
and what he did unto dathan and abiram , the sons of eliab , the son of reuben : how the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed them up , and their households , and their tents , and all the substance that was in their possession , in the midst of all israel :
then the devil leaveth him , and , behold , angels came and ministered unto him .
and going on from thence , he saw other two brethren , james the son of zebedee , and john his brother , in a ship with zebedee their father , mending their nets ; and he called them .
and they straightway left their nets , and followed him .
and jesus went about all galilee , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the gospel of the kingdom , and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people .
and they immediately left the ship and their father , and followed him .
and there followed him great multitudes of people from galilee , and from decapolis , and from jerusalem , and from judaea , and from beyond jordan .
see , for that the lord hath given you the sabbath , therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days ; abide ye every man in his place , let no man go out of his place on the seventh day .
and it came to pass , that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather , and they found none .
and the lord said unto moses , how long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws ?
six days ye shall gather it ; but on the seventh day , which is the sabbath , in it there shall be none .
and moses said , eat that to day ; for to day is a sabbath unto the lord : to day ye shall not find it in the field .
and they laid it up till the morning , as moses bade : and it did not stink , neither was there any worm therein .
and he said unto them , this is that which the lord hath said , to morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the lord : bake that which ye will bake to day , and seethe that ye will seethe ; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning .
and it came to pass , that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread , two omers for one man : and all the rulers of the congregation came and told moses .
and they gathered it every morning , every man according to his eating : and when the sun waxed hot , it melted .
notwithstanding they hearkened not unto moses ; but some of them left of it until the morning , and it bred worms , and stank : and moses was wroth with them .
which also they did , and sent it to the elders by the hands of barnabas and saul .
now benjamin begat bela his firstborn , ashbel the second , and aharah the third ,
nohah the fourth , and rapha the fifth .
and the sons of bela were , addar , and gera , and abihud ,
and abishua , and naaman , and ahoah ,
and the lord shall bring thee into egypt again with ships , by the way whereof i spake unto thee , thou shalt see it no more again : and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen , and no man shall buy you .
and these are the sons of ehud : these are the heads of the fathers of the inhabitants of geba , and they removed them to manahath :
and thy life shall hang in doubt before thee ; and thou shalt fear day and night , and shalt have none assurance of thy life :
and naaman , and ahiah , and gera , he removed them , and begat uzza , and ahihud .
in the morning thou shalt say , would god it were even ! and at even thou shalt say , would god it were morning ! for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear , and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see .
and shaharaim begat children in the country of moab , after he had sent them away ; hushim and baara were his wives .
and the lord shall scatter thee among all people , from the one end of the earth even unto the other ; and there thou shalt serve other gods , which neither thou nor thy fathers have known , even wood and stone .
and he begat of hodesh his wife , jobab , and zibia , and mesha , and malcham ,
and among these nations shalt thou find no ease , neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest : but the lord shall give thee there a trembling heart , and failing of eyes , and sorrow of mind :
also every sickness , and every plague , which is not written in the book of this law , them will the lord bring upon thee , until thou be destroyed .
moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of egypt , which thou wast afraid of ; and they shall cleave unto thee .
and it shall come to pass , that as the lord rejoiced over you to do you good , and to multiply you ; so the lord will rejoice over you to destroy you , and to bring you to nought ; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it .
then nebuzar - adan the captain of the guard carried away captive into babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city , and those that fell away , that fell to him , with the rest of the people that remained .
and ye shall be left few in number , whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude ; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the lord thy god .
moreover he put out zedekiah ' s eyes , and bound him with chains , to carry him to babylon .
and the chaldeans burned the king ' s house , and the houses of the people , with fire , and brake down the walls of jerusalem .
but the chaldeans ' army pursued after them , and overtook zedekiah in the plains of jericho : and when they had taken him , they brought him up to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon to riblah in the land of hamath , where he gave judgment upon him .
then the king of babylon slew the sons of zedekiah in riblah before his eyes : also the king of babylon slew all the nobles of judah .
this is the thing which the lord hath commanded , gather of it every man according to his eating , an omer for every man , according to the number of your persons ; take ye every man for them which are in his tents .
and the children of israel did so , and gathered , some more , some less .
and when they did mete it with an omer , he that gathered much had nothing over , and he that gathered little had no lack ; they gathered every man according to his eating .
and moses said , let no man leave of it till the morning .
then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in jerusalem : and they sent forth barnabas , that he should go as far as antioch .
and samson said unto them , though ye have done this , yet will i be avenged of you , and after that i will cease .
and it came to pass , that at even the quails came up , and covered the camp : and in the morning the dew lay round about the host .
who , when he came , and had seen the grace of god , was glad , and exhorted them all , that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the lord .
i have heard the murmurings of the children of israel : speak unto them , saying , at even ye shall eat flesh , and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread ; and ye shall know that i am the lord your god .
and some of them were men of cyprus and cyrene , which , when they were come to antioch , spake unto the grecians , preaching the lord jesus .
and when he had set the brands on fire , he let them go into the standing corn of the philistines , and burnt up both the shocks , and also the standing corn , with the vineyards and olives .
and when the children of israel saw it , they said one to another , it is manna : for they wist not what it was . and moses said unto them , this is the bread which the lord hath given you to eat .
and the hand of the lord was with them : and a great number believed , and turned unto the lord .
then the philistines said , who hath done this ? and they answered , samson , the son in law of the timnite , because he had taken his wife , and given her to his companion . and the philistines came up , and burnt her and her father with fire .
and when the dew that lay was gone up , behold , upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing , as small as the hoar frost on the ground .
then the philistines went up , and pitched in judah , and spread themselves in lehi .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
and it came to pass , as aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of israel , that they looked toward the wilderness , and , behold , the glory of the lord appeared in the cloud .
and toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet , and toward her children which she shall bear : for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege and straitness , wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates .
if thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book , that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name , the lord thy god ;
and all the princes of the king of babylon came in , and sat in the middle gate , even nergal - sharezer , samgar - nebo , sarsechim , rab - saris , nergal - sharezer , rabmag , with all the residue of the princes of the king of babylon .
and there stood up one of them named agabus , and signified by the spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world : which came to pass in the days of claudius caesar .
then the lord will make thy plagues wonderful , and the plagues of thy seed , even great plagues , and of long continuance , and sore sicknesses , and of long continuance .
and in the eleventh year of zedekiah , in the fourth month , the ninth day of the month , the city was broken up .
then the disciples , every man according to his ability , determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in judaea :
in the ninth year of zedekiah king of judah , in the tenth month , came nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and all his army against jerusalem , and they beseiged it .
and when he had found him , he brought him unto antioch . and it came to pass , that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church , and taught much people . and the disciples were called christians first in antioch .
and samson said concerning them , now shall i be more blameless than the philistines , though i do them a displeasure .
and thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body , the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters , which the lord thy god hath given thee , in the siege , and in the straitness , wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee :
and in these days came prophets from jerusalem unto antioch .
and samson went and caught three hundred foxes , and took firebrands , and turned tail to tail , and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails .
so that the man that is tender among you , and very delicate , his eye shall be evil toward his brother , and toward the wife of his bosom , and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave :
for he was a good man , and full of the holy ghost and of faith : and much people was added unto the lord .
but it came to pass within a while after , in the time of wheat harvest , that samson visited his wife with a kid ; and he said , i will go in to my wife into the chamber . but her father would not suffer him to go in .
so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat : because he hath nothing left him in the siege , and in the straitness , wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates .
then departed barnabas to tarsus , for to seek saul :
and her father said , i verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her ; therefore i gave her to thy companion : is not her younger sister fairer than she ? take her , i pray thee , instead of her .
the tender and delicate woman among you , which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness , her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom , and toward her son , and toward her daughter ,
and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates , until thy high and fenced walls come down , wherein thou trustedst , throughout all thy land : and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land , which the lord thy god hath given thee .
and he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle , and the fruit of thy land , until thou be destroyed : which also shall not leave thee either corn , wine , or oil , or the increase of thy kine , or flocks of thy sheep , until he have destroyed thee .
a nation of fierce countenance , which shall not regard the person of the old , nor shew favour to the young :
and this was done three times : and all were drawn up again into heaven .
i will greatly praise the lord with my mouth ; yea , i will praise him among the multitude .
and , behold , immediately there were three men already come unto the house where i was , sent from caesarea unto me .
for he shall stand at the right hand of the poor , to save him from those that condemn his soul .
and the spirit bade me go with them , nothing doubting . moreover these six brethren accompanied me , and we entered into the man ' s house :
and he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house , which stood and said unto him , send men to joppa , and call for simon , whose surname is peter ;
he shall lend to thee , and thou shalt not lend to him : he shall be the head , and thou shalt be the tail .
who shall tell thee words , whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved .
moreover all these curses shall come upon thee , and shall pursue thee , and overtake thee , till thou be destroyed ; because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the lord thy god , to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee :
and as i began to speak , the holy ghost fell on them , as on us at the beginning .
all thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust consume .
then remembered i the word of the lord , how that he said , john indeed baptized with water ; but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost .
the stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very high ; and thou shalt come down very low .
forasmuch then as god gave them the like gift as he did unto us , who believed on the lord jesus christ ; what was i , that i could withstand god ?
therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the lord shall send against thee , in hunger , and in thirst , and in nakedness , and in want of all things : and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck , until he have destroyed thee .
when they heard these things , they held their peace , and glorified god , saying , then hath god also to the gentiles granted repentance unto life .
the lord shall bring a nation against thee from far , from the end of the earth , as swift as the eagle flieth ; a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand ;
now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about stephen travelled as far as phenice , and cyprus , and antioch , preaching the word to none but unto the jews only .
and they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder , and upon thy seed for ever .
because thou servedst not the lord thy god with joyfulness , and with gladness of heart , for the abundance of all things ;
and the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved , that goeth down sweetly , causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak .
i said , i will go up to the palm tree , i will take hold of the boughs thereof : now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine , and the smell of thy nose like apples ;
this thy stature is like to a palm tree , and thy breasts to clusters of grapes .
thou shalt beget sons and daughters , but thou shalt not enjoy them ; for they shall go into captivity .
thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts , but thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil ; for thine olive shall cast his fruit .
i became also a reproach unto them : when they looked upon me they shaked their heads .
thy navel is like a round goblet , which wanteth not liquor : thy belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies .
my knees are weak through fasting ; and my flesh faileth of fatness .
how beautiful are thy feet with shoes , o prince ' s daughter ! the joints of thy thighs are like jewels , the work of the hands of a cunning workman .
i am gone like the shadow when it declineth : i am tossed up and down as the locust .
for i am poor and needy , and my heart is wounded within me .
let mine adversaries be clothed with shame , and let them cover themselves with their own confusion , as with a mantle .
how fair and how pleasant art thou , o love , for delights !
let them curse , but bless thou : when they arise , let them be ashamed ; but let thy servant rejoice .
thine head upon thee is like carmel , and the hair of thine head like purple ; the king is held in the galleries .
that they may know that this is thy hand ; that thou , lord , hast done it .
thy neck is as a tower of ivory ; thine eyes like the fishpools in heshbon , by the gate of bath - rabbim : thy nose is as the tower of lebanon which looketh toward damascus .
help me , o lord my god : o save me according to thy mercy :
thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins .
i pray for them : i pray not for the world , but for them which thou hast given me ; for they are thine .
and the house of israel called the name thereof manna : and it was like coriander seed , white ; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey .
thou shalt plant vineyards , and dress them , but shalt neither drink of the wine , nor gather the grapes ; for the worms shall eat them .
so the people rested on the seventh day .
and moses said unto aaron , take a pot , and put an omer full of manna therein , and lay it up before the lord , to be kept for your generations .
and moses said , this is the thing which the lord commandeth , fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations ; that they may see the bread wherewith i have fed you in the wilderness , when i brought you forth from the land of egypt .
and the children of israel did eat manna forty years , until they came to a land inhabited ; they did eat manna , until they came unto the borders of the land of canaan .
let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the lord , and of them that speak evil against my soul .
as the lord commanded moses , so aaron laid it up before the testimony , to be kept .
but do thou for me , o god the lord , for thy name ' s sake : because thy mercy is good , deliver thou me .
now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah .
these words spake jesus , and lifted up his eyes to heaven , and said , father , the hour is come ; glorify thy son , that thy son also may glorify thee :
thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes , and thou shalt not eat thereof : thine ass shall be violently taken away from before thy face , and shall not be restored to thee : thy sheep shall be given unto thine enemies , and thou shalt have none to rescue them .
as thou hast given him power over all flesh , that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him .
thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people , and thine eyes shall look , and fail with longing for them all the day long : and there shall be no might in thine hand .
and this is life eternal , that they might know thee the only true god , and jesus christ , whom thou hast sent .
the fruit of thy land , and all thy labours , shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up ; and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed alway :
i have glorified thee on the earth : i have finished the work which thou gavest me to do .
so that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see .
and now , o father , glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which i had with thee before the world was .
the lord shall smite thee in the knees , and in the legs , with a sore botch that cannot be healed , from the sole of thy foot unto the top of thy head .
i have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world : thine they were , and thou gavest them me ; and they have kept thy word .
the lord shall bring thee , and thy king which thou shalt set over thee , unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers have known ; and there shalt thou serve other gods , wood and stone .
now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee .
and thou shalt become an astonishment , a proverb , and a byword , among all nations whither the lord shall lead thee .
for i have given unto them the words which thou gavest me ; and they have received them , and have known surely that i came out from thee , and they have believed that thou didst send me .
thou shalt carry much seed out into the field , and shalt gather but little in ; for the locust shall consume it .
deliver me , i pray thee , from the hand of my brother , from the hand of esau : for i fear him , lest he will come and smite me , and the mother with the children .
therefore my people shall know my name : therefore they shall know in that day that i am he that doth speak : behold , it is i .
i am not worthy of the least of all the mercies , and of all the truth , which thou hast shewed unto thy servant ; for with my staff i passed over this jordan ; and now i am become two bands .
how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings , that publisheth peace ; that bringeth good tidings of good , that publisheth salvation ; that saith unto zion , thy god reigneth !
and he lodged there that same night ; and took of that which came to his hand a present for esau his brother ;
thy watchmen shall lift up the voice ; with the voice together shall they sing : for they shall see eye to eye , when the lord shall bring again zion .
and thou saidst , i will surely do thee good , and make thy seed as the sand of the sea , which cannot be numbered for multitude .
and he called his ten servants , and delivered them ten pounds , and said unto them , occupy till i come .
and so commanded he the second , and the third , and all that followed the droves , saying , on this manner shall ye speak unto esau , when ye find him .
let his children be continually vagabonds , and beg : let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places .
but his citizens hated him , and sent a message after him , saying , we will not have this man to reign over us .
then thou shalt say , they be thy servant jacob ' s ; it is a present sent unto my lord esau : and , behold , also he is behind us .
and it came to pass , that when he was returned , having received the kingdom , then he commanded these servants to be called unto him , to whom he had given the money , that he might know how much every man had gained by trading .
then came the first , saying , lord , thy pound hath gained ten pounds .
awake , awake ; put on thy strength , o zion ; put on thy beautiful garments , o jerusalem , the holy city : for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean .
and he said unto him , well , thou good servant : because thou hast been faithful in a very little , have thou authority over ten cities .
thirty milch camels with their colts , forty kine , and ten bulls , twenty she asses , and ten foals .
shake thyself from the dust ; arise , and sit down , o jerusalem : loose thyself from the bands of thy neck , o captive daughter of zion .
and the second came , saying , lord , thy pound hath gained five pounds .
two hundred she goats , and twenty he goats , two hundred ewes , and twenty rams ,
for thus saith the lord , ye have sold yourselves for nought ; and ye shall be redeemed without money .
and he said likewise to him , be thou also over five cities .
and he commanded the foremost , saying , when esau my brother meeteth thee , and asketh thee , saying , whose art thou ? and whither goest thou ? and whose are these before thee ?
for thus saith the lord god , my people went down aforetime into egypt to sojourn there ; and the assyrian oppressed them without cause .
and he delivered them into the hand of his servants , every drove by themselves ; and said unto his servants , pass over before me , and put a space betwixt drove and drove .
now therefore , what have i here , saith the lord , that my people is taken away for nought ? they that rule over them make them to howl , saith the lord ; and my name continually every day is blasphemed .
as he loved cursing , so let it come unto him : as he delighted not in blessing , so let it be far from him .
as he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment , so let it come into his bowels like water , and like oil into his bones .
let them be before the lord continually , that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth .
because that he remembered not to shew mercy , but persecuted the poor and needy man , that he might even slay the broken in heart .
for the son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost .
let his posterity be cut off ; and in the generation following let their name be blotted out .
let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the lord ; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out .
let the extortioner catch all that he hath ; and let the strangers spoil his labour .
and as they heard these things , he added and spake a parable , because he was nigh to jerusalem , and because they thought that the kingdom of god should immediately appear .
let there be none to extend mercy unto him : neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children .
let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him , and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually .
and jacob was left alone ; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day .
and he took them , and sent them over the brook , and sent over that he had .
and he rose up that night , and took his two wives , and his two womenservants , and his eleven sons , and passed over the ford jabbok .
so went the present over before him : and himself lodged that night in the company .
and say ye moreover , behold , thy servant jacob is behind us . for he said , i will appease him with the present that goeth before me , and afterward i will see his face ; peradventure he will accept of me .
for i say unto you , that unto every one which hath shall be given ; and from him that hath not , even that he hath shall be taken away from him .
but those mine enemies , which would not that i should reign over them , bring hither , and slay them before me .
and he said unto them that stood by , take from him the pound , and give it to him that hath ten pounds .
( and they said unto him , lord , he hath ten pounds . )
and jacob asked him , and said , tell me , i pray thee , thy name . and he said , wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name ? and he blessed him there .
and he said , thy name shall be called no more jacob , but israel : for as a prince hast thou power with god and with men , and hast prevailed .
and he said unto him , what is thy name ? and he said , jacob .
and when he had thus spoken , he went before , ascending up to jerusalem .
and he said , let me go , for the day breaketh . and he said , i will not let thee go , except thou bless me .
and it came to pass , when he was come nigh to bethphage and bethany , at the mount called the mount of olives , he sent two of his disciples ,
and when he saw that he prevailed not against him , he touched the hollow of his thigh ; and the hollow of jacob ' s thigh was out of joint , as he wrestled with him .
wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank , that at my coming i might have required mine own with usury ?
and he saith unto him , out of thine own mouth will i judge thee , thou wicked servant . thou knewest that i was an austere man , taking up that i laid not down , and reaping that i did not sow :
for i feared thee , because thou art an austere man : thou takest up that thou layedst not down , and reapest that thou didst not sow .
and another came , saying , lord , behold , here is thy pound , which i have kept laid up in a napkin :
was not abraham our father justified by works , when he had offered isaac his son upon the altar ?
but wilt thou know , o vain man , that faith without works is dead ?
and jesus took the loaves ; and when he had given thanks , he distributed to the disciples , and the disciples to them that were set down ; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would .
and jesus said , make the men sit down . now there was much grass in the place . so the men sat down , in number about five thousand .
and some of the pharisees from among the multitude said unto him , master , rebuke thy disciples .
and they brought him to jesus : and they cast their garments upon the colt , and they set jesus thereon .
and as he went , they spread their clothes in the way .
and when he was come nigh , even now at the descent of the mount of olives , the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise god with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen ;
saying , blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the lord : peace in heaven , and glory in the highest .
and they that were sent went their way , and found even as he had said unto them .
and if any man ask you , why do ye loose him ? thus shall ye say unto him , because the lord hath need of him .
and they said , the lord hath need of him .
and as they were loosing the colt , the owners thereof said unto them , why loose ye the colt ?
thou believest that there is one god ; thou doest well : the devils also believe , and tremble .
even so faith , if it hath not works , is dead , being alone .
and when even was now come , his disciples went down unto the sea ,
yea , a man may say , thou hast faith , and i have works : shew me thy faith without thy works , and i will shew thee my faith by my works .
and entered into a ship , and went over the sea toward capernaum . and it was now dark , and jesus was not come to them .
if a brother or sister be naked , and destitute of daily food ,
and the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew .
and one of you say unto them , depart in peace , be ye warmed and filled ; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body ; what doth it profit ?
so when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs , they see jesus walking on the sea , and drawing nigh unto the ship : and they were afraid .
for he shall have judgment without mercy , that hath shewed no mercy ; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment .
when they were filled , he said unto his disciples , gather up the fragments that remain , that nothing be lost .
what doth it profit , my brethren , though a man say he hath faith , and have not works ? can faith save him ?
for he that said , do not commit adultery , said also , do not kill . now if thou commit no adultery , yet if thou kill , thou art become a transgressor of the law .
then those men , when they had seen the miracle that jesus did , said , this is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world .
so speak ye , and so do , as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty .
when jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force , to make him a king , he departed again into a mountain himself alone .
the day following , when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there , save that one whereinto his disciples were entered , and that jesus went not with his disciples into the boat , but that his disciples were gone away alone ;
then they willingly received him into the ship : and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went .
for whosoever shall keep the whole law , and yet offend in one point , he is guilty of all .
but he saith unto them , it is i ; be not afraid .
and could not find what they might do : for all the people were very attentive to hear him .
saying unto them , it is written , my house is the house of prayer : but ye have made it a den of thieves .
and he taught daily in the temple . but the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him ,
and he went into the temple , and began to cast out them that sold therein , and them that bought ;
for the days shall come upon thee , that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee , and compass thee round , and keep thee in on every side ,
and when he had opened the fourth seal , i heard the voice of the fourth beast say , come and see .
saying , if thou hadst known , even thou , at least in this thy day , the things which belong unto thy peace ! but now they are hid from thine eyes .
and when he was come near , he beheld the city , and wept over it ,
and he answered and said unto them , i tell you that , if these should hold their peace , the stones would immediately cry out .
and i saw , and behold a white horse : and he that sat on him had a bow ; and a crown was given unto him : and he went forth conquering , and to conquer .
jesus answered and said unto them , this is the work of god , that ye believe on him whom he hath sent .
and i saw when the lamb opened one of the seals , and i heard , as it were the noise of thunder , one of the four beasts saying , come and see .
labour not for the meat which perisheth , but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life , which the son of man shall give unto you : for him hath god the father sealed .
then said they unto him , what shall we do , that we might work the works of god ?
and i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say , a measure of wheat for a penny , and three measures of barley for a penny ; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine .
and when they had found him on the other side of the sea , they said unto him , rabbi , when camest thou hither ?
and when he had opened the third seal , i heard the third beast say , come and see . and i beheld , and lo a black horse ; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand .
jesus answered them and said , verily , verily , i say unto you , ye seek me , not because ye saw the miracles , but because ye did eat of the loaves , and were filled .
and there went out another horse that was red : and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth , and that they should kill one another : and there was given unto him a great sword .
( howbeit there came other boats from tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread , after that the lord had given thanks : )
they said therefore unto him , what sign shewest thou then , that we may see , and believe thee ? what dost thou work ?
our fathers did eat manna in the desert ; as it is written , he gave them bread from heaven to eat .
then jesus said unto them , verily , verily , i say unto you , moses gave you not that bread from heaven ; but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven .
for the bread of god is he which cometh down from heaven , and giveth life unto the world .
and jesus said unto them , i am the bread of life : he that cometh to me shall never hunger ; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst .
then said they unto him , lord , evermore give us this bread .
all that the father giveth me shall come to me ; and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out .
but i said unto you , that ye also have seen me , and believe not .
and this is the father ' s will which hath sent me , that of all which he hath given me i should lose nothing , but should raise it up again at the last day .
for i came down from heaven , not to do mine own will , but the will of him that sent me .
now therefore , behold , the cry of the children of israel is come unto me : and i have also seen the oppression wherewith the egyptians oppress them .
and i will make of thee a great nation , and i will bless thee , and make thy name great ; and thou shalt be a blessing :
and this is the will of him that sent me , that every one which seeth the son , and believeth on him , may have everlasting life : and i will raise him up at the last day .
now the lord had said unto abram , get thee out of thy country , and from thy kindred , and from thy father ' s house , unto a land that i will shew thee :
jesus therefore answered and said unto them , murmur not among yourselves .
no man can come to me , except the father which hath sent me draw him : and i will raise him up at the last day .
and they said , is not this jesus , the son of joseph , whose father and mother we know ? how is it then that he saith , i came down from heaven ?
and the scripture was fulfilled which saith , abraham believed god , and it was imputed unto him for righteousness : and he was called the friend of god .
i am that bread of life .
and abram journeyed , going on still toward the south .
seest thou how faith wrought with his works , and by works was faith made perfect ?
verily , verily , i say unto you , he that believeth on me hath everlasting life .
likewise also was not rahab the harlot justified by works , when she had received the messengers , and had sent them out another way ?
not that any man hath seen the father , save he which is of god , he hath seen the father .
and the lord appeared unto abram , and said , unto thy seed will i give this land : and there builded he an altar unto the lord , who appeared unto him .
ye see then how that by works a man is justified , and not by faith only .
it is written in the prophets , and they shall be all taught of god . every man therefore that hath heard , and hath learned of the father , cometh unto me .
and he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of bethel , and pitched his tent , having bethel on the west , and hai on the east : and there he builded an altar unto the lord , and called upon the name of the lord .
and abram took sarai his wife , and lot his brother ' s son , and all their substance that they had gathered , and the souls that they had gotten in haran ; and they went forth to go into the land of canaan ; and into the land of canaan they came .
for as the body without the spirit is dead , so faith without works is dead also .
and abram passed through the land unto the place of sichem , unto the plain of moreh . and the canaanite was then in the land .
and i will bless them that bless thee , and curse him that curseth thee : and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed .
your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness , and are dead .
so abram departed , as the lord had spoken unto him ; and lot went with him : and abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of haran .
the jews therefore strove among themselves , saying , how can this man give us his flesh to eat ?
whoso eateth my flesh , and drinketh my blood , hath eternal life ; and i will raise him up at the last day .
and jacob called the name of the place peniel : for i have seen god face to face , and my life is preserved .
and as he passed over penuel the sun rose upon him , and he halted upon his thigh .
therefore the children of israel eat not of the sinew which shrank , which is upon the hollow of the thigh , unto this day : because he touched the hollow of jacob ' s thigh in the sinew that shrank .
this is the bread which cometh down from heaven , that a man may eat thereof , and not die .
i am the living bread which came down from heaven : if any man eat of this bread , he shall live for ever : and the bread that i will give is my flesh , which i will give for the life of the world .
as the living father hath sent me , and i live by the father : so he that eateth me , even he shall live by me .
he that eateth my flesh , and drinketh my blood , dwelleth in me , and i in him .
these things said he in the synagogue , as he taught in capernaum .
this is that bread which came down from heaven : not as your fathers did eat manna , and are dead : he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever .
and the lord said , i have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in egypt , and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters ; for i know their sorrows ;
and he said , draw not nigh hither : put off thy shoes from off thy feet , for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground .
moreover he said , i am the god of thy father , the god of abraham , the god of isaac , and the god of jacob . and moses hid his face ; for he was afraid to look upon god .
and moses said , i will now turn aside , and see this great sight , why the bush is not burnt .
and when the lord saw that he turned aside to see , god called unto him out of the midst of the bush , and said , moses , moses . and he said , here am i .
and the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush : and he looked , and , behold , the bush burned with fire , and the bush was not consumed .
and he said , therefore said i unto you , that no man can come unto me , except it were given unto him of my father .
from that time many of his disciples went back , and walked no more with him .
it is the spirit that quickeneth ; the flesh profiteth nothing : the words that i speak unto you , they are spirit , and they are life .
but there are some of you that believe not . for jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not , and who should betray him .
when jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it , he said unto them , doth this offend you ?
what and if ye shall see the son of man ascend up where he was before ?
many therefore of his disciples , when they had heard this , said , this is an hard saying ; who can hear it ?
and we believe and are sure that thou art that christ , the son of the living god .
then simon peter answered him , lord , to whom shall we go ? thou hast the words of eternal life .
then said jesus unto the twelve , will ye also go away ?
behold , i have made thee small among the heathen : thou art greatly despised .
the vision of obadiah . thus saith the lord god concerning edom ; we have heard a rumour from the lord , and an ambassador is sent among the heathen , arise ye , and let us rise up against her in battle .
though thou exalt thyself as the eagle , and though thou set thy nest among the stars , thence will i bring thee down , saith the lord .
the pride of thine heart hath deceived thee , thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock , whose habitation is high ; that saith in his heart , who shall bring me down to the ground ?
how are the things of esau searched out ! how are his hidden things sought up !
if thieves came to thee , if robbers by night , ( how art thou cut off ! ) would they not have stolen till they had enough ? if the grapegatherers came to thee , would they not leave some grapes ?
shall i not in that day , saith the lord , even destroy the wise men out of edom , and understanding out of the mount of esau ?
all the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the border : the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee , and prevailed against thee ; they that eat thy bread have laid a wound under thee : there is none understanding in him .
and thy mighty men , o teman , shall be dismayed , to the end that every one of the mount of esau may be cut off by slaughter .
see , i have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms , to root out , and to pull down , and to destroy , and to throw down , to build , and to plant .
and the lord spake unto moses and to aaron , saying ,
speak unto the children of israel , and say unto them , when any man hath a running issue out of his flesh , because of his issue he is unclean .
and this shall be his uncleanness in his issue : whether his flesh run with his issue , or his flesh be stopped from his issue , it is his uncleanness .
and they shall fight against thee ; but they shall not prevail against thee ; for i am with thee , saith the lord , to deliver thee .
every bed , whereon he lieth that hath the issue , is unclean : and every thing , whereon he sitteth , shall be unclean .
and what saddle soever he rideth upon that hath the issue shall be unclean .
and the word of the lord came unto me the second time , saying , what seest thou ? and i said , i see a seething pot ; and the face thereof is toward the north .
then the lord said unto me , out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land .
moreover the word of the lord came unto me , saying , jeremiah , what seest thou ? and i said , i see a rod of an almond tree .
then said the lord unto me , thou hast well seen : for i will hasten my word to perform it .
and whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
thou therefore gird up thy loins , and arise , and speak unto them all that i command thee : be not dismayed at their faces , lest i confound thee before them .
and he that sitteth on any thing whereon he sat that hath the issue shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
for , behold , i have made thee this day a defenced city , and an iron pillar , and brasen walls against the whole land , against the kings of judah , against the princes thereof , against the priests thereof , and against the people of the land .
and he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
for , lo , i will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north , saith the lord ; and they shall come , and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of jerusalem , and against all the walls thereof round about , and against all the cities of judah .
and if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean ; then he shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
and i will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness , who have forsaken me , and have burned incense unto other gods , and worshipped the works of their own hands .
and they took him , and killed him , and cast him out of the vineyard .
but those husbandmen said among themselves , this is the heir ; come , let us kill him , and the inheritance shall be ours .
and again he sent another ; and him they killed , and many others ; beating some , and killing some .
and again he sent unto them another servant ; and at him they cast stones , and wounded him in the head , and sent him away shamefully handled .
and they caught him , and beat him , and sent him away empty .
and at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant , that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard .
and he began to speak unto them by parables . a certain man planted a vineyard , and set an hedge about it , and digged a place for the winefat , and built a tower , and let it out to husbandmen , and went into a far country .
what shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do ? he will come and destroy the husbandmen , and will give the vineyard unto others .
behold , the day of the lord cometh , cruel both with wrath and fierce anger , to lay the land desolate : and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it .
the burden of babylon , which isaiah the son of amoz did see .
lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain , exalt the voice unto them , shake the hand , that they may go into the gates of the nobles .
i have commanded my sanctified ones , i have also called my mighty ones for mine anger , even them that rejoice in my highness .
the noise of a multitude in the mountains , like as of a great people ; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together : the lord of hosts mustereth the host of the battle .
they come from a far country , from the end of heaven , even the lord , and the weapons of his indignation , to destroy the whole land .
howl ye ; for the day of the lord is at hand ; it shall come as a destruction from the almighty .
therefore shall all hands be faint , and every man ' s heart shall melt :
and they shall be afraid : pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them ; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth : they shall be amazed one at another ; their faces shall be as flames .
neither is it beyond the sea , that thou shouldest say , who shall go over the sea for us , and bring it unto us , that we may hear it , and do it ?
it is not in heaven , that thou shouldest say , who shall go up for us to heaven , and bring it unto us , that we may hear it , and do it ?
see , i have set before thee this day life and good , and death and evil ;
but the word is very nigh unto thee , in thy mouth , and in thy heart , that thou mayest do it .
for this commandment which i command thee this day , it is not hidden from thee , neither is it far off .
if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god , to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law , and if thou turn unto the lord thy god with all thine heart , and with all thy soul .
and i say unto you , make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness ; that , when ye fail , they may receive you into everlasting habitations .
in that i command thee this day to love the lord thy god , to walk in his ways , and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments , that thou mayest live and multiply : and the lord thy god shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it .
but if thine heart turn away , so that thou wilt not hear , but shalt be drawn away , and worship other gods , and serve them ;
i denounce unto you this day , that ye shall surely perish , and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land , whither thou passest over jordan to go to possess it .
i call heaven and earth to record this day against you , that i have set before you life and death , blessing and cursing : therefore choose life , that both thou and thy seed may live :
so he called every one of his lord ' s debtors unto him , and said unto the first , how much owest thou unto my lord ?
and he said , an hundred measures of oil . and he said unto him , take thy bill , and sit down quickly , and write fifty .
then said he to another , and how much owest thou ? and he said , an hundred measures of wheat . and he said unto him , take thy bill , and write fourscore .
and the lord commended the unjust steward , because he had done wisely : for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light .
and he said also unto his disciples , there was a certain rich man , which had a steward ; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods .
and he called him , and said unto him , how is it that i hear this of thee ? give an account of thy stewardship ; for thou mayest be no longer steward .
i am resolved what to do , that , when i am put out of the stewardship , they may receive me into their houses .
which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets , saying , the land , unto which ye go to possess it , is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands , with their abominations , which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness .
now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons , neither take their daughters unto your sons , nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever : that ye may be strong , and eat the good of the land , and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever .
when i say unto the wicked , o wicked man , thou shalt surely die ; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way , that wicked man shall die in his iniquity ; but his blood will i require at thine hand .
and now , o our god , what shall we say after this ? for we have forsaken thy commandments ,
nevertheless , if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it ; if he do not turn from his way , he shall die in his iniquity ; but thou hast delivered thy soul .
o lord god of israel , thou art righteous : for we remain yet escaped , as it is this day : behold , we are before thee in our trespasses : for we cannot stand before thee because of this .
but if the watchman see the sword come , and blow not the trumpet , and the people be not warned ; if the sword come , and take any person from among them , he is taken away in his iniquity ; but his blood will i require at the watchman ' s hand .
so thou , o son of man , i have set thee a watchman unto the house of israel ; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth , and warn them from me .
and after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds , and for our great trespass , seeing that thou our god hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve , and hast given us such deliverance as this ;
then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet , and taketh not warning ; if the sword come , and take him away , his blood shall be upon his own head .
should we again break thy commandments , and join in affinity with the people of these abominations ? wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us , so that there should be no remnant nor escaping ?
he heard the sound of the trumpet , and took not warning ; his blood shall be upon him . but he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul .
if when he seeth the sword come upon the land , he blow the trumpet , and warn the people ;
the lord shall open unto thee his good treasure , the heaven to give the rain unto thy land in his season , and to bless all the work of thine hand : and thou shalt lend unto many nations , and thou shalt not borrow .
and all people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the lord ; and they shall be afraid of thee .
cursed shalt thou be in the city , and cursed shalt thou be in the field .
but it shall come to pass , if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god , to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which i command thee this day ; that all these curses shall come upon thee , and overtake thee :
and thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which i command thee this day , to the right hand , or to the left , to go after other gods to serve them .
and the lord shall make thee the head , and not the tail ; and thou shalt be above only , and thou shalt not be beneath ; if that thou hearken unto the commandments of the lord thy god , which i command thee this day , to observe and to do them :
cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in , and cursed shalt thou be when thou goest out .
cursed shall be the fruit of thy body , and the fruit of thy land , the increase of thy kine , and the flocks of thy sheep .
the foolishness of man perverteth his way : and his heart fretteth against the lord .
wealth maketh many friends ; but the poor is separated from his neighbour .
better is the poor that walketh in his integrity , than he that is perverse in his lips , and is a fool .
also , that the soul be without knowledge , it is not good ; and he that hasteth with his feet sinneth .
o that thou wert as my brother , that sucked the breasts of my mother ! when i should find thee without , i would kiss thee ; yea , i should not be despised .
all the brethren of the poor do hate him : how much more do his friends go far from him ? he pursueth them with words , yet they are wanting to him .
i would lead thee , and bring thee into my mother ' s house , who would instruct me : i would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate .
his left hand should be under my head , and his right hand should embrace me .
a false witness shall not be unpunished , and he that speaketh lies shall not escape .
i charge you , o daughters of jerusalem , that ye stir not up , nor awake my love , until he please .
many will intreat the favour of the prince : and every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts .
who is this that cometh up from the wilderness , leaning upon her beloved ? i raised thee up under the apple tree : there thy mother brought thee forth : there she brought thee forth that bare thee .
set me as a seal upon thine heart , as a seal upon thine arm : for love is strong as death ; jealousy is cruel as the grave : the coals thereof are coals of fire , which hath a most vehement flame .
many waters cannot quench love , neither can the floods drown it : if a man would give all the substance of his house for love , it would utterly be contemned .
we have a little sister , and she hath no breasts : what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for ?
if she be a wall , we will build upon her a palace of silver : and if she be a door , we will inclose her with boards of cedar .
the lord shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee , until he have consumed thee from off the land , whither thou goest to possess it .
the lord shall send upon thee cursing , vexation , and rebuke , in all that thou settest thine hand unto for to do , until thou be destroyed , and until thou perish quickly ; because of the wickedness of thy doings , whereby thou hast forsaken me .
and thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass , and the earth that is under thee shall be iron .
the lord shall smite thee with a consumption , and with a fever , and with an inflammation , and with an extreme burning , and with the sword , and with blasting , and with mildew ; and they shall pursue thee until thou perish .
the lord shall cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies : thou shalt go out one way against them , and flee seven ways before them : and shalt be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth .
the lord shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust : from heaven shall it come down upon thee , until thou be destroyed .
the lord will smite thee with the botch of egypt , and with the emerods , and with the scab , and with the itch , whereof thou canst not be healed .
and thy carcase shall be meat unto all fowls of the air , and unto the beasts of the earth , and no man shall fray them away .
therefore i write these things being absent , lest being present i should use sharpness , according to the power which the lord hath given me to edification , and not to destruction .
and thou shalt grope at noonday , as the blind gropeth in darkness , and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways : and thou shalt be only oppressed and spoiled evermore , and no man shall save thee .
the lord shall smite thee with madness , and blindness , and astonishment of heart :
and she said unto the men , i know that the lord hath given you the land , and that your terror is fallen upon us , and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you .
and before they were laid down , she came up unto them upon the roof ;
and it was told the king of jericho , saying , behold , there came men in hither to night of the children of israel to search out the country .
and the king of jericho sent unto rahab , saying , bring forth the men that are come to thee , which are entered into thine house : for they be come to search out all the country .
and joshua the son of nun sent out of shittim two men to spy secretly , saying , go view the land , even jericho . and they went , and came into an harlot ' s house , named rahab , and lodged there .
but she had brought them up to the roof of the house , and hid them with the stalks of flax , which she had laid in order upon the roof .
the grace of the lord jesus christ , and the love of god , and the communion of the holy ghost , be with you all . amen .
and the men pursued after them the way to jordan unto the fords : and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out , they shut the gate .
finally , brethren , farewell . be perfect , be of good comfort , be of one mind , live in peace ; and the god of love and peace shall be with you .
and the woman took the two men , and hid them , and said thus , there came men unto me , but i wist not whence they were :
greet one another with an holy kiss .
and it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate , when it was dark , that the men went out : whither the men went i wot not : pursue after them quickly ; for ye shall overtake them .
thou shalt betroth a wife , and another man shall lie with her : thou shalt build an house , and thou shalt not dwell therein : thou shalt plant a vineyard , and shalt not gather the grapes thereof .
his enemies will i clothe with shame : but upon himself shall his crown flourish .
thus saith the lord , he that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence : but he that goeth forth to the chaldeans shall live ; for he shall have his life for a prey , and shall live .
there will i make the horn of david to bud : i have ordained a lamp for mine anointed .
thus saith the lord , this city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of babylon ' s army , which shall take it .
then zedekiah the king said , behold , he is in your hand : for the king is not he that can do any thing against you .
then took they jeremiah , and cast him into the dungeon of malchiah the son of hammelech , that was in the court of the prison : and they let down jeremiah with cords . and in the dungeon there was no water , but mire : so jeremiah sunk in the mire .
my lord the king , these men have done evil in all that they have done to jeremiah the prophet , whom they have cast into the dungeon ; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is : for there is no more bread in the city .
ebed - melech went forth out of the king ' s house , and spake to the king , saying ,
who can understand his errors ? cleanse thou me from secret faults .
moreover by them is thy servant warned : and in keeping of them there is great reward .
more to be desired are they than gold , yea , than much fine gold : sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb .
let the words of my mouth , and the meditation of my heart , be acceptable in thy sight , o lord , my strength , and my redeemer .
keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins ; let them not have dominion over me : then shall i be upright , and i shall be innocent from the great transgression .
a false witness shall not be unpunished , and he that speaketh lies shall perish .
the lord hath sworn in truth unto david ; he will not turn from it ; of the fruit of thy body will i set upon thy throne .
if thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that i shall teach them , their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore .
for thy servant david ' s sake turn not away the face of thine anointed .
i will abundantly bless her provision : i will satisfy her poor with bread .
i will also clothe her priests with salvation : and her saints shall shout aloud for joy .
for the lord hath chosen zion ; he hath desired it for his habitation .
this is my rest for ever : here will i dwell ; for i have desired it .
as righteousness tendeth to life : so he that pursueth evil pursueth it to his own death .
the wicked worketh a deceitful work : but to him that soweth righteousness shall be a sure reward .
he that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it : and he that hateth suretiship is sure .
where no counsel is , the people fall : but in the multitude of counsellers there is safety .
the merciful man doeth good to his own soul : but he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh .
a gracious woman retaineth honour : and strong men retain riches .
by the blessing of the upright the city is exalted : but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked .
when it goeth well with the righteous , the city rejoiceth : and when the wicked perish , there is shouting .
a talebearer revealeth secrets : but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter .
he that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour : but a man of understanding holdeth his peace .
they that are of a froward heart are abomination to the lord : but such as are upright in their way are his delight .
he that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind : and the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart .
he that trusteth in his riches shall fall : but the righteous shall flourish as a branch .
he that diligently seeketh good procureth favour : but he that seeketh mischief , it shall come unto him .
he that withholdeth corn , the people shall curse him : but blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it .
the liberal soul shall be made fat : and he that watereth shall be watered also himself .
there is that scattereth , and yet increaseth ; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet , but it tendeth to poverty .
the desire of the righteous is only good : but the expectation of the wicked is wrath .
as a jewel of gold in a swine ' s snout , so is a fair woman which is without discretion .
though hand join in hand , the wicked shall not be unpunished : but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered .
therefore david inquired again of god ; and god said unto him , go not up after them ; turn away from them , and come upon them over against the mulberry trees .
the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life ; and he that winneth souls is wise .
and it shall be , when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees , that then thou shalt go out to battle : for god is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the philistines .
behold , the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth : much more the wicked and the sinner .
and when they had left their gods there , david gave a commandment , and they were burned with fire .
and the philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley .
david therefore did as god commanded him : and they smote the host of the philistines from gibeon even to gazer .
and the fame of david went out into all lands ; and the lord brought the fear of him upon all nations .
and david inquired of god , saying , shall i go up against the philistines ? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand ? and the lord said unto him , go up ; for i will deliver them into thine hand .
so they came up to baal - perazim ; and david smote them there . then david said , god hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters : therefore they called the name of that place baal - perazim .
the beginning of the word of the lord by hosea . and the lord said to hosea , go , take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms : for the land hath committed great whoredom , departing from the lord .
the word of the lord that came unto hosea , the son of beeri , in the days of uzziah , jotham , ahaz , and hezekiah , kings of judah , and in the days of jeroboam the son of joash , king of israel .
jesus saith unto them , bring of the fish which ye have now caught .
jesus then cometh , and taketh bread , and giveth them , and fish likewise .
this is now the third time that jesus shewed himself to his disciples , after that he was risen from the dead .
then said god , call his name lo - ammi : for ye are not my people , and i will not be your god .
simon peter went up , and drew the net to land full of great fishes , and hundred and fifty and three : and for all there were so many , yet was not the net broken .
now when she had weaned lo - ruhamah , she conceived , and bare a son .
jesus saith unto them , come and dine . and none of the disciples durst ask him , who art thou ? knowing that it was the lord .
but i will have mercy upon the house of judah , and will save them by the lord their god , and will not save them by bow , nor by sword , nor by battle , by horses , nor by horsemen .
verily , verily , i say unto thee , when thou wast young , thou girdedst thyself , and walkedst whither thou wouldest : but when thou shalt be old , thou shalt stretch forth thy hands , and another shall gird thee , and carry thee whither thou wouldest not .
and it shall come to pass at that day , that i will break the bow of israel in the valley of jezreel .
so when they had dined , jesus saith to simon peter , simon , son of jonas , lovest thou me more than these ? he saith unto him , yea , lord ; thou knowest that i love thee . he saith unto him , feed my lambs .
and the lord said unto him , call his name jezreel ; for yet a little while , and i will avenge the blood of jezreel upon the house of jehu , and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of israel .
he saith to him again the second time , simon , son of jonas , lovest thou me ? he saith unto him , yea , lord ; thou knowest that i love thee . he saith unto him , feed my sheep .
so he went and took gomer the daughter of diblaim ; which conceived , and bare him a son .
then peter , turning about , seeth the disciple whom jesus loved following ; which also leaned on his breast at supper , and said , lord , which is he that betrayeth thee ?
jesus saith unto him , if i will that he tarry till i come , what is that to thee ? follow thou me .
this is the disciple which testifieth of these things , and wrote these things : and we know that his testimony is true .
and there are also many other things which jesus did , the which , if they should be written every one , i suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written . amen .
this spake he , signifying by what death he should glorify god . and when he had spoken this , he saith unto him , follow me .
god having provided some better thing for us , that they without us should not be made perfect .
be strong , and quit yourselves like men , o ye philistines , that ye be not servants unto the hebrews , as they have been to you : quit yourselves like men , and fight .
and the philistines were afraid , for they said , god is come into the camp . and they said , woe unto us ! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore .
woe unto us ! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods ? these are the gods that smote the egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness .
and when the ark of the covenant of the lord came into the camp , all israel shouted with a great shout , so that the earth rang again .
and when the philistines heard the noise of the shout , they said , what meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the hebrews ? and they understood that the ark of the lord was come into the camp .
then shalt thou call , and the lord shall answer ; thou shalt cry , and he shall say , here i am . if thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke , the putting forth of the finger , and speaking vanity ;
then shall thy light break forth as the morning , and thine health shall spring forth speedily : and thy righteousness shall go before thee ; the glory of the lord shall be thy rereward .
declare his glory among the heathen , his wonders among all people .
is not this the fast that i have chosen ? to loose the bands of wickedness , to undo the heavy burdens , and to let the oppressed go free , and that ye break every yoke ?
for the lord is great , and greatly to be praised : he is to be feared above all gods .
is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry , and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house ? when thou seest the naked , that thou cover him ; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh ?
o sing unto the lord a new song : sing unto the lord , all the earth .
behold , ye fast for strife and debate , and to smite with the fist of wickedness : ye shall not fast as ye do this day , to make your voice to be heard on high .
sing unto the lord , bless his name ; shew forth his salvation from day to day .
is it such a fast that i have chosen ? a day for a man to afflict his soul ? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush , and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him ? wilt thou call this a fast , and an acceptable day to the lord ?
yet they seek me daily , and delight to know my ways , as a nation that did righteousness , and forsook not the ordinance of their god : they ask of me the ordinances of justice ; they take delight in approaching to god .
wherefore have we fasted , say they , and thou seest not ? wherefore have we afflicted our soul , and thou takest no knowledge ? behold , in the day of your fast ye find pleasure , and exact all your labours .
cry aloud , spare not , lift up thy voice like a trumpet , and shew my people their transgression , and the house of jacob their sins .
by faith the walls of jericho fell down , after they were compassed about seven days .
by faith the harlot rahab perished not with them that believed not , when she had received the spies with peace .
( of whom the world was not worthy : ) they wandered in deserts , and in mountains , and in dens and caves of the earth .
and these all , having obtained a good report through faith , received not the promise :
and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings , yea , moreover of bonds and imprisonment :
they were stoned , they were sawn asunder , were tempted , were slain with the sword : they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins ; being destitute , afflicted , tormented ;
quenched the violence of fire , escaped the edge of the sword , out of weakness were made strong , waxed valiant in fight , turned to flight the armies of the aliens .
women received their dead raised to life again : and others were tortured , not accepting deliverance ; that they might obtain a better resurrection :
and what shall i more say ? for the time would fail me to tell of gedeon , and of barak , and of samson , and of jephthae ; of david also , and samuel , and of the prophets :
who through faith subdued kingdoms , wrought righteousness , obtained promises , stopped the mouths of lions ,
by faith they passed through the red sea as by dry land : which the egyptians assaying to do were drowned .
for he spake , and it was done ; he commanded , and it stood fast .
let all the earth fear the lord : let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him .
he gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap : he layeth up the depth in storehouses .
by the word of the lord were the heavens made ; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth .
he loveth righteousness and judgment : the earth is full of the goodness of the lord .
for the word of the lord is right ; and all his works are done in truth .
sing unto him a new song ; play skilfully with a loud noise .
praise the lord with harp : sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings .
and david said unto michal , it was before the lord , which chose me before thy father , and before all his house , to appoint me ruler over the people of the lord , over israel : therefore will i play before the lord .
hearken , o daughter , and consider , and incline thine ear ; forget also thine own people , and thy father ' s house ;
then david returned to bless his household . and michal the daughter of saul came out to meet david , and said , how glorious was the king of israel to day , who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants , as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself !
so shall the king greatly desire thy beauty : for he is thy lord ; and worship thou him .
therefore michal the daughter of saul had no child unto the day of her death .
and the daughter of tyre shall be there with a gift ; even the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour .
and i will yet be more vile than thus , and will be base in mine own sight : and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of , of them shall i be had in honour .
the king ' s daughter is all glorious within : her clothing is of wrought gold .
she shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework : the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee .
with gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought : they shall enter into the king ' s palace .
instead of thy fathers shall be thy children , whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth .
i will make thy name to be remembered in all generations : therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever .
and he made in jerusalem engines , invented by cunning men , to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks , to shoot arrows and great stones withal . and his name spread far abroad ; for he was marvellously helped , till he was strong .
and uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields , and spears , and helmets , and habergeons , and bows , and slings to cast stones .
and he dealt among all the people , even among the whole multitude of israel , as well to the women as men , to every one a cake of bread , and a good piece of flesh , and a flagon of wine . so all the people departed every one to his house .
and under their hand was an army , three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred , that made war with mighty power , to help the king against the enemy .
and as soon as david had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings , he blessed the people in the name of the lord of hosts .
the whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valour were two thousand and six hundred .
and they brought in the ark of the lord , and set it in his place , in the midst of the tabernacle that david had pitched for it : and david offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the lord .
then uzziah was wroth , and had a censer in his hand to burn incense : and while he was wroth with the priests , the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the lord , from beside the incense altar .
and azariah the priest went in after him , and with him fourscore priests of the lord , that were valiant men :
and it was told king david , saying , the lord hath blessed the house of obed - edom , and all that pertaineth unto him , because of the ark of god . so david went and brought up the ark of god from the house of obed - edom into the city of david with gladness .
so david would not remove the ark of the lord unto him into the city of david : but david carried it aside into the house of obed - edom the gittite .
moreover uzziah had an host of fighting men , that went out to war by bands , according to the number of their account by the hand of jeiel the scribe and maaseiah the ruler , under the hand of hananiah , one of the king ' s captains .
and as the ark of the lord came into the city of david , michal saul ' s daughter looked through a window , and saw king david leaping and dancing before the lord ; and she despised him in her heart .
also he built towers in the desert , and digged many wells : for he had much cattle , both in the low country , and in the plains : husbandmen also , and vine dressers in the mountains , and in carmel : for he loved husbandry .
so david and all the house of israel brought up the ark of the lord with shouting , and with the sound of the trumpet .
and ozias begat joatham ; and joatham begat achaz ; and achaz begat ezekias ;
and david danced before the lord with all his might ; and david was girded with a linen ephod .
and asa begat josaphat ; and josaphat begat joram ; and joram begat ozias ;
and it was so , that when they that bare the ark of the lord had gone six paces , he sacrificed oxen and fatlings .
and solomon begat roboam ; and roboam begat abia ; and abia begat asa ;
and jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables , and said ,
the kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king , which made a marriage for his son ,
and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding : and they would not come .
let every thing that hath breath praise the lord . praise ye the lord .
praise him with the timbrel and dance : praise him with stringed instruments and organs .
praise him upon the loud cymbals : praise him upon the high sounding cymbals .
praise him with the sound of the trumpet : praise him with the psaltery and harp .
and the philistines put themselves in array against israel : and when they joined battle , israel was smitten before the philistines : and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men .
and the word of samuel came to all israel . now israel went out against the philistines to battle , and pitched beside eben - ezer : and the philistines pitched in aphek .
praise ye the lord . praise god in his sanctuary : praise him in the firmament of his power .
so the people sent to shiloh , that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the lord of hosts , which dwelleth between the cherubims : and the two sons of eli , hophni and phinehas , were there with the ark of the covenant of god .
and thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar , and shalt put water therein .
and i will cause the noise of thy songs to cease ; and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard .
and thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation .
and i will make thee like the top of a rock : thou shalt be a place to spread nets upon ; thou shalt be built no more : for i the lord have spoken it , saith the lord god .
and thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony , and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle .
with the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets : he shall slay thy people by the sword , and thy strong garrisons shall go down to the ground .
and thou shalt bring in the table , and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it ; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick , and light the lamps thereof .
and they shall make a spoil of thy riches , and make a prey of thy merchandise : and they shall break down thy walls , and destroy thy pleasant houses : and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the water .
and they shall take up a lamentation for thee , and say to thee , how art thou destroyed , that wast inhabited of seafaring men , the renowned city , which wast strong in the sea , she and her inhabitants , which cause their terror to be on all that haunt it !
now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall ; yea , the isles that are in the sea shall be troubled at thy departure .
and thou shalt take the anointing oil , and anoint the tabernacle , and all that is therein , and shalt hallow it , and all the vessels thereof : and it shall be holy .
thus saith the lord god to tyrus ; shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall , when the wounded cry , when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee ?
for in those days shall be affliction , such as was not from the beginning of the creation which god created unto this time , neither shall be .
and thou shalt set up the court round about , and hang up the hanging at the court gate .
then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones , and lay away their robes , and put off their broidered garments : they shall clothe themselves with trembling ; they shall sit upon the ground , and shall tremble at every moment , and be astonished at thee .
and pray ye that your flight be not in the winter .
but woe to them that are with child , and to them that give suck in those days !
for thus saith the lord god ; when i shall make thee a desolate city , like the cities that are not inhabited ; when i shall bring up the deep upon thee , and great waters shall cover thee ;
and let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house , neither enter therein , to take any thing out of his house :
but when ye shall see the abomination of desolation , spoken of by daniel the prophet , standing where it ought not , ( let him that readeth understand , ) then let them that be in judaea flee to the mountains :
and ye shall be hated of all men for my name ' s sake : but he that shall endure unto the end , the same shall be saved .
now the brother shall betray the brother to death , and the father the son ; and children shall rise up against their parents , and shall cause them to be put to death .
but when they shall lead you , and deliver you up , take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak , neither do ye premeditate : but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour , that speak ye : for it is not ye that speak , but the holy ghost .
and the gospel must first be published among all nations .
abraham begat isaac ; and isaac begat jacob ; and jacob begat judas and his brethren ;
the book of the generation of jesus christ , the son of david , the son of abraham .
i will make thee a terror , and thou shalt be no more : though thou be sought for , yet shalt thou never be found again , saith the lord god .
and judas begat phares and zara of thamar ; and phares begat esrom ; and esrom begat aram ;
and jesse begat david the king ; and david the king begat solomon of her that had been the wife of urias ;
and salmon begat booz of rachab ; and booz begat obed of ruth ; and obed begat jesse ;
rejoice in the lord , o ye righteous : for praise is comely for the upright .
beside the burnt offering of the month , and his meat offering , and the daily burnt offering , and his meat offering , and their drink offerings , according unto their manner , for a sweet savour , a sacrifice made by fire unto the lord .
and one kid of the goats for a sin offering , to make an atonement for you :
and their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil , three tenth deals for a bullock , and two tenth deals for a ram ,
and their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil , three tenth deals to a bullock , and two tenth deals to one ram ,
but ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the lord for a sweet savour ; one young bullock , one ram , and seven lambs of the first year ; they shall be unto you without blemish :
and ye shall have on the tenth day of this seventh month an holy convocation ; and ye shall afflict your souls : ye shall not do any work therein :
lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping .
watch ye therefore : for ye know not when the master of the house cometh , at even , or at midnight , or at the cockcrowing , or in the morning :
for the son of man is as a man taking a far journey , who left his house , and gave authority to his servants , and to every man his work , and commanded the porter to watch .
take ye heed , watch and pray : for ye know not when the time is .
and what i say unto you i say unto all , watch .
and salah lived thirty years , and begat eber :
and arphaxad lived after he begat salah four hundred and three years , and begat sons and daughters .
and arphaxad lived five and thirty years , and begat salah :
and shem lived after he begat arphaxad five hundred years , and begat sons and daughters .
heaven and earth shall pass away : but my words shall not pass away .
these are the generations of shem : shem was an hundred years old , and begat arphaxad two years after the flood :
but of that day and that hour knoweth no man , no , not the angels which are in heaven , neither the son , but the father .
and peleg lived after he begat reu two hundred and nine years , and begat sons and daughters .
and peleg lived thirty years , and begat reu :
and eber lived after he begat peleg four hundred and thirty years , and begat sons and daughters .
and eber lived four and thirty years , and begat peleg :
and salah lived after he begat eber four hundred and three years , and begat sons and daughters .
but take ye heed : behold , i have foretold you all things .
for false christs and false prophets shall rise , and shall shew signs and wonders , to seduce , if it were possible , even the elect .
and the stars of heaven shall fall , and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken .
but in those days , after that tribulation , the sun shall be darkened , and the moon shall not give her light ,
and then shall he send his angels , and shall gather together his elect from the four winds , from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven .
and then shall they see the son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory .
so ye in like manner , when ye shall see these things come to pass , know that it is nigh , even at the doors .
now learn a parable of the fig tree ; when her branch is yet tender , and putteth forth leaves , ye know that summer is near :
and except that the lord had shortened those days , no flesh should be saved : but for the elect ' s sake , whom he hath chosen , he hath shortened the days .
and then if any man shall say to you , lo , here is christ ; or , lo , he is there ; believe him not :
and in the seventh month , on the first day of the month , ye shall have an holy convocation ; ye shall do no servile work : it is a day of blowing the trumpets unto you .
and ye shall offer a burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the lord ; one young bullock , one ram , and seven lambs of the first year without blemish :
and the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands , that they should not worship devils , and idols of gold , and silver , and brass , and stone , and of wood : which neither can see , nor hear , nor walk :
neither repented they of their murders , nor of their sorceries , nor of their fornication , nor of their thefts .
now these are they that came to david to ziklag , while he yet kept himself close because of saul the son of kish : and they were among the mighty men , helpers of the war .
see , i will tarry in the plain of the wilderness , until there come word from you to certify me .
they were armed with bows , and could use both the right hand and the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a bow , even of saul ' s brethren of benjamin .
zadok therefore and abiathar carried the ark of god again to jerusalem : and they tarried there .
the chief was ahiezer , then joash , the sons of shemaah the gibeathite ; and jeziel , and pelet , the sons of azmaveth ; and berachah , and jehu the antothite ,
but if he thus say , i have no delight in thee ; behold , here am i , let him do to me as seemeth good unto him .
and ismaiah the gibeonite , a mighty man among the thirty , and over the thirty ; and jeremiah , and jahaziel , and johanan , and josabad the gederathite ,
the king said also unto zadok the priest , art not thou a seer ? return into the city in peace , and your two sons with you , ahimaaz thy son , and jonathan the son of abiathar .
eluzai , and jerimoth , and bealiah , and shemariah , and shephatiah the haruphite ,
and lo zadok also , and all the levites were with him , bearing the ark of the covenant of god : and they set down the ark of god ; and abiathar went up , until all the people had done passing out of the city .
elkanah , and jesiah , and azareel , and joezer , and jashobeam , the korhites ,
and the king said unto zadok , carry back the ark of god into the city : if i shall find favour in the eyes of the lord , he will bring me again , and shew me both it , and his habitation :
and joelah , and zebadiah , the sons of jeroham of gedor .
and david said to ittai , go and pass over . and ittai the gittite passed over , and all his men , and all the little ones that were with him .
and of the gadites there separated themselves unto david into the hold to the wilderness men of might , and men of war fit for the battle , that could handle shield and buckler , whose faces were like the faces of lions , and were as swift as the roes upon the mountains ;
and all the country wept with a loud voice , and all the people passed over : the king also himself passed over the brook kidron , and all the people passed over , toward the way of the wilderness .
and ittai answered the king , and said , as the lord liveth , and as my lord the king liveth , surely in what place my lord the king shall be , whether in death or life , even there also will thy servant be .
ezer the first , obadiah the second , eliab the third ,
whereas thou camest but yesterday , should i this day make thee go up and down with us ? seeing i go whither i may , return thou , and take back thy brethren : mercy and truth be with thee .
come , and let us return unto the lord : for he hath torn , and he will heal us ; he hath smitten , and he will bind us up .
and they had a king over them , which is the angel of the bottomless pit , whose name in the hebrew tongue is abaddon , but in the greek tongue hath his name apollyon .
o ephraim , what shall i do unto thee ? o judah , what shall i do unto thee ? for your goodness is as a morning cloud , and as the early dew it goeth away .
one woe is past ; and , behold , there come two woes more hereafter .
therefore have i hewed them by the prophets ; i have slain them by the words of my mouth : and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth .
and the sixth angel sounded , and i heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before god ,
after two days will he revive us : in the third day he will raise us up , and we shall live in his sight .
saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet , loose the four angels which are bound in the great river euphrates .
then shall we know , if we follow on to know the lord : his going forth is prepared as the morning ; and he shall come unto us as the rain , as the latter and former rain unto the earth .
so hushai david ' s friend came into the city , and absalom came into jerusalem .
unto whom david said , if thou passest on with me , then thou shalt be a burden unto me :
but if thou return to the city , and say unto absalom , i will be thy servant , o king ; as i have been thy father ' s servant hitherto , so will i now also be thy servant : then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of ahithophel .
and hast thou not there with thee zadok and abiathar the priests ? therefore it shall be , that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king ' s house , thou shalt tell it to zadok and abiathar the priests .
behold , they have there with them their two sons , ahimaaz zadok ' s son , and jonathan abiathar ' s son ; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear .
and david went up by the ascent of mount olivet , and wept as he went up , and had his head covered , and he went barefoot : and all the people that was with him covered every man his head , and they went up , weeping as they went up .
and it came to pass , that when david was come to the top of the mount , where he worshipped god , behold , hushai the archite came to meet him with his coat rent , and earth upon his head :
and one told david , saying , ahithophel is among the conspirators with absalom . and david said , o lord , i pray thee , turn the counsel of ahithophel into foolishness .
and the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand : and i heard the number of them .
and as troops of robbers wait for a man , so the company of priests murder in the way by consent : for they commit lewdness .
and the four angels were loosed , which were prepared for an hour , and a day , and a month , and a year , for to slay the third part of men .
gilead is a city of them that work iniquity , and is polluted with blood .
by these three was the third part of men killed , by the fire , and by the smoke , and by the brimstone , which issued out of their mouths .
but they like men have transgressed the covenant : there have they dealt treacherously against me .
and thus i saw the horses in the vision , and them that sat on them , having breastplates of fire , and of jacinth , and brimstone : and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions ; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone .
for their power is in their mouth , and in their tails : for their tails were like unto serpents , and had heads , and with them they do hurt .
then said the king to ittai the gittite , wherefore goest thou also with us ? return to thy place , and abide with the king : for thou art a stranger , and also an exile .
and with absalom went two hundred men out of jerusalem , that were called ; and they went in their simplicity , and they knew not any thing .
and absalom sent for ahithophel the gilonite , david ' s counseller , from his city , even from giloh , while he offered sacrifices . and the conspiracy was strong ; for the people increased continually with absalom .
and there came a messenger to david , saying , the hearts of the men of israel are after absalom .
and david said unto all his servants that were with him at jerusalem , arise , and let us flee ; for we shall not else escape from absalom : make speed to depart , lest he overtake us suddenly , and bring evil upon us , and smite the city with the edge of the sword .
and the king went forth , and all his household after him . and the king left ten women , which were concubines , to keep the house .
and the king went forth , and all the people after him , and tarried in a place that was far off .
and all his servants passed on beside him ; and all the cherethites , and all the pelethites , and all the gittites , six hundred men which came after him from gath , passed on before the king .
but absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of israel , saying , as soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet , then ye shall say , absalom reigneth in hebron .
and he shall take the two goats , and present them before the lord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
and aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering , which is for himself , and make an atonement for himself , and for his house .
and he shall take of the congregation of the children of israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering , and one ram for a burnt offering .
he shall put on the holy linen coat , and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh , and shall be girded with a linen girdle , and with the linen mitre shall he be attired : these are holy garments ; therefore shall he wash his flesh in water , and so put them on .
and aaron shall bring the goat upon which the lord ' s lot fell , and offer him for a sin offering .
and aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats ; one lot for the lord , and the other lot for the scapegoat .
thus shall aaron come into the holy place : with a young bullock for a sin offering , and a ram for a burnt offering .
and the lord said unto moses , speak unto aaron thy brother , that he come not at all times into the holy place within the vail before the mercy seat , which is upon the ark ; that he die not : for i will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat .
then came all the tribes of israel to david unto hebron , and spake , saying , behold , we are thy bone and thy flesh .
and the lord spake unto moses after the death of the two sons of aaron , when they offered before the lord , and died ;
also in time past , when saul was king over us , thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in israel : and the lord said to thee , thou shalt feed my people israel , and thou shalt be a captain over israel .
and uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death , and dwelt in a several house , being a leper ; for he was cut off from the house of the lord : and jotham his son was over the king ' s house , judging the people of the land .
now the rest of the acts of uzziah , first and last , did isaiah the prophet , the son of amoz , write .
and azariah the chief priest , and all the priests , looked upon him , and , behold , he was leprous in his forehead , and they thrust him out from thence ; yea , himself hasted also to go out , because the lord had smitten him .
so uzziah slept with his fathers , and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings ; for they said , he is a leper : and jotham his son reigned in his stead .
and her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the lord : it shall not be treasured nor laid up ; for her merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the lord , to eat sufficiently , and for durable clothing .
and it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years , that the lord will visit tyre , and she shall turn to her hire , and shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth .
and micah said unto him , dwell with me , and be unto me a father and a priest , and i will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year , and a suit of apparel , and thy victuals . so the levite went in .
then said micah , now know i that the lord will do me good , seeing i have a levite to my priest .
and micah consecrated the levite ; and the young man became his priest , and was in the house of micah .
pass through thy land as a river , o daughter of tarshish : there is no more strength .
he stretched out his hand over the sea , he shook the kingdoms : the lord hath given a commandment against the merchant city , to destroy the strong holds thereof .
and he said , thou shalt no more rejoice , o thou oppressed virgin , daughter of zidon : arise , pass over to chittim ; there also shalt thou have no rest .
behold the land of the chaldeans ; this people was not , till the assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness : they set up the towers thereof , they raised up the palaces thereof ; and he brought it to ruin .
howl , ye ships of tarshish : for your strength is laid waste .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that tyre shall be forgotten seventy years , according to the days of one king : after the end of seventy years shall tyre sing as an harlot .
take an harp , go about the city , thou harlot that hast been forgotten ; make sweet melody , sing many songs , that thou mayest be remembered .
give unto the lord , o ye kindreds of the people , give unto the lord glory and strength .
give unto the lord the glory due unto his name : bring an offering , and come into his courts .
and david said on that day , whosoever getteth up to the gutter , and smiteth the jebusites , and the lame and the blind , that are hated of david ' s soul , he shall be chief and captain . wherefore they said , the blind and the lame shall not come into the house .
for all the gods of the nations are idols : but the lord made the heavens .
nevertheless david took the strong hold of zion : the same is the city of david .
honour and majesty are before him : strength and beauty are in his sanctuary .
and the king and his men went to jerusalem unto the jebusites , the inhabitants of the land : which spake unto david , saying , except thou take away the blind and the lame , thou shalt not come in hither : thinking , david cannot come in hither .
in hebron he reigned over judah seven years and six months : and in jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all israel and judah .
a people great and tall , the children of the anakims , whom thou knowest , and of whom thou hast heard say , who can stand before the children of anak !
david was thirty years old when he began to reign , and he reigned forty years .
o worship the lord in the beauty of holiness : fear before him , all the earth .
so all the elders of israel came to the king to hebron ; and king david made a league with them in hebron before the lord : and they anointed david king over israel .
understand therefore , that the lord thy god giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness ; for thou art a stiffnecked people .
understand therefore this day , that the lord thy god is he which goeth over before thee ; as a consuming fire he shall destroy them , and he shall bring them down before thy face : so shalt thou drive them out , and destroy them quickly , as the lord hath said unto thee .
when i was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone , even the tables of the covenant which the lord made with you , then i abode in the mount forty days and forty nights , i neither did eat bread nor drink water :
remember , and forget not , how thou provokedst the lord thy god to wrath in the wilderness : from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of egypt , until ye came unto this place , ye have been rebellious against the lord .
also in horeb ye provoked the lord to wrath , so that the lord was angry with you to have destroyed you .
what man is like job , who drinketh up scorning like water ?
should i lie against my right ? my wound is incurable without transgression .
for job hath said , i am righteous : and god hath taken away my judgment .
let us choose to us judgment : let us know among ourselves what is good .
for the ear trieth words , as the mouth tasteth meat .
hear my words , o ye wise men ; and give ear unto me , ye that have knowledge .
furthermore elihu answered and said ,
for he hath said , it profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with god .
which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity , and walketh with wicked men .
thus saith the lord ; for three transgressions of edom , and for four , i will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because he did pursue his brother with the sword , and did cast off all pity , and his anger did tear perpetually , and he kept his wrath for ever :
but i will send a fire upon teman , which shall devour the palaces of bozrah .
thus saith the lord ; for three transgressions of the children of ammon , and for four , i will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they have ripped up the women with child of gilead , that they might enlarge their border :
but i will kindle a fire in the wall of rabbah , and it shall devour the palaces thereof , with shouting in the day of battle , with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind :
and their king shall go into captivity , he and his princes together , saith the lord .
and there were many lights in the upper chamber , where they were gathered together .
but thou shalt say unto them , this is a nation that obeyeth not the voice of the lord their god , nor receiveth correction : truth is perished , and is cut off from their mouth .
cut off thine hair , o jerusalem , and cast it away , and take up a lamentation on high places ; for the lord hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath .
then will i cause to cease from the cities of judah , and from the streets of jerusalem , the voice of mirth , and the voice of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom , and the voice of the bride : for the land shall be desolate .
therefore , behold , the days come , saith the lord , that it shall no more be called tophet , nor the valley of the son of hinnom , but the valley of slaughter : for they shall bury in tophet , till there be no place .
and they have built the high places of tophet , which is in the valley of the son of hinnom , to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire ; which i commanded them not , neither came it into my heart .
and there abode three months . and when the jews laid wait for him , as he was about to sail into syria , he purposed to return through macedonia .
for the children of judah have done evil in my sight , saith the lord : they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name , to pollute it .
and when he had gone over those parts , and had given them much exhortation , he came into greece ,
and after the uproar was ceased , paul called unto him the disciples , and embraced them , and departed for to go into macedonia .
and upon the first day of the week , when the disciples came together to break bread , paul preached unto them , ready to depart on the morrow ; and continued his speech until midnight .
and we sailed away from philippi after the days of unleavened bread , and came unto them to troas in five days ; where we abode seven days .
these going before tarried for us at troas .
and there accompanied him into asia sopater of berea ; and of the thessalonians , aristarchus and secundus ; and gaius of derbe , and timotheus ; and of asia , tychicus and trophimus .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
speak unto aaron , and unto his sons , and unto all the children of israel , and say unto them ; this is the thing which the lord hath commanded , saying ,
what man soever there be of the house of israel , that killeth an ox , or lamb , or goat , in the camp , or that killeth it out of the camp ,
and bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , to offer an offering unto the lord before the tabernacle of the lord ; blood shall be imputed unto that man ; he hath shed blood ; and that man shall be cut off from among his people :
to the end that the children of israel may bring their sacrifices , which they offer in the open field , even that they may bring them unto the lord , unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , unto the priest , and offer them for peace offerings unto the lord .
and the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the lord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , and burn the fat for a sweet savour unto the lord .
and they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils , after whom they have gone a whoring . this shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations .
and thou shalt say unto them , whatsoever man there be of the house of israel , or of the strangers which sojourn among you , that offereth a burnt offering of sacrifice ,
and bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , to offer it unto the lord ; even that man shall be cut off from among his people .
and i will give him the morning star .
he that hath an ear , let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches .
and i will kill her children with death ; and all the churches shall know that i am he which searcheth the reins and hearts : and i will give unto every one of you according to your works .
but unto you i say , and unto the rest in thyatira , as many as have not this doctrine , and which have not known the depths of satan , as they speak ; i will put upon you none other burden .
but that which ye have already hold fast till i come .
and he that overcometh , and keepeth my works unto the end , to him will i give power over the nations :
notwithstanding i have a few things against thee , because thou sufferest that woman jezebel , which calleth herself a prophetess , to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication , and to eat things sacrificed unto idols .
and i gave her space to repent of her fornication ; and she repented not .
behold , i will cast her into a bed , and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation , except they repent of their deeds .
is this house , which is called by my name , become a den of robbers in your eyes ? behold , even i have seen it , saith the lord .
but go ye now unto my place which was in shiloh , where i set my name at the first , and see what i did to it for the wickedness of my people israel .
and come and stand before me in this house , which is called by my name , and say , we are delivered to do all these abominations ?
and i will cast you out of my sight , as i have cast out all your brethren , even the whole seed of ephraim .
therefore pray not thou for this people , neither lift up cry nor prayer for them , neither make intercession to me : for i will not hear thee .
and now , because ye have done all these works , saith the lord , and i spake unto you , rising up early and speaking , but ye heard not ; and i called you , but ye answered not ;
therefore will i do unto this house , which is called by my name , wherein ye trust , and unto the place which i gave to you and to your fathers , as i have done to shiloh .
the children gather wood , and the fathers kindle the fire , and the women knead their dough , to make cakes to the queen of heaven , and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods , that they may provoke me to anger .
seest thou not what they do in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem ?
do they provoke me to anger ? saith the lord : do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces ?
also , o judah , he hath set an harvest for thee , when i returned the captivity of my people .
i have seen an horrible thing in the house of israel : there is the whoredom of ephraim , israel is defiled .
therefore thus saith the lord god ; behold , mine anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place , upon man , and upon beast , and upon the trees of the field , and upon the fruit of the ground ; and it shall burn , and shall not be quenched .
thus saith the lord of hosts , the god of israel ; put your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices , and eat flesh .
for i spake not unto your fathers , nor commanded them in the day that i brought them out of the land of egypt , concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices :
but this thing commanded i them , saying , obey my voice , and i will be your god , and ye shall be my people : and walk ye in all the ways that i have commanded you , that it may be well unto you .
but they hearkened not , nor inclined their ear , but walked in the counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart , and went backward , and not forward .
since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of egypt unto this day i have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets , daily rising up early and sending them :
yet they hearkened not unto me , nor inclined their ear , but hardened their neck : they did worse than their fathers .
therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them ; but they will not hearken to thee : thou shalt also call unto them ; but they will not answer thee .
pharaoh king of egypt , and his servants , and his princes , and all his people ;
and they shall drink , and be moved , and be mad , because of the sword that i will send among them .
for thus saith the lord god of israel unto me ; take the wine cup of this fury at my hand , and cause all the nations , to whom i send thee , to drink it .
to wit , jerusalem , and the cities of judah , and the kings thereof , and the princes thereof , to make them a desolation , an astonishment , an hissing , and a curse ; as it is this day ;
then took i the cup at the lord ' s hand , and made all the nations to drink , unto whom the lord had sent me :
and it shall come to pass , when seventy years are accomplished , that i will punish the king of babylon , and that nation , saith the lord , for their iniquity , and the land of the chaldeans , and will make it perpetual desolations .
and this whole land shall be a desolation , and an astonishment ; and these nations shall serve the king of babylon seventy years .
for many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also : and i will recompense them according to their deeds , and according to the works of their own hands .
and i will bring upon that land all my words which i have pronounced against it , even all that is written in this book , which jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations .
moreover i will take from them the voice of mirth , and the voice of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom , and the voice of the bride , the sound of the millstones , and the light of the candle .
and haran died before his father terah in the land of his nativity , in ur of the chaldees .
and thou shalt say unto them , this is the offering made by fire which ye shall offer unto the lord ; two lambs of the first year without spot day by day , for a continual burnt offering .
and abram and nahor took them wives : the name of abram ' s wife was sarai ; and the name of nahor ' s wife , milcah , the daughter of haran , the father of milcah , and the father of iscah .
command the children of israel , and say unto them , my offering , and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire , for a sweet savour unto me , shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season .
and terah lived seventy years , and begat abram , nahor , and haran .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
and all the mingled people , and all the kings of the land of uz , and all the kings of the land of the philistines , and ashkelon , and azzah , and ekron , and the remnant of ashdod ,
now these are the generations of terah : terah begat abram , nahor , and haran ; and haran begat lot .
edom , and moab , and the children of ammon ,
and nahor lived nine and twenty years , and begat terah :
and all the kings of tyrus , and all the kings of zidon , and the kings of the isles which are beyond the sea ,
and nahor lived after he begat terah an hundred and nineteen years , and begat sons and daughters .
dedan , and tema , and buz , and all that are in the utmost corners ,
and serug lived thirty years , and begat nahor :
and all the kings of arabia , and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the desert ,
and serug lived after he begat nahor two hundred years , and begat sons and daughters .
and all the kings of zimri , and all the kings of elam , and all the kings of the medes ,
and reu lived two and thirty years , and begat serug :
produce your cause , saith the lord ; bring forth your strong reasons , saith the king of jacob .
and all the kings of the north , far and near , one with another , and all the kingdoms of the world , which are upon the face of the earth : and the king of sheshach shall drink after them .
and reu lived after he begat serug two hundred and seven years , and begat sons and daughters .
that they may see , and know , and consider , and understand together , that the hand of the lord hath done this , and the holy one of israel hath created it .
therefore thou shalt say unto them , thus saith the lord of hosts , the god of israel ; drink ye , and be drunken , and spue , and fall , and rise no more , because of the sword which i will send among you .
shew the things that are to come hereafter , that we may know that ye are gods : yea , do good , or do evil , that we may be dismayed , and behold it together .
and it shall be , if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink , then shalt thou say unto them , thus saith the lord of hosts ; ye shall certainly drink .
let them bring them forth , and shew us what shall happen : let them shew the former things , what they be , that we may consider them , and know the latter end of them ; or declare us things for to come .
for , lo , i begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name , and should ye be utterly unpunished ? ye shall not be unpunished : for i will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth , saith the lord of hosts .
behold , ye are of nothing , and your work of nought : an abomination is he that chooseth you .
i have raised up one from the north , and he shall come : from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name : and he shall come upon princes as upon morter , and as the potter treadeth clay .
who hath declared from the beginning , that we may know ? and beforetime , that we may say , he is righteous ? yea , there is none that sheweth , yea , there is none that declareth , yea , there is none that heareth your words .
the first shall say to zion , behold , behold them : and i will give to jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings .
for i beheld , and there was no man ; even among them , and there was no counseller , that , when i asked of them , could answer a word .
behold , they are all vanity ; their works are nothing : their molten images are wind and confusion .
and to them which were in hormah , and to them which were in chor - ashan , and to them which were in athach ,
and to them which were in hebron , and to all the places where david himself and his men were wont to haunt .
a noise shall come even to the ends of the earth ; for the lord hath a controversy with the nations , he will plead with all flesh ; he will give them that are wicked to the sword , saith the lord .
thus saith the lord of hosts , behold , evil shall go forth from nation to nation , and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth .
therefore prophesy thou against them all these words , and say unto them , the lord shall roar from on high , and utter his voice from his holy habitation ; he shall mightily roar upon his habitation ; he shall give a shout , as they that tread the grapes , against all the inhabitants of the earth .
and the shepherds shall have no way to flee , nor the principal of the flock to escape .
a voice of the cry of the shepherds , and an howling of the principal of the flock , shall be heard : for the lord hath spoiled their pasture .
and the slain of the lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth : they shall not be lamented , neither gathered , nor buried ; they shall be dung upon the ground .
howl , ye shepherds , and cry ; and wallow yourselves in the ashes , ye principal of the flock : for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished ; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel .
which were a grief of mind unto isaac and to rebekah .
thou shalt seek them , and shalt not find them , even them that contended with thee : they that war against thee shall be as nothing , and as a thing of nought .
but sarai was barren ; she had no child .
behold , all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded : they shall be as nothing ; and they that strive with thee shall perish .
fear thou not ; for i am with thee : be not dismayed ; for i am thy god : i will strengthen thee ; yea , i will help thee ; yea , i will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness .
and the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce anger of the lord .
and esau was forty years old when he took to wife judith the daughter of beeri the hittite , and bashemath the daughter of elon the hittite :
and the days of terah were two hundred and five years : and terah died in haran .
he hath forsaken his covert , as the lion : for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor , and because of his fierce anger .
behold , i will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth : thou shalt thresh the mountains , and beat them small , and shalt make the hills as chaff .
thou shalt fan them , and the wind shall carry them away , and the whirlwind shall scatter them : and thou shalt rejoice in the lord , and shalt glory in the holy one of israel .
for i the lord thy god will hold thy right hand , saying unto thee , fear not ; i will help thee .
fear not , thou worm jacob , and ye men of israel ; i will help thee , saith the lord , and thy redeemer , the holy one of israel .
i will plant in the wilderness the cedar , the shittah tree , and the myrtle , and the oil tree ; i will set in the desert the fir tree , and the pine , and the box tree together :
when the poor and needy seek water , and there is none , and their tongue faileth for thirst , i the lord will hear them , i the god of israel will not forsake them .
i will open rivers in high places , and fountains in the midst of the valleys : i will make the wilderness a pool of water , and the dry land springs of water .
the one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning , and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even ;
and a tenth part of an ephah of flour for a meat offering , mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil .
it is a continual burnt offering , which was ordained in mount sinai for a sweet savour , a sacrifice made by fire unto the lord .
and the drink offering thereof shall be the fourth part of an hin for the one lamb : in the holy place shalt thou cause the strong wine to be poured unto the lord for a drink offering .
and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even : as the meat offering of the morning , and as the drink offering thereof , thou shalt offer it , a sacrifice made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the lord .
blessed is the people that know the joyful sound : they shall walk , o lord , in the light of thy countenance .
justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne : mercy and truth shall go before thy face .
for thou art the glory of their strength : and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted .
in thy name shall they rejoice all the day : and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted .
and thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony , and cover the ark with the vail .
the heavens are thine , the earth also is thine : as for the world and the fulness thereof , thou hast founded them .
on the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation .
thou hast broken rahab in pieces , as one that is slain ; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
thou hast a mighty arm : strong is thy hand , and high is thy right hand .
the north and the south thou hast created them : tabor and hermon shall rejoice in thy name .
praise ye the lord . praise ye the name of the lord ; praise him , o ye servants of the lord .
ye that stand in the house of the lord , in the courts of the house of our god ,
then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one , and saidst , i have laid help upon one that is mighty ; i have exalted one chosen out of the people .
for i know that the lord is great , and that our lord is above all gods .
for the lord is our defence ; and the holy one of israel is our king .
whatsoever the lord pleased , that did he in heaven , and in earth , in the seas , and all deep places .
praise the lord ; for the lord is good : sing praises unto his name ; for it is pleasant .
for the lord hath chosen jacob unto himself , and israel for his peculiar treasure .
and david sware moreover , and said , thy father certainly knoweth that i have found grace in thine eyes ; and he saith , let not jonathan know this , lest he be grieved : but truly as the lord liveth , and as thy soul liveth , there is but a step between me and death .
then said jonathan unto david , whatsoever thy soul desireth , i will even do it for thee .
and david fled from naioth in ramah , and came and said before jonathan , what have i done ? what is mine iniquity ? and what is my sin before thy father , that he seeketh my life ?
and he said unto him , god forbid ; thou shalt not die : behold , my father will do nothing either great or small , but that he will shew it me : and why should my father hide this thing from me ? it is not so .
my mercy will i keep for him for evermore , and my covenant shall stand fast with him .
also i will make him my firstborn , higher than the kings of the earth .
he shall cry unto me , thou art my father , my god , and the rock of my salvation .
i will set his hand also in the sea , and his right hand in the rivers .
but my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him : and in my name shall his horn be exalted .
and i will beat down his foes before his face , and plague them that hate him .
the enemy shall not exact upon him ; nor the son of wickedness afflict him .
with whom my hand shall be established : mine arm also shall strengthen him .
if thy father at all miss me , then say , david earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to bethlehem his city : for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family .
and david said unto jonathan , behold , to morrow is the new moon , and i should not fail to sit with the king at meat : but let me go , that i may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even .
therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant ; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the lord with thee : notwithstanding , if there be in me iniquity , slay me thyself ; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father ?
if he say thus , it is well ; thy servant shall have peace : but if he be very wroth , then be sure that evil is determined by him .
and jonathan said , far be it from thee : for if i knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee , then would not i tell it thee ?
his seed also will i make to endure for ever , and his throne as the days of heaven .
i have found david my servant ; with my holy oil have i anointed him :
how fair is thy love , my sister , my spouse ! how much better is thy love than wine ! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices !
and the little chambers thereof , and the posts thereof , and the arches thereof , according to these measures : and there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about : it was fifty cubits long , and five and twenty cubits broad .
and he brought me to the inner court by the south gate : and he measured the south gate according to these measures ;
a garden inclosed is my sister , my spouse ; a spring shut up , a fountain sealed .
and there was a gate in the inner court toward the south : and he measured from gate to gate toward the south an hundred cubits .
thy lips , o my spouse , drop as the honeycomb : honey and milk are under thy tongue ; and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of lebanon .
and there were seven steps to go up to it , and the arches thereof were before them : and it had palm trees , one on this side , and another on that side , upon the posts thereof .
spikenard and saffron ; calamus and cinnamon , with all trees of frankincense ; myrrh and aloes , with all the chief spices :
and there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about , like those windows : the length was fifty cubits , and the breadth five and twenty cubits .
thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates , with pleasant fruits ; camphire , with spikenard ,
after that he brought me toward the south , and behold a gate toward the south : and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures .
awake , o north wind ; and come , thou south ; blow upon my garden , that the spices thereof may flow out . let my beloved come into his garden , and eat his pleasant fruits .
a fountain of gardens , a well of living waters , and streams from lebanon .
and their windows , and their arches , and their palm trees , were after the measure of the gate that looketh toward the east ; and they went up unto it by seven steps ; and the arches thereof were before them .
then will i visit their transgression with the rod , and their iniquity with stripes .
and the little chambers thereof were three on this side and three on that side ; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate : the length thereof was fifty cubits , and the breadth five and twenty cubits .
all this was done , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet , saying ,
nevertheless my lovingkindness will i not utterly take from him , nor suffer my faithfulness to fail .
and the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north , he measured the length thereof , and the breadth thereof .
and if any man say ought unto you , ye shall say , the lord hath need of them ; and straightway he will send them .
my covenant will i not break , nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips .
saying unto them , go into the village over against you , and straightway ye shall find an ass tied , and a colt with her : loose them , and bring them unto me .
once have i sworn by my holiness that i will not lie unto david .
and when they drew nigh unto jerusalem , and were come to bethphage , unto the mount of olives , then sent jesus two disciples ,
his seed shall endure forever , and his throne as the sun before me .
it shall be established for ever as the moon , and as a faithful witness in heaven . selah .
but thou hast cast off and abhorred , thou hast been wroth with thine anointed .
thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant : thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground .
if they break my statutes , and keep not my commandments ;
if his children forsake my law , and walk not in my judgments ;
and abimelech said , what is this thou hast done unto us ? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife , and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us .
and there were narrow windows to the little chambers , and to their posts within the gate round about , and likewise to the arches : and windows were round about inward : and upon each post were palm trees .
and from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits .
and the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length of the gates was the lower pavement .
then brought he me into the outward court , and , lo , there were chambers , and a pavement made for the court round about : thirty chambers were upon the pavement .
and he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate , ten cubits ; and the length of the gate , thirteen cubits .
he made also posts of threescore cubits , even unto the post of the court round about the gate .
he measured then the gate from the roof of one little chamber to the roof of another : the breadth was five and twenty cubits , door against door .
the days of his youth hast thou shortened : thou hast covered him with shame . selah .
how long , lord ? wilt thou hide thyself for ever ? shall thy wrath burn like fire ?
thou hast also turned the edge of his sword , and hast not made him to stand in the battle .
and the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on this side , and three on that side ; they three were of one measure : and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side .
thou hast made his glory to cease , and cast his throne down to the ground .
lord , where are thy former lovingkindnesses , which thou swarest unto david in thy truth ?
remember how short my time is : wherefore hast thou made all men in vain ?
what man is he that liveth , and shall not see death ? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave ? selah .
thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries ; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice .
all that pass by the way spoil him : he is a reproach to his neighbours .
thou hast broken down all his hedges ; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin .
the lord is in his holy temple , the lord ' s throne is in heaven : his eyes behold , his eyelids try , the children of men .
the lord trieth the righteous : but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth .
for , lo , the wicked bend their bow , they make ready their arrow upon the string , that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart .
if the foundations be destroyed , what can the righteous do ?
he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth ; he maketh lightnings for the rain ; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries .
then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without , an hundred cubits eastward and northward .
who smote the firstborn of egypt , both of man and beast .
upon the wicked he shall rain snares , fire and brimstone , and an horrible tempest : this shall be the portion of their cup .
for the righteous lord loveth righteousness ; his countenance doth behold the upright .
and he went up from thence to beer - sheba .
our soul waiteth for the lord : he is our help and our shield .
so he measured the court , an hundred cubits long , and an hundred cubits broad , foursquare ; and the altar that was before the house .
and he removed from thence , and digged another well ; and for that they strove not : and he called the name of it rehoboth ; and he said , for now the lord hath made room for us , and we shall be fruitful in the land .
for our heart shall rejoice in him , because we have trusted in his holy name .
and the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests , the keepers of the charge of the altar : these are the sons of zadok among the sons of levi , which come near to the lord to minister unto him .
and he builded an altar there , and called upon the name of the lord and pitched his tent there : and there isaac ' s servants digged a well .
let thy mercy , o lord , be upon us , according as we hope in thee .
and he said unto me , this chamber , whose prospect is toward the south , is for the priests , the keepers of the charge of the house .
and the lord appeared unto him the same night , and said , i am the god of abraham thy father : fear not , for i am with thee , and will bless thee , and multiply thy seed for my servant abraham ' s sake .
and without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court , which was at the side of the north gate ; and their prospect was toward the south : one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north .
and isaac said unto them , wherefore come ye to me , seeing ye hate me , and have sent me away from you ?
then abimelech went to him from gerar , and ahuzzath one of his friends , and phichol the chief captain of his army .
that thou wilt do us no hurt , as we have not touched thee , and as we have done unto thee nothing but good , and have sent thee away in peace : thou art now the blessed of the lord .
the length of the porch was twenty cubits , and the breadth eleven cubits ; and he brought me by the steps whereby they went up to it : and there were pillars by the posts , one on this side , and another on that side .
and they said , we saw certainly that the lord was with thee : and we said , let there be now an oath betwixt us , even betwixt us and thee , and let us make a covenant with thee ;
and he brought me to the porch of the house , and measured each post of the porch , five cubits on this side , and five cubits on that side : and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side , and three cubits on that side .
how long , ye simple ones , will ye love simplicity ? and the scorners delight in their scorning , and fools hate knowledge ?
wisdom crieth without ; she uttereth her voice in the streets :
she crieth in the chief place of concourse , in the openings of the gates : in the city she uttereth her words , saying ,
i also will laugh at your calamity ; i will mock when your fear cometh ;
and within were hooks , an hand broad , fastened round about : and upon the tables was the flesh of the offering .
when your fear cometh as desolation , and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind ; when distress and anguish cometh upon you .
and the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt offering , of a cubit and an half long , and a cubit and an half broad , and one cubit high : whereupon also they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice .
four tables were on this side , and four tables on that side , by the side of the gate ; eight tables , whereupon they slew their sacrifices .
but ye have set at nought all my counsel , and would none of my reproof :
and at the side without , as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate , were two tables ; and on the other side , which was at the porch of the gate , were two tables .
and truly , if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out , they might have had opportunity to have returned .
wherewith thine enemies have reproached , o lord ; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed .
for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country .
but david pursued , he and four hundred men : for two hundred abode behind , which were so faint that they could not go over the brook besor .
remember , lord , the reproach of thy servants ; how i do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people ;
by faith abraham , when he was tried , offered up isaac : and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son ,
and they found an egyptian in the field , and brought him to david , and gave him bread , and he did eat ; and they made him drink water ;
for that they hated knowledge , and did not choose the fear of the lord :
but now they desire a better country , that is , an heavenly : wherefore god is not ashamed to be called their god : for he hath prepared for them a city .
and they gave him a piece of a cake of figs , and two clusters of raisins : and when he had eaten , his spirit came again to him : for he had eaten no bread , nor drunk any water , three days and three nights .
blessed be the lord for evermore . amen , and amen .
then shall they call upon me , but i will not answer ; they shall seek me early , but they shall not find me :
through faith also sara herself received strength to conceive seed , and was delivered of a child when she was past age , because she judged him faithful who had promised .
for he looked for a city which hath foundations , whose builder and maker is god .
these all died in faith , not having received the promises , but having seen them afar off , and were persuaded of them , and embraced them , and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth .
therefore sprang there even of one , and him as good as dead , so many as the stars of the sky in multitude , and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable .
and david smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day : and there escaped not a man of them , save four hundred young men , which rode upon camels , and fled .
and there was nothing lacking to them , neither small nor great , neither sons nor daughters , neither spoil , nor any thing that they had taken to them : david recovered all .
and david said unto him , to whom belongest thou ? and whence art thou ? and he said , i am a young man of egypt , servant to an amalekite ; and my master left me , because three days agone i fell sick .
we made an invasion upon the south of the cherethites , and upon the coast which belongeth to judah , and upon the south of caleb ; and we burned ziklag with fire .
and he made them a feast , and they did eat and drink .
and david said to him , canst thou bring me down to this company ? and he said , swear unto me by god , that thou wilt neither kill me , nor deliver me into the hands of my master , and i will bring thee down to this company .
and they rose up betimes in the morning , and sware one to another : and isaac sent them away , and they departed from him in peace .
and when he had brought him down , behold , they were spread abroad upon all the earth , eating and drinking , and dancing , because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the philistines , and out of the land of judah .
for he had possession of flocks , and possessions of herds , and great store of servants : and the philistines envied him .
the counsel of the lord standeth for ever , the thoughts of his heart to all generations .
and the arches thereof were toward the outward court ; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof , on this side , and on that side : and the going up to it had eight steps .
and the man waxed great , and went forward , and grew until he became very great :
blessed is the nation whose god is the lord : and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance .
and the little chambers thereof , and the posts thereof , and the arches thereof , were according to these measures : and there were windows therein and in the arches thereof round about : it was fifty cubits long , and five and twenty cubits broad .
then isaac sowed in that land , and received in the same year an hundredfold : and the lord blessed him .
the little chambers thereof , the posts thereof , and the arches thereof , and the windows to it round about : the length was fifty cubits , and the breadth five and twenty cubits .
and abimelech charged all his people , saying , he that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death .
the lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought : he maketh the devices of the people of none effect .
and he brought me to the north gate , and measured it according to these measures ;
and isaac digged again the wells of water , which they had digged in the days of abraham his father ; for the philistines had stopped them after the death of abraham : and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them .
he fashioneth their hearts alike ; he considereth all their works .
and the chambers and the entries thereof were by the posts of the gates , where they washed the burnt offering .
and isaac departed thence , and pitched his tent in the valley of gerar , and dwelt there .
there is no king saved by the multitude of an host : a mighty man is not delivered by much strength .
and the posts thereof were toward the utter court ; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof , on this side , and on that side : and the going up to it had eight steps .
and abimelech said unto isaac , go from us ; for thou art much mightier than we .
the lord looketh from heaven ; he beholdeth all the sons of men .
for all the wells which his father ' s servants had digged in the days of abraham his father , the philistines had stopped them , and filled them with earth .
from the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth .
and in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side , and two tables on that side , to slay thereon the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering .
to deliver their soul from death , and to keep them alive in famine .
my son , if sinners entice thee , consent thou not .
an horse is a vain thing for safety : neither shall he deliver any by his great strength .
if they say , come with us , let us lay wait for blood , let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause :
behold , the eye of the lord is upon them that fear him , upon them that hope in his mercy ;
let us swallow them up alive as the grave ; and whole , as those that go down into the pit :
we shall find all precious substance , we shall fill our houses with spoil :
and the arches round about were five and twenty cubits long , and five cubits broad .
of whom it was said , that in isaac shall thy seed be called :
my son , walk not thou in the way with them ; refrain thy foot from their path :
and he brought me into the inner court toward the east : and he measured the gate according to these measures .
accounting that god was able to raise him up , even from the dead ; from whence also he received him in a figure .
and the arches thereof were toward the utter court ; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof : and the going up to it had eight steps .
and they lay wait for their own blood ; they lurk privily for their own lives .
tell ye the daughter of sion , behold , thy king cometh unto thee , meek , and sitting upon an ass , and a colt the foal of an ass .
by faith he forsook egypt , not fearing the wrath of the king : for he endured , as seeing him who is invisible .
then said david , ye shall not do so , my brethren , with that which the lord hath given us , who hath preserved us , and delivered the company that came against us into our hand .
surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird .
and the disciples went , and did as jesus commanded them ,
and david took all the flocks and the herds , which they drave before those other cattle , and said , this is david ' s spoil .
and brought the ass , and the colt , and put on them their clothes , and they set him thereon .
choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of god , than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season ;
so are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain ; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof .
and a very great multitude spread their garments in the way ; others cut down branches from the trees , and strawed them in the way .
by faith moses , when he was come to years , refused to be called the son of pharaoh ' s daughter ;
and the multitudes that went before , and that followed , cried , saying , hosanna to the son of david : blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord ; hosanna in the highest .
by faith moses , when he was born , was hid three months of his parents , because they saw he was a proper child ; and they were not afraid of the king ' s commandment .
by faith joseph , when he died , made mention of the departing of the children of israel ; and gave commandment concerning his bones .
by faith jacob , when he was a dying , blessed both the sons of joseph ; and worshipped , leaning upon the top of his staff .
by faith isaac blessed jacob and esau concerning things to come .
and to them which were in aroer , and to them which were in siphmoth , and to them which were in eshtemoa ,
and the herdmen of gerar did strive with isaac ' s herdmen , saying , the water is ours : and he called the name of the well esek ; because they strove with him .
to them which were in bethel , and to them which were in south ramoth , and to them which were in jattir ,
and they digged another well , and strove for that also : and he called the name of it sitnah .
for who will hearken unto you in this matter ? but as his part is that goeth down to the battle , so shall his part be that tarrieth by the stuff : they shall part alike .
and it was so from that day forward , that he made it a statute and an ordinance for israel unto this day .
therefore is judgment far from us , neither doth justice overtake us : we wait for light , but behold obscurity ; for brightness , but we walk in darkness .
and call no man your father upon the earth : for one is your father , which is in heaven .
the way of peace they know not ; and there is no judgment in their goings : they have made them crooked paths : whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace .
but be not ye called rabbi : for one is your master , even christ ; and all ye are brethren .
their feet run to evil , and they make hast to shed innocent blood : their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity ; wasting and destruction are in their paths .
and greetings in the markets , and to be called of men , rabbi , rabbi .
and love the uppermost rooms at feasts , and the chief seats in the synagogues ,
but all their works they do for to be seen of men : they make broad their phylacteries , and enlarge the borders of their garments ,
all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe , that observe and do ; but do not ye after their works : for they say , and do not .
but the hand of the lord was heavy upon them of ashdod , and he destroyed them , and smote them with emerods , even ashdod and the coasts thereof .
and when the men of ashdod saw that it was so , they said , the ark of the god of israel shall not abide with us : for his hand is sore upon us , and upon dagon our god .
and when they arose early on the morrow morning , behold , dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the lord ; and the head of dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold ; only the stump of dagon was left to him .
therefore neither the priests of dagon , nor any that come into dagon ' s house , tread on the threshold of dagon in ashdod unto this day .
and it was so , that , after they had carried it about , the hand of the lord was against the city with a very great destruction : and he smote the men of the city , both small and great , and they had emerods in their secret parts .
knowing this first , that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation .
to him which smote great kings : for his mercy endureth for ever :
for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man : but holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost .
and slew famous kings : for his mercy endureth for ever :
sihon king of the amorites : for his mercy endureth for ever :
to him which divided the red sea into parts : for his mercy endureth for ever :
and made israel to pass through the midst of it : for his mercy endureth for ever :
but overthrew pharaoh and his host in the red sea : for his mercy endureth for ever .
to him which led his people through the wilderness : for his mercy endureth for ever .
behold , the lord ' s hand is not shortened , that it cannot save ; neither his ear heavy , that it cannot hear :
to him that smote egypt in their firstborn : for his mercy endureth for ever :
but your iniquities have separated between you and your god , and your sins have hid his face from you , that he will not hear .
and brought out israel from among them : for his mercy endureth for ever :
with a strong hand , and with a stretched out arm : for his mercy endureth for ever .
they hatch cockatrice ' eggs , and weave the spider ' s web : he that eateth of their eggs dieth , and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper .
their webs shall not become garments , neither shall they cover themselves with their works : their works are works of iniquity , and the act of violence is in their hands .
for your hands are defiled with blood , and your fingers with iniquity ; your lips have spoken lies , your tongue hath muttered perverseness .
none calleth for justice , nor any pleadeth for truth : they trust in vanity , and speak lies ; they conceive mischief , and bring forth iniquity .
o give thanks unto the god of heaven : for his mercy endureth for ever .
and hath redeemed us from our enemies : for his mercy endureth for ever .
who giveth food to all flesh : for his mercy endureth for ever .
even an heritage unto israel his servant : for his mercy endureth for ever .
who remembered us in our low estate : for his mercy endureth for ever :
and og the king of bashan : for his mercy endureth for ever :
and gave their land for an heritage : for his mercy endureth for ever :
jesus said unto them , verily , verily , i say unto you , before abraham was , i am .
then took they up stones to cast at him : but jesus hid himself , and went out of the temple , going through the midst of them , and so passed by .
and spake kindly unto him , and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in babylon ,
to the only wise god our saviour , be glory and majesty , dominion and power , both now and ever . amen .
and changed his prison garments : and he did continually eat bread before him all the days of his life .
now unto him that is able to keep you from falling , and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy ,
and for his diet , there was a continual diet given him of the king of babylon , every day a portion until the day of his death , all the days of his life .
in the three and twentieth year of nebuchadrezzar nebuzar - adan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the jews seven hundred forty and five persons : all the persons were four thousand and six hundred .
they would none of my counsel : they despised all my reproof .
verily , verily , i say unto you , if a man keep my saying , he shall never see death .
and i seek not mine own glory : there is one that seeketh and judgeth .
but whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely , and shall be quiet from fear of evil .
art thou greater than our father abraham , which is dead ? and the prophets are dead : whom makest thou thyself ?
for the turning away of the simple shall slay them , and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them .
then said the jews unto him , now we know that thou hast a devil . abraham is dead , and the prophets ; and thou sayest , if a man keep my saying , he shall never taste of death .
have respect unto the covenant : for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty .
therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way , and be filled with their own devices .
o let not the oppressed return ashamed : let the poor and needy praise thy name .
jesus answered , if i honour myself , my honour is nothing : it is my father that honoureth me ; of whom ye say , that he is your god :
arise , o god , plead thine own cause : remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily .
then said the jews unto him , thou art not yet fifty years old , and hast thou seen abraham ?
forget not the voice of thine enemies : the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually .
your father abraham rejoiced to see my day : and he saw it , and was glad .
and enoch also , the seventh from adam , prophesied of these , saying , behold , the lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints ,
raging waves of the sea , foaming out their own shame ; wandering stars , to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever .
these are murmurers , complainers , walking after their own lusts ; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words , having men ' s persons in admiration because of advantage .
to execute judgment upon all , and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed , and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him .
how that they told you there should be mockers in the last time , who should walk after their own ungodly lusts .
but , beloved , remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our lord jesus christ ;
these be they who separate themselves , sensual , having not the spirit .
but ye , beloved , building up yourselves on your most holy faith , praying in the holy ghost ,
keep yourselves in the love of god , looking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ unto eternal life .
and of some have compassion , making a difference :
then spake jesus to the multitude , and to his disciples ,
and others save with fear , pulling them out of the fire ; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh .
saying , the scribes and the pharisees sit in moses ' seat :
i know that ye are abraham ' s seed ; but ye seek to kill me , because my word hath no place in you .
and the king of babylon slew the sons of zedekiah before his eyes : he slew also all the princes of judah in riblah .
if the son therefore shall make you free , ye shall be free indeed .
they answered and said unto him , abraham is our father . jesus saith unto them , if ye were abraham ' s children , ye would do the works of abraham .
now in the fifth month , in the tenth day of the month , which was the nineteenth year of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon , came nebuzar - adan , captain of the guard , which served the king of babylon , into jerusalem ,
i speak that which i have seen with my father : and ye do that which ye have seen with your father .
then he put out the eyes of zedekiah ; and the king of babylon bound him in chains , and carried him to babylon , and put him in prison till the day of his death .
these are spots in your feasts of charity , when they feast with you , feeding themselves without fear : clouds they are without water , carried about of winds ; trees whose fruit withereth , without fruit , twice dead , plucked up by the roots ;
and ye shall know the truth , and the truth shall make you free .
and burned the house of the lord , and the king ' s house ; and all the houses of jerusalem , and all the houses of the great men , burned he with fire :
woe unto them ! for they have gone in the way of cain , and ran greedily after the error of balaam for reward , and perished in the gainsaying of core .
they answered him , we be abraham ' s seed , and were never in bondage to any man : how sayest thou , ye shall be made free ?
and all the army of the chaldeans , that were with the captain of the guard , brake down all the walls of jerusalem round about .
jesus answered them , verily , verily , i say unto you , whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin .
then nebuzar - adan the captain of the guard carried away captive certain of the poor of the people , and the residue of the people that remained in the city , and those that fell away , that fell to the king of babylon , and the rest of the multitude .
and the servant abideth not in the house for ever : but the son abideth ever .
and it shall be unto you for a fringe , that ye may look upon it , and remember all the commandments of the lord , and do them ; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes , after which ye use to go a whoring :
but nebuzar - adan the captain of the guard left certain of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen .
speak unto the children of israel , and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations , and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue :
also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the lord , and the bases , and the brasen sea that was in the house of the lord , the chaldeans brake , and carried all the brass of them to babylon .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
the caldrons also , and the shovels , and the snuffers , and the bowls , and the spoons , and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered , took they away .
as he spake these words , many believed on him .
and all the congregation brought him without the camp , and stoned him with stones , and he died ; as the lord commanded moses .
and the basons , and the firepans , and the bowls , and the caldrons , and the candlesticks , and the spoons , and the cups ; that which was of gold in gold , and that which was of silver in silver , took the captain of the guard away .
then said jesus to those jews which believed on him , if ye continue in my word , then are ye my disciples indeed ;
and the lord said unto moses , the man shall be surely put to death : all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp .
and they put him in ward , because it was not declared what should be done to him .
and they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto moses and aaron , and unto all the congregation .
and while the children of israel were in the wilderness , they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day .
because he hath despised the word of the lord , and hath broken his commandment , that soul shall utterly be cut off ; his iniquity shall be upon him .
but the soul that doeth ought presumptuously , whether he be born in the land , or a stranger , the same reproacheth the lord ; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people .
then i spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the lord had shewed me .
afterwards the spirit took me up , and brought me in a vision by the spirit of god into chaldea , to them of the captivity . so the vision that i had seen went up from me .
and the glory of the lord went up from the midst of the city , and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city .
then did the cherubims lift up their wings , and the wheels beside them ; and the glory of the god of israel was over them above .
and there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side ; and all the pomegranates upon the network were an hundred round about .
but as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations , i will recompense their way upon their own heads , saith the lord god .
jesus answered , i have not a devil ; but i honour my father , and ye do dishonour me .
and a chapiter of brass was upon it ; and the height of one chapiter was five cubits , with network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round about , all of brass . the second pillar also and the pomegranates were like unto these .
that they may walk in my statutes , and keep mine ordinances , and do them : and they shall be my people , and i will be their god .
then answered the jews , and said unto him , say we not well that thou art a samaritan , and hast a devil ?
and concerning the pillars , the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits ; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it ; and the thickness thereof was four fingers : it was hollow .
he that is of god heareth god ' s words : ye therefore hear them not , because ye are not of god .
the two pillars , one sea , and twelve brasen bulls that were under the bases , which king solomon had made in the house of the lord : the brass of all these vessels was without weight .
and because i tell you the truth , ye believe me not .
so nebuzar - adan the captain of the guard took them , and brought them to the king of babylon to riblah .
which of you convinceth me of sin ? and if i say the truth , why do ye not believe me ?
and the king of babylon smote them , and put them to death in riblah in the land of hamath . thus judah was carried away captive out of his own land .
why do ye not understand my speech ? even because ye cannot hear my word .
and the captain of the guard took seraiah the chief priest , and zephaniah the second priest , and the three keepers of the door :
ye do the deeds of your father . then said they to him , we be not born of fornication ; we have one father , even god .
jesus said unto them , if god were your father , ye would love me : for i proceeded forth and came from god ; neither came i of myself , but he sent me .
this is the people whom nebuchadrezzar carried away captive : in the seventh year three thousand jews and three and twenty :
but now ye seek to kill me , a man that hath told you the truth , which i have heard of god : this did not abraham .
in the eighteenth year of nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons :
i am the lord your god , which brought you out of the land of egypt , to be your god : i am the lord your god .
that ye may remember , and do all my commandments , and be holy unto your god .
o magnify the lord with me , and let us exalt his name together .
i sought the lord , and he heard me , and delivered me from all my fears .
i will bless the lord at all times : his praise shall continually be in my mouth .
my soul shall make her boast in the lord : the humble shall hear thereof , and be glad .
the angel of the lord encampeth round about them that fear him , and delivereth them .
o taste and see that the lord is good : blessed is the man that trusteth in him .
they looked unto him , and were lightened : and their faces were not ashamed .
this poor man cried , and the lord heard him , and saved him out of all his troubles .
ye judge after the flesh ; i judge no man .
jesus answered and said unto them , though i bear record of myself , yet my record is true : for i know whence i came , and whither i go ; but ye cannot tell whence i come , and whither i go .
it is also written in your law , that the testimony of two men is true .
o fear the lord , ye his saints : for there is no want to them that fear him .
and yet if i judge , my judgment is true : for i am not alone , but i and the father that sent me .
then said they unto him , where is thy father ? jesus answered , ye neither know me , nor my father : if ye had known me , ye should have known my father also .
i am one that bear witness of myself , and the father that sent me beareth witness of me .
one law and one manner shall be for you , and for the stranger that sojourneth with you .
one ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation , and also for the stranger that sojourneth with you , an ordinance for ever in your generations : as ye are , so shall the stranger be before the lord .
and if a stranger sojourn with you , or whosoever be among you in your generations , and will offer an offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the lord ; as ye do , so he shall do .
all that are born of the country shall do these things after this manner , in offering an offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the lord .
when jesus had lifted up himself , and saw none but the woman , he said unto her , woman , where are those thine accusers ? hath no man condemned thee ?
she said , no man , lord . and jesus said unto her , neither do i condemn thee : go , and sin no more .
then it shall be , that , when ye eat of the bread of the land , ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the lord .
then spake jesus again unto them , saying , i am the light of the world : he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness , but shall have the light of life .
speak unto the children of israel , and say unto them , when ye come into the land whither i bring you ,
the pharisees therefore said unto him , thou bearest record of thyself ; thy record is not true .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
according to the number that ye shall prepare , so shall ye do to every one according to their number .
thus shall it be done for one bullock , or for one ram , or for a lamb , or a kid .
and thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine , for an offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the lord .
then said jesus unto them , when ye have lifted up the son of man , then shall ye know that i am he , and that i do nothing of myself ; but as my father hath taught me , i speak these things .
they understood not that he spake to them of the father .
i have many things to say and to judge of you : but he that sent me is true ; and i speak to the world those things which i have heard of him .
then said they unto him , who art thou ? and jesus saith unto them , even the same that i said unto you from the beginning .
and he that sent me is with me : the father hath not left me alone ; for i do always those things that please him .
and the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of israel , and it shall be forgiven them ; for it is ignorance : and they shall bring their offering , a sacrifice made by fire unto the lord , and their sin offering before the lord , for their ignorance :
if there be among you any man , that is not clean by reason of uncleanness that chanceth him by night , then shall he go abroad out of the camp , he shall not come within the camp :
these words spake jesus in the treasury , as he taught in the temple : and no man laid hands on him ; for his hour was not yet come .
but it shall be , when evening cometh on , he shall wash himself with water : and when the sun is down , he shall come into the camp again .
and if any soul sin through ignorance , then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering .
and it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of israel , and the stranger that sojourneth among them ; seeing all the people were in ignorance .
and he said unto them , ye are from beneath ; i am from above : ye are of this world ; i am not of this world .
ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance , both for him that is born among the children of israel , and for the stranger that sojourneth among them .
i said therefore unto you , that ye shall die in your sins : for if ye believe not that i am he , ye shall die in your sins .
and the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly , when he sinneth by ignorance before the lord , to make an atonement for him ; and it shall be forgiven him .
then said jesus again unto them , i go my way , and ye shall seek me , and shall die in your sins : whither i go , ye cannot come .
then said the jews , will he kill himself ? because he saith , whither i go , ye cannot come .
thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore , or the price of a dog , into the house of the lord thy god for any vow : for even both these are abomination unto the lord thy god .
thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother ; usury of money , usury of victuals , usury of any thing that is lent upon usury :
he shall dwell with thee , even among you , in that place which he shall choose in one of thy gates , where it liketh him best : thou shalt not oppress him .
there shall be no whore of the daughters of israel , nor a sodomite of the sons of israel .
and israel saw that great work which the lord did upon the egyptians : and the people feared the lord , and believed the lord , and his servant moses .
of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the lord an heave offering in your generations .
for the lord thy god walketh in the midst of thy camp , to deliver thee , and to give up thine enemies before thee ; therefore shall thy camp be holy : that he see no unclean thing in thee , and turn away from thee .
thus the lord saved israel that day out of the hand of the egyptians ; and israel saw the egyptians dead upon the sea shore .
ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave offering : as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor , so shall ye heave it .
thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped from his master unto thee :
even all that the lord hath commanded you by the hand of moses , from the day that the lord commanded moses , and henceforward among your generations ;
thou shalt have a place also without the camp , whither thou shalt go forth abroad :
and if ye have erred , and not observed all these commandments , which the lord hath spoken unto moses ,
and thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon ; and it shall be , when thou wilt ease thyself abroad , thou shalt dig therewith , and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee :
and it came between the camp of the egyptians and the camp of israel ; and it was a cloud and darkness to them , but it gave light by night to these : so that the one came not near the other all the night .
and the egyptians pursued , and went in after them to the midst of the sea , even all pharaoh ' s horses , his chariots , and his horsemen .
and it came to pass , that in the morning watch the lord looked unto the host of the egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud , and troubled the host of the egyptians ,
and moses stretched out his hand over the sea ; and the lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night , and made the sea dry land , and the waters were divided .
and the children of israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground : and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand , and on their left .
and the border shall go down to jordan , and the goings out of it shall be at the salt sea : this shall be your land with the coasts thereof round about .
and moses commanded the children of israel , saying , this is the land which ye shall inherit by lot , which the lord commanded to give unto the nine tribes , and to the half tribe :
and ye shall point out your east border from hazar - enan to shepham :
and the coast shall go down from shepham to riblah , on the east side of ain ; and the border shall descend , and shall reach unto the side of the sea of chinnereth eastward :
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
these are the names of the men which shall divide the land unto you : eleazar the priest , and joshua the son of nun .
for the tribe of the children of reuben according to the house of their fathers , and the tribe of the children of gad according to the house of their fathers , have received their inheritance ; and half the tribe of manasseh have received their inheritance :
the two tribes and the half tribe have received their inheritance on this side jordan near jericho eastward , toward the sunrising .
he that hath an ear , let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches ; to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the hidden manna , and will give him a white stone , and in the stone a new name written , which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it .
repent ; or else i will come unto thee quickly , and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth .
i know thy works , and charity , and service , and faith , and thy patience , and thy works ; and the last to be more than the first .
and unto the angel of the church in thyatira write ; these things saith the son of god , who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire , and his feet are like fine brass ;
i know thy works , and where thou dwellest , even where satan ' s seat is : and thou holdest fast my name , and hast not denied my faith , even in those days wherein antipas was my faithful martyr , who was slain among you , where satan dwelleth .
and the waters returned , and covered the chariots , and the horsemen , and all the host of pharaoh that came into the sea after them ; there remained not so much as one of them .
and to the angel of the church in pergamos write ; these things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges ;
and moses stretched forth his hand over the sea , and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared ; and the egyptians fled against it ; and the lord overthrew the egyptians in the midst of the sea .
so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicolaitans , which thing i hate .
and the lord said unto moses , stretch out thine hand over the sea , that the waters may come again upon the egyptians , upon their chariots , and upon their horsemen .
but i have a few things against thee , because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of balaam , who taught balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of israel , to eat things sacrificed unto idols , and to commit fornication .
and took off their chariot wheels , that they drave them heavily : so that the egyptians said , let us flee from the face of israel ; for the lord fighteth for them against the egyptians .
he that hath an ear , let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches ; he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death .
fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer : behold , the devil shall cast some of you into prison , that ye may be tried ; and ye shall have tribulation ten days : be thou faithful unto death , and i will give thee a crown of life .
and when pharaoh drew nigh , the children of israel lifted up their eyes , and , behold , the egyptians marched after them ; and they were sore afraid : and the children of israel cried out unto the lord .
is not this the word that we did tell thee in egypt , saying , let us alone , that we may serve the egyptians ? for it had been better for us to serve the egyptians , than that we should die in the wilderness .
and moses said unto the people , fear ye not , stand still , and see the salvation of the lord , which he will shew to you to day : for the egyptians whom ye have seen to day , ye shall see them again no more for ever .
and the lord said unto moses , wherefore criest thou unto me ? speak unto the children of israel , that they go forward :
the lord shall fight for you , and ye shall hold your peace .
but lift thou up thy rod , and stretch out thine hand over the sea , and divide it : and the children of israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea .
and the angel of god , which went before the camp of israel , removed and went behind them ; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face , and stood behind them :
and the egyptians shall know that i am the lord , when i have gotten me honour upon pharaoh , upon his chariots , and upon his horsemen .
and he commanded them , saying , behold , ye shall lie in wait against the city , even behind the city : go not very far from the city , but be ye all ready :
so joshua arose , and all the people of war , to go up against ai : and joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour , and sent them away by night .
and thou shalt do to ai and her king as thou didst unto jericho and her king : only the spoil thereof , and the cattle thereof , shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves : lay thee an ambush for the city behind it .
joshua therefore sent them forth : and they went to lie in ambush , and abode between bethel and ai , on the west side of ai : but joshua lodged that night among the people .
and it shall be , when ye have taken the city , that ye shall set the city on fire : according to the commandment of the lord shall ye do . see , i have commanded you .
then ye shall rise up from the ambush , and seize upon the city : for the lord your god will deliver it into your hand .
( for they will come out after us ) till we have drawn them from the city ; for they will say , they flee before us , as at the first : therefore we will flee before them .
ye shall fall by the sword ; i will judge you in the border of israel ; and ye shall know that i am the lord .
and it came to pass , when i prophesied , that pelatiah the son of benaiah died . then fell i down upon my face , and cried with a loud voice , and said , ah lord god ! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of israel ?
again the word of the lord came unto me , saying ,
these are they whom the lord commanded to divide the inheritance unto the children of israel in the land of canaan .
and ye shall know that i am the lord : for ye have not walked in my statutes , neither executed my judgments , but have done after the manners of the heathen that are round about you .
therefore say , thus saith the lord god ; i will even gather you from the people , and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered , and i will give you the land of israel .
and they shall come thither , and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence .
son of man , thy brethren , even thy brethren , the men of thy kindred , and all the house of israel wholly , are they unto whom the inhabitants of jerusalem have said , get you far from the lord : unto us is this land given in possession .
therefore say , thus saith the lord god ; although i have cast them far off among the heathen , and although i have scattered them among the countries , yet will i be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come .
and the lord said unto joshua , fear not , neither be thou dismayed : take all the people of war with thee , and arise , go up to ai : see , i have given into thy hand the king of ai , and his people , and his city , and his land :
and i will give them one heart , and i will put a new spirit within you ; and i will take the stony heart out of their flesh , and will give them an heart of flesh :
and of the tribe of the children of simeon , shemuel the son of ammihud .
and the prince of the tribe of the children of zebulun , elizaphan the son of parnach .
and the prince of the tribe of the children of issachar , paltiel the son of azzan .
and the prince of the tribe of the children of asher , ahihud the son of shelomi .
and the prince of the tribe of the children of naphtali , pedahel the son of ammihud .
of the tribe of benjamin , elidad the son of chislon .
the prince of the children of joseph , for the tribe of the children of manasseh , hanniel the son of ephod .
and the prince of the tribe of the children of ephraim , kemuel the son of shiphtan .
and the names of the men are these : of the tribe of judah , caleb the son of jephunneh .
and ye shall take one prince of every tribe , to divide the land by inheritance .
then all israel gathered themselves to david unto hebron , saying , behold , we are thy bone and thy flesh .
o come , let us sing unto the lord : let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation .
for the lord is a great god , and a great king above all gods .
let us come before his presence with thanksgiving , and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms .
the sea is his , and he made it : and his hands formed the dry land .
in his hand are the deep places of the earth : the strength of the hills is his also .
and david dwelt in the castle ; therefore they called it the city of david .
and david said , whosoever smiteth the jebusites first shall be chief and captain . so joab the son of zeruiah went first up , and was chief .
so david waxed greater and greater : for the lord of hosts was with him .
and he built the city round about , even from millo round about : and joab repaired the rest of the city .
therefore came all the elders of israel to the king to hebron ; and david made a covenant with them in hebron before the lord ; and they anointed david king over israel , according to the word of the lord by samuel .
and moreover in time past , even when saul was king , thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in israel : and the lord thy god said unto thee , thou shalt feed my people israel , and thou shalt be ruler over my people israel , and thou shalt be ruler over my people israel .
and the inhabitants of jebus said to david , thou shalt not come hither . nevertheless david took the castle of zion , which is the city of david .
and david and all israel went to jerusalem , which is jebus ; where the jebusites were , the inhabitants of the land .
why withdrawest thou thy hand , even thy right hand ? pluck it out of thy bosom .
o god , how long shall the adversary reproach ? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever ?
thou didst divide the sea by thy strength : thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters .
for god is my king of old , working salvation in the midst of the earth .
o deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked : forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever .
remember this , that the enemy hath reproached , o lord , and that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name .
thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood : thou driedst up mighty rivers .
thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces , and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness .
thou hast set all the borders of the earth : thou hast made summer and winter .
the day is thine , the night also is thine : thou hast prepared the light and the sun .
when the philistines took the ark of god , they brought it into the house of dagon , and set it by dagon .
and when they of ashdod arose early on the morrow , behold , dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the lord . and they took dagon , and set him in his place again .
and the philistines took the ark of god , and brought it from eben - ezer unto ashdod .
wherefore the rather , brethren , give diligence to make your calling and election sure : for if ye do these things , ye shall never fall :
yea , i think it meet , as long as i am in this tabernacle , to stir you up by putting you in remembrance ;
knowing that shortly i must put off this my tabernacle , even as our lord jesus christ hath shewed me .
for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and saviour jesus christ .
wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things , though ye know them , and be established in the present truth .
for he received from god the father honour and glory , when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory , this is my beloved son , in whom i am well pleased .
and this voice which came from heaven we heard , when we were with him in the holy mount .
moreover i will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance .
for we have not followed cunningly devised fables , when we made known unto you the power and coming of our lord jesus christ , but were eyewitnesses of his majesty .
and david and all the house of israel played before the lord on all manner of instruments made of fir wood , even on harps , and on psalteries , and on timbrels , and on cornets , and on cymbals .
and they brought it out of the house of abinadab which was at gibeah , accompanying the ark of god : and ahio went before the ark .
we have also a more sure word of prophecy ; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed , as unto a light that shineth in a dark place , until the day dawn , and the day star arise in your hearts :
and they set the ark of god upon a new cart , and brought it out of the house of abinadab that was in gibeah : and uzzah and ahio , the sons of abinadab , drave the new cart .
and david arose , and went with all the people that were with him from baale of judah , to bring up from thence the ark of god , whose name is called by the name of the lord of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims .
harden not your heart , as in the provocation , and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness :
and david was displeased , because the lord had made a breach upon uzzah : and he called the name of the place perez - uzzah to this day .
when your fathers tempted me , proved me , and saw my work .
and the anger of the lord was kindled against uzzah ; and god smote him there for his error ; and there he died by the ark of god .
o come , let us worship and bow down : let us kneel before the lord our maker .
and when they came to nachon ' s threshingfloor , uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of god , and took hold of it ; for the oxen shook it .
for he is our god ; and we are the people of his pasture , and the sheep of his hand . to day if ye will hear his voice ,
go ye up upon her walls , and destroy ; but make not a full end : take away her battlements ; for they are not the lord ' s .
they have belied the lord , and said , it is not he ; neither shall evil come upon us ; neither shall we see sword nor famine :
for the house of israel and the house of judah have dealt very treacherously against me , saith the lord .
wherefore thus saith the lord god of hosts , because ye speak this word , behold , i will make my words in thy mouth fire , and this people wood , and it shall devour them .
and they shall eat up thine harvest , and thy bread , which thy sons and thy daughters should eat : they shall eat up thy flocks and thine herds : they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees : they shall impoverish thy fenced cities , wherein thou trustedst , with the sword .
nevertheless in those days , saith the lord , i will not make a full end with you .
lo , i will bring a nation upon you from far , o house of israel , saith the lord : it is a mighty nation , it is an ancient nation , a nation whose language thou knowest not , neither understandest what they say .
their quiver is as an open sepulchre , they are all mighty men .
and it shall come to pass , when ye shall say , wherefore doeth the lord our god all these things unto us ? then shalt thou answer them , like as ye have forsaken me , and served strange gods in your land , so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not yours .
hear now this , o foolish people , and without understanding ; which have eyes , and see not ; which have ears , and hear not :
declare this in the house of jacob , and publish it in judah , saying ,
again , david gathered together all the chosen men of israel , thirty thousand .
your iniquities have turned away these things , and your sins have withholden good things from you .
neither say they in their heart , let us now fear the lord our god , that giveth rain , both the former and the latter , in his season : he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest .
but this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart ; they are revolted and gone .
for among my people are found wicked men : they lay wait , as he that setteth snares ; they set a trap , they catch men .
as a cage is full of birds , so are their houses full of deceit : therefore they are become great , and waxen rich .
they are waxen fat , they shine : yea , they overpass the deeds of the wicked : they judge not the cause , the cause of the fatherless , yet they prosper ; and the right of the needy do they not judge .
shall i not visit for these things ? saith the lord : shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this ?
a wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land ;
the prophets prophesy falsely , and the priests bear rule by their means ; and my people love to have it so : and what will ye do in the end thereof ?
none of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him , to uncover their nakedness : i am the lord .
the nakedness of thy father , or the nakedness of thy mother , shalt thou not uncover : she is thy mother ; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness .
the nakedness of thy father ' s wife shalt thou not uncover : it is thy father ' s nakedness .
speak unto the children of israel , and say unto them , i am the lord your god .
ye shall do my judgments , and keep mine ordinances , to walk therein : i am the lord your god .
ye shall therefore keep my statutes , and my judgments : which if a man do , he shall live in them : i am the lord .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
elihu spake moreover , and said ,
thinkest thou this to be right , that thou saidst , my righteousness is more than god ' s ?
look unto the heavens , and see ; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou .
if thou sinnest , what doest thou against him ? or if thy transgressions be multiplied , what doest thou unto him ?
for thou saidst , what advantage will it be unto thee ? and , what profit shall i have , if i be cleansed from my sin ?
i will answer thee , and thy companions with thee .
by reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry : they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty .
in the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles of wine ; he stretched out his hand with scorners .
for they have made ready their heart like an oven , whiles they lie in wait : their baker sleepeth all the night ; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire .
if thou be righteous , what givest thou him ? or what receiveth he of thine hand ?
they are all hot as an oven , and have devoured their judges ; all their kings are fallen : there is none among them that calleth unto me .
thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art ; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man .
ephraim , he hath mixed himself among the people ; ephraim is a cake not turned .
strangers have devoured his strength , and he knoweth it not : yea , gray hairs are here and there upon him , yet he knoweth not .
and they consider not in their hearts that i remember all their wickedness : now their own doings have beset them about ; they are before my face .
when i would have healed israel , then the iniquity of ephraim was discovered , and the wickedness of samaria : for they commit falsehood ; and the thief cometh in , and the troop of robbers spoileth without .
they are all adulterers , as an oven heated by the baker , who ceaseth from raising after he hath kneeded the dough , until it be leavened .
they make the king glad with their wickedness , and the princes with their lies .
and they said unto him , from a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the lord thy god : for we have heard the fame of him , and all that he did in egypt ,
that they gathered themselves together , to fight with joshua and with israel , with one accord .
and when the inhabitants of gibeon heard what joshua had done unto jericho and to ai ,
they did work wilily , and went and made as if they had been ambassadors , and took old sacks upon their asses , and wine bottles , old , and rent , and bound up ;
and old shoes and clouted upon their feet , and old garments upon them ; and all the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy .
and they went to joshua unto the camp at gilgal , and said unto him , and to the men of israel , we be come from a far country : now therefore make ye a league with us .
and the men of israel said unto the hivites , peradventure ye dwell among us ; and how shall we make a league with you ?
and they said unto joshua , we are thy servants . and joshua said unto them , who are ye ? and from whence come ye ?
and the next day we that were of paul ' s company departed , and came unto caesarea : and we entered into the house of philip the evangelist , which was one of the seven ; and abode with him .
and when we had finished our course from tyre , we came to ptolemais , and saluted the brethren , and abode with them one day .
and when we had accomplished those days , we departed and went our way ; and they all brought us on our way , with wives and children , till we were out of the city : and we kneeled down on the shore , and prayed .
and when we had taken our leave one of another , we took ship ; and they returned home again .
now when we had discovered cyprus , we left it on the left hand , and sailed into syria , and landed at tyre : for there the ship was to unlade her burden .
and finding disciples , we tarried there seven days : who said to paul through the spirit , that he should not go up to jerusalem .
and it came to pass , that after we were gotten from them , and had launched , we came with a straight course unto coos , and the day following unto rhodes , and from thence unto patara :
and finding a ship sailing over unto phenicia , we went aboard , and set forth .
who shall also confirm you unto the end , that ye may be blameless in the day of our lord jesus christ .
god is faithful , by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his son jesus christ our lord .
even as the testimony of christ was confirmed in you :
so that ye come behind in no gift ; waiting for the coming of our lord jesus christ :
i thank my god always on your behalf , for the grace of god which is given you by jesus christ ;
that in every thing ye are enriched by him , in all utterance , and in all knowledge ;
unto the church of god which is at corinth , to them that are sanctified in christ jesus , called to be saints , with all that in every place call upon the name of jesus christ our lord , both theirs and ours :
grace be unto you , and peace , from god our father , and from the lord jesus christ .
paul , called to be an apostle of jesus christ through the will of god , and sosthenes our brother ,
i love them that love me ; and those that seek me early shall find me .
by me princes rule , and nobles , even all the judges of the earth .
my fruit is better than gold , yea , than fine gold ; and my revenue than choice silver .
riches and honour are with me ; yea , durable riches and righteousness .
why should the name of our father be done away from among his family , because he hath no son ? give unto us therefore a possession among the brethren of our father .
our father died in the wilderness , and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the lord in the company of korah ; but died in his own sin , and had no sons .
and they stood before moses , and before eleazar the priest , and before the princes and all the congregation , by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , saying ,
for wisdom is better than rubies ; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it .
then came the daughters of zelophehad , the son of hepher , the son of gilead , the son of machir , the son of manasseh , of the families of manasseh the son of joseph : and these are the names of his daughters ; mahlah , noah , and hoglah , and milcah , and tirzah .
receive my instruction , and not silver ; and knowledge rather than choice gold .
the fear of the lord is to hate evil : pride , and arrogancy , and the evil way , and the froward mouth , do i hate .
i wisdom dwell with prudence , and find out knowledge of witty inventions .
by me kings reign , and princes decree justice .
counsel is mine , and sound wisdom : i am understanding ; i have strength .
and if he have no daughter , then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren .
and moses brought their cause before the lord .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
and they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places : thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations ; and thou shalt be called , the repairer of the breach , the restorer of paths to dwell in .
the daughters of zelophehad speak right : thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father ' s brethren ; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them .
if thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath , from doing thy pleasure on my holy day ; and call the sabbath a delight , the holy of the lord , honourable ; and shalt honour him , not doing thine own ways , nor finding thine own pleasure , nor speaking thine own words :
and thou shalt speak unto the children of israel , saying , if a man die , and have no son , then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter .
then shalt thou delight thyself in the lord ; and i will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth , and feed thee with the heritage of jacob thy father : for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it .
to him that made great lights : for his mercy endureth for ever :
to him that stretched out the earth above the waters : for his mercy endureth for ever .
the moon and stars to rule by night : for his mercy endureth for ever .
the sun to rule by day : for his mercy endureth for ever :
and if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry , and satisfy the afflicted soul ; then shall thy light rise in obscurity , and thy darkness be as the noonday :
to him who alone doeth great wonders : for his mercy endureth for ever .
to him that by wisdom made the heavens : for his mercy endureth for ever .
o give thanks unto the god of gods : for his mercy endureth for ever .
o give thanks to the lord of lords : for his mercy endureth for ever .
o give thanks unto the lord ; for he is good : for his mercy endureth for ever .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord , as his father manasseh did .
and the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king amon ; and the people of the land made josiah his son king in his stead .
and the servants of amon conspired against him , and slew the king in his own house .
and he forsook the lord god of his fathers , and walked not in the way of the lord .
and he walked in all the way that his father walked in , and served the idols that his father served , and worshipped them :
and david said unto ahimelech the priest , the king hath commanded me a business , and hath said unto me , let no man know any thing of the business whereabout i send thee , and what i have commanded thee : and i have appointed my servants to such and such a place .
now therefore what is under thine hand ? give me five loaves of bread in mine hand , or what there is present .
and he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of uzza : and josiah his son reigned in his stead .
now the rest of the acts of amon which he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah ?
then came david to nob to ahimelech the priest : and ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of david , and said unto him , why art thou alone , and no man with thee ?
and david said unto ahimelech , and is there not here under thine hand spear or sword ? for i have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me , because the king ' s business required haste .
and the priest answered david , and said , there is no common bread under mine hand , but there is hallowed bread ; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women .
now a certain man of the servants of saul was there that day , detained before the lord ; and his name was doeg , an edomite , the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to saul .
so the priest gave him hallowed bread : for there was no bread there but the shewbread , that was taken from before the lord , to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away .
because manasseh king of judah hath done these abominations , and hath done wickedly above all that the amorites did , which were before him , and hath made judah also to sin with his idols :
and i will stretch over jerusalem the line of samaria , and the plummet of the house of ahab : and i will wipe jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish , wiping it , and turning it upside down .
therefore thus saith the lord god of israel , behold , i am bringing such evil upon jerusalem and judah , that whosoever heareth of it , both his ears shall tingle .
because they have done that which was evil in my sight , and have provoked me to anger , since the day their fathers came forth out of egypt , even unto this day .
and i will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance , and deliver them into the hand of their enemies ; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies ;
now the rest of the acts of manasseh , and all that he did , and his sin that he sinned , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah ?
moreover manasseh shed innocent blood very much , till he had filled jerusalem from one end to another ; beside his sin wherewith he made judah to sin , in doing that which was evil in the sight of the lord .
amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign , and he reigned two years in jerusalem . and his mother ' s name was meshullemeth , the daughter of haruz of jotbah .
and manasseh slept with his fathers , and was buried in the garden of his own house , in the garden of uzza : and amon his son reigned in his stead .
thou shalt keep them , o lord , thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever .
the wicked walk on every side , when the vilest men are exalted .
for the oppression of the poor , for the sighing of the needy , now will i arise , saith the lord ; i will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him .
the words of the lord are pure words : as silver tried in a furnace of earth , purified seven times .
who have said , with our tongue will we prevail ; our lips are our own : who is lord over us ?
help , lord ; for the godly man ceaseth ; for the faithful fail from among the children of men .
they speak vanity every one with his neighbour : with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak .
blessed is the man that heareth me , watching daily at my gates , waiting at the posts of my doors .
then i was by him , as one brought up with him : and i was daily his delight , rejoicing always before him ;
rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth ; and my delights were with the sons of men .
now therefore hearken unto me , o ye children : for blessed are they that keep my ways .
hear instruction , and be wise , and refuse it not .
before the mountains were settled , before the hills was i brought forth :
while as yet he had not made the earth , nor the fields , nor the highest part of the dust of the world .
i was set up from everlasting , from the beginning , or ever the earth was .
that i may cause those that love me to inherit substance ; and i will fill their treasures .
the lord possessed me in the beginning of his way , before his works of old .
i lead in the way of righteousness , in the midst of the paths of judgment :
when he gave to the sea his decree , that the waters should not pass his commandment : when he appointed the foundations of the earth :
when he prepared the heavens , i was there : when he set a compass upon the face of the depth :
when he established the clouds above : when he strengthened the fountains of the deep :
then saith he to his servants , the wedding is ready , but they which were bidden were not worthy .
go ye therefore into the highways , and as many as ye shall find , bid to the marriage .
again , he sent forth other servants , saying , tell them which are bidden , behold , i have prepared my dinner : my oxen and my fatlings are killed , and all things are ready : come unto the marriage .
but they made light of it , and went their ways , one to his farm , another to his merchandise :
and the remnant took his servants , and entreated them spitefully , and slew them .
but when the king heard thereof , he was wroth : and he sent forth his armies , and destroyed those murderers , and burned up their city .
and god said , let the earth bring forth grass , the herb yielding seed , and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind , whose seed is in itself , upon the earth : and it was so .
and god called the dry land earth ; and the gathering together of the waters called he seas : and god saw that it was good .
and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth : and it was so .
and god said , let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night ; and let them be for signs , and for seasons , and for days , and years :
and the evening and the morning were the third day .
and the earth brought forth grass , and herb yielding seed after his kind , and the tree yielding fruit , whose seed was in itself , after his kind : and god saw that it was good .
and the evening and the morning were the fourth day .
and to rule over the day and over the night , and to divide the light from the darkness : and god saw that it was good .
and god set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth ,
and god made two great lights ; the greater light to rule the day , and the lesser light to rule the night : he made the stars also .
he will keep the feet of his saints , and the wicked shall be silent in darkness ; for by strength shall no man prevail .
he raiseth up the poor out of the dust , and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill , to set them among princes , and to make them inherit the throne of glory : for the pillars of the earth are the lord ' s , and he hath set the world upon them .
the lord maketh poor , and maketh rich : he bringeth low , and lifteth up .
and god said , let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life , and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven .
and god blessed them , saying , be fruitful , and multiply , and fill the waters in the seas , and let fowl multiply in the earth .
and god said , let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind , cattle , and creeping thing , and beast of the earth after his kind : and it was so .
and the evening and the morning were the fifth day .
and god said , let us make man in our image , after our likeness : and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea , and over the fowl of the air , and over the cattle , and over all the earth , and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth .
and god made the beast of the earth after his kind , and cattle after their kind , and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind : and god saw that it was good .
and god blessed them , and god said unto them , be fruitful , and multiply , and replenish the earth , and subdue it : and have dominion over the fish of the sea , and over the fowl of the air , and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth .
so god created man in his own image , in the image of god created he him ; male and female created he them .
and god said , behold , i have given you every herb bearing seed , which is upon the face of all the earth , and every tree , in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed ; to you it shall be for meat .
and achish said , whither have ye made a road to day ? and david said , against the south of judah , and against the south of the jerahmeelites , and against the south of the kenites .
and david saved neither man nor woman alive , to bring tidings to gath , saying , lest they should tell on us , saying , so did david , and so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the philistines .
and achish believed david , saying , he hath made his people israel utterly to abhor him ; therefore he shall be my servant for ever .
and god saw every thing that he had made , and , behold , it was very good . and the evening and the morning were the sixth day .
and to every beast of the earth , and to every fowl of the air , and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth , wherein there is life , i have given every green herb for meat : and it was so .
and hannah prayed , and said , my heart rejoiceth in the lord , mine horn is exalted in the lord : my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies ; because i rejoice in thy salvation .
there is none holy as the lord : for there is none beside thee : neither is there any rock like our god .
talk no more so exceeding proudly ; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth : for the lord is a god of knowledge , and by him actions are weighed .
the bows of the mighty men are broken , and they that stumbled are girded with strength .
they that were full have hired out themselves for bread ; and they that were hungry ceased : so that the barren hath born seven ; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble .
and jesus went out , and departed from the temple : and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple .
and when i come , whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters , them will i send to bring your liberality unto jerusalem .
upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store , as god hath prospered him , that there be no gatherings when i come .
for i will not see you now by the way ; but i trust to tarry a while with you , if the lord permit .
and it may be that i will abide , yea , and winter with you , that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever i go .
now i will come unto you , when i shall pass through macedonia : for i do pass through macedonia .
and if it be meet that i go also , they shall go with me .
ira the ithrite , gareb the ithrite ,
uriah the hittite , zabad the son of ahlai ,
for many shall come in my name , saying , i am christ ; and shall deceive many .
and jesus answered and said unto them , take heed that no man deceive you .
eliel the mahavite , and jeribai , and joshaviah , the sons of elnaam , and ithmah the moabite ,
and as he sat upon the mount of olives , the disciples came unto him privately , saying , tell us , when shall these things be ? and what shall be the sign of thy coming , and of the end of the world ?
eliel , and obed , and jasiel the mesobaite .
and jesus said unto them , see ye not all these things ? verily i say unto you , there shall not be left here one stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down .
uzzia the ashterathite , shama and jehiel the sons of hothan the aroerite ,
then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted , and shall kill you : and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name ' s sake .
jediael the son of shimri , and joha his brother , the tizite ,
all these are the beginning of sorrows .
adina the son of shiza the reubenite , a captain of the reubenites , and thirty with him ,
for nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom : and there shall be famines , and pestilences , and earthquakes , in divers places .
hanan the son of maachah , and joshaphat the mithnite ,
and ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars : see that ye be not troubled : for all these things must come to pass , but the end is not yet .
zelek the ammonite , naharai the berothite , the armourbearer of joab the son of zeruiah ,
the west side also shall be the great sea from the border , till a man come over against hamath . this is the west side .
in thee , o lord , do i put my trust ; let me never be ashamed : deliver me in thy righteousness .
bow down thine ear to me ; deliver me speedily : be thou my strong rock , for an house of defence to save me .
for thou art my rock and my fortress ; therefore for thy name ' s sake lead me , and guide me .
thus saith the lord god ; this shall be the border , whereby ye shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of israel : joseph shall have two portions .
and it shall come to pass , that the fishers shall stand upon it from en - gedi even unto en - eglaim ; they shall be a place to spread forth nets ; their fish shall be according to their kinds , as the fish of the great sea , exceeding many .
maharai the netophathite , heled the son of baanah the netophathite ,
but the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not be healed ; they shall be given to salt .
hamath , berothah , sibraim , which is between the border of damascus and the border of hamath ; hazar - hatticon , which is by the coast of hauran .
and the border from the sea shall be hazar - enan , the border of damascus , and the north northward , and the border of hamath . and this is the north side .
and ye shall inherit it , one as well as another : concerning the which i lifted up mine hand to give it unto your fathers : and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance .
and this shall be the border of the land toward the north side , from the great sea , the way of hethlon , as men go to zedad ;
ahiam the son of sacar the hararite , eliphal the son of ur ,
hepher the mecherathite , ahijah the pelonite ,
hezro the carmelite , naarai the son of ezbai ,
and the east side ye shall measure from hauran , and from damascus , and from gilead , and from the land of israel by jordan , from the border unto the east sea . and this is the east side .
joel the brother of nathan , mibhar the son of haggeri ,
and the south side southward , from tamar even to the waters of strife in kadesh , the river to the great sea . and this is the south side southward .
ithai the son of ribai of gibeah , that pertained to the children of benjamin , benaiah the pirathonite ,
hurai of the brooks of gaash , abiel the arbathite ,
azmaveth the baharumite , eliahba the shaalbonite ,
the sons of hashem the gizonite , jonathan the son of shage the hararite ,
sibbecai the hushathite , ilai the ahohite ,
ira the son of ikkesh the tekoite , abi - ezer the antothite ,
but the fearful , and unbelieving , and the abominable , and murderers , and whoremongers , and sorcerers , and idolaters , and all liars , shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone : which is the second death .
and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues , and talked with me , saying , come hither , i will shew thee the bride , the lamb ' s wife .
so shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of israel .
and it shall come to pass , that in what tribe the stranger sojourneth , there shall ye give him his inheritance , saith the lord god .
and abishai the brother of joab , he was chief of the three : for lifting up his spear against three hundred , he slew them , and had a name among the three .
of the three , he was more honourable than the two ; for he was their captain : howbeit he attained not to the first three .
also the valiant men of the armies were , asahel the brother of joab , elhanan the son of dodo of bethlehem ,
shammoth the harorite , helez the pelonite ,
these things did benaiah the son of jehoiada , and had the name among the three mighties .
behold , he was honourable among the thirty , but attained not to the first three : and david set him over his guard .
and the three brake through the host of the philistines , and drew water out of the well of bethlehem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to david : but david would not drink of it , but poured it out to the lord ,
and david longed , and said , oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of bethlehem , that is at the gate !
and said , my god forbid it me , that i should do this thing : shall i drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy ? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it . therefore he would not drink it . these things did these three mightiest .
and he that sat upon the throne said , behold , i make all things new . and he said unto me , write : for these words are true and faithful .
these also are the chief of the mighty men whom david had , who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom , and with all israel , to make him king , according to the word of the lord concerning israel .
he that overcometh shall inherit all things ; and i will be his god , and he shall be my son .
and this is the number of the mighty men whom david had ; jashobeam , and hachmonite , the chief of the captains : he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time .
and he said unto me , it is done . i am alpha and omega , the beginning and the end . i will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely .
and after him was eleazar the son of dodo , the ahohite , who was one of the three mighties .
and i saw a new heaven and a new earth : for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away ; and there was no more sea .
he was with david at pas - dammim , and there the philistines were gathered together to battle , where was a parcel of ground full of barley ; and the people fled from before the philistines .
and they set themselves in the midst of that parcel , and delivered it , and slew the philistines ; and the lord saved them by a great deliverance .
and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying , behold , the tabernacle of god is with men , and he will dwell with them , and they shall be his people , and god himself shall be with them , and be their god .
now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to david , into the cave of adullam ; and the host of the philistines encamped in the valley of rephaim .
and i john saw the holy city , new jerusalem , coming down from god out of heaven , prepared as a bride adorned for her husband .
and david was then in the hold , and the philistines ' garrison was then at bethlehem .
thus saith the lord , keep ye judgment , and do justice : for my salvation is near to come , and my righteousness to be revealed .
how long shall they utter and speak hard things ? and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves ?
even them will i bring to my holy mountain , and make them joyful in my house of prayer : their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar ; for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people .
lord , how long shall the wicked , how long shall the wicked triumph ?
also the sons of the stranger , that join themselves to the lord , to serve him , and to love the name of the lord , to be his servants , every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it , and taketh hold of my covenant ;
they slay the widow and the stranger , and murder the fatherless .
all ye beasts of the field , come to devour , yea , all ye beasts in the forest .
they break in pieces thy people , o lord , and afflict thine heritage .
the lord god which gathereth the outcasts of israel saith , yet will i gather others to him , beside those that are gathered unto him .
neither let the son of the stranger , that hath joined himself to the lord , speak , saying , the lord hath utterly separated me from his people : neither let the eunuch say , behold , i am a dry tree .
blessed is the man that doeth this , and the son of man that layeth hold on it ; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it , and keepeth his hand from doing any evil .
lift up thyself , thou judge of the earth : render a reward to the proud .
even unto them will i give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters : i will give them an everlasting name , that shall not be cut off .
o lord god , to whom vengeance belongeth ; o god , to whom vengeance belongeth , shew thyself .
for thus saith the lord unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths , and choose the things that please me , and take hold of my covenant ;
they eat up the sin of my people , and they set their heart on their iniquity .
and there shall be , like people , like priest : and i will punish them for their ways , and reward them their doings .
therefore shall the land mourn , and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish , with the beasts of the field , and with the fowls of heaven ; yea , the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away .
by swearing , and lying , and killing , and stealing , and committing adultery , they break out , and blood toucheth blood .
hear the word of the lord , ye children of israel : for the lord hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land , because there is no truth , nor mercy , nor knowledge of god in the land .
as they were increased , so they sinned against me : therefore will i change their glory into shame .
my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge : because thou hast rejected knowledge , i will also reject thee , that thou shalt be no priest to me : seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy god , i will also forget thy children .
therefore shalt thou fall in the day , and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night , and i will destroy thy mother .
yet let no man strive , nor reprove another : for thy people are as they that strive with the priest .
for what portion of god is there from above ? and what inheritance of the almighty from on high ?
i made a covenant with mine eyes ; why then should i think upon a maid ?
then let me sow , and let another eat ; yea , let my offspring be rooted out .
if mine heart have been deceived by a woman , or if i have laid wait at my neighbour ' s door ;
but none saith , where is god my maker , who giveth songs in the night ;
is not destruction to the wicked ? and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity ?
doth not he see my ways , and count all my steps ?
if i have walked with vanity , or if my foot hath hasted to deceit ;
let me be weighed in an even balance , that god may know mine integrity .
o my dove , that art in the clefts of the rock , in the secret places of the stairs , let me see thy countenance , let me hear thy voice ; for sweet is thy voice , and thy countenance is comely .
the flowers appear on the earth ; the time of the singing of birds is come , and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land ;
for , lo , the winter is past , the rain is over and gone ;
there they cry , but none giveth answer , because of the pride of evil men .
my beloved spake , and said unto me , rise up , my love , my fair one , and come away .
surely god will not hear vanity , neither will the almighty regard it .
although thou sayest thou shalt not see him , yet judgment is before him ; therefore trust thou in him .
but now , because it is not so , he hath visited in his anger ; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity :
until the day break , and the shadows flee away , turn , my beloved , and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of bether .
my beloved is mine , and i am his : he feedeth among the lilies .
take us the foxes , the little foxes , that spoil the vines : for our vines have tender grapes .
and unto david were sons born in hebron : and his firstborn was amnon , of ahinoam the jezreelitess ;
now there was long war between the house of saul and the house of david : but david waxed stronger and stronger , and the house of saul waxed weaker and weaker .
and the fourth , adonijah the son of haggith ; and the fifth , shephatiah the son of abital ;
and the lord spake unto the fish , and it vomited out jonah upon the dry land .
and his second , chileab , of abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite ; and the third , absalom the son of maacah the daughter of talmai king of geshur ;
but the children of israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing : for achan , the son of carmi , the son of zabdi , the son of zerah , of the tribe of judah , took of the accursed thing : and the anger of the lord was kindled against the children of israel .
and joshua sent men from jericho to ai , which is beside beth - aven , on the east side of bethel , and spake unto them , saying , go up and view the country . and the men went up and viewed ai .
and all the men of judah answered the men of israel , because the king is near of kin to us : wherefore then be ye angry for this matter ? have we eaten at all of the king ' s cost ? or hath he given us any gift ?
and , behold , all the men of israel came to the king , and said unto the king , why have our brethren the men of judah stolen thee away , and have brought the king , and his household , and all david ' s men with him , over jordan ?
then the king went on to gilgal , and chimham went on with him : and all the people of judah conducted the king , and also half the people of israel .
o lord , truly i am thy servant ; i am thy servant , and the son of thine handmaid : thou hast loosed my bonds .
precious in the sight of the lord is the death of his saints .
i will pay my vows unto the lord now in the presence of all his people ,
i will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving , and will call upon the name of the lord .
in the courts of the lord ' s house , in the midst of thee , o jerusalem . praise ye the lord .
for the canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it , and shall environ us round , and cut off our name from the earth : and what wilt thou do unto thy great name ?
o lord , what shall i say , when israel turneth their backs before their enemies !
i believed , therefore have i spoken : i was greatly afflicted :
and joshua said , alas , o lord god , wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over jordan , to deliver us into the hand of the amorites , to destroy us ? would to god we had been content , and dwelt on the other side jordan !
and joshua rent his clothes , and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the lord until the eventide , he and the elders of israel , and put dust upon their heads .
what shall i render unto the lord for all his benefits toward me ?
and the men of ai smote of them about thirty and six men : for they chased them from before the gate even unto shebarim , and smote them in the going down : wherefore the hearts of the people melted , and became as water .
i said in my haste , all men are liars .
so there went up thither of the people about three thousand men : and they fled before the men of ai .
i will pay my vows unto the lord now in the presence of all his people .
and they returned to joshua , and said unto him , let not all the people go up ; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite ai ; and make not all the people to labour thither ; for they are but few .
i will take the cup of salvation , and call upon the name of the lord .
he that planted the ear , shall he not hear ? he that formed the eye , shall he not see ?
so do god to abner , and more also , except , as the lord hath sworn to david , even so i do to him ;
understand , ye brutish among the people : and ye fools , when will ye be wise ?
yet they say , the lord shall not see , neither shall the god of jacob regard it .
and saul had a concubine , whose name was rizpah , the daughter of aiah : and ish - bosheth said to abner , wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father ' s concubine ?
and the sixth , ithream , by eglah david ' s wife . these were born to david in hebron .
and it came to pass , while there was war between the house of saul and the house of david , that abner made himself strong for the house of saul .
and ibhar , and elishua , and elpalet ,
now these are the names of his children which he had in jerusalem ; shammua , and shobab , nathan , and solomon ,
and david took more wives at jerusalem : and david begat more sons and daughters .
and david perceived that the lord had confirmed him king over israel , for his kingdom was lifted up on high , because of his people israel .
now hiram king of tyre sent messengers to david , and timber of cedars , with masons and carpenters , to build him an house .
and the philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of rephaim .
and elishama , and beeliada , and eliphalet .
and when the philistines heard that david was anointed king over all israel , all the philistines went up to seek david . and david heard of it , and went out against them .
we hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof .
by the rivers of babylon , there we sat down , yea , we wept , when we remembered zion .
how shall we sing the lord ' s song in a strange land ?
for there they that carried us away captive required of us a song ; and they that wasted us required of us mirth , saying , sing us one of the songs of zion .
speak unto all the congregation of the children of israel , and say unto them , ye shall be holy : for i the lord your god am holy .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
turn ye not unto idols , nor make to yourselves molten gods : i am the lord your god .
ye shall fear every man his mother , and his father , and keep my sabbaths : i am the lord your god .
it shall be eaten the same day ye offer it , and on the morrow : and if ought remain until the third day , it shall be burnt in the fire .
and if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the lord , ye shall offer it at your own will .
therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity , because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the lord : and that soul shall be cut off from among his people .
and when ye reap the harvest of your land , thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field , neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest .
and there went up with him both chariots and horsemen : and it was a very great company .
for the lord brought judah low because of ahaz king of israel ; for he made judah naked , and transgressed sore against the lord .
and joseph fell upon his father ' s face , and wept upon him , and kissed him .
the philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country , and of the south of judah , and had taken beth - shemesh , and ajalon , and gederoth , and shocho with the villages thereof , and timnah with the villages thereof , gimzo also and the villages thereof : and they dwelt there .
and joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father : and the physicians embalmed israel .
and when the days of his mourning were past , joseph spake unto the house of pharaoh , saying , if now i have found grace in your eyes , speak , i pray you , in the ears of pharaoh , saying ,
my father made me swear , saying , lo , i die : in my grave which i have digged for me in the land of canaan , there shalt thou bury me . now therefore let me go up , i pray thee , and bury my father , and i will come again .
so the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation .
and pharaoh said , go up , and bury thy father , according as he made thee swear .
for again the edomites had come and smitten judah , and carried away captives .
and joseph went up to bury his father : and with him went up all the servants of pharaoh , the elders of his house , and all the elders of the land of egypt ,
at that time did king ahaz send unto the kings of assyria to help him .
and all the house of joseph , and his brethren , and his father ' s house : only their little ones , and their flocks , and their herds , they left in the land of goshen .
now hear me therefore , and deliver the captives again , which ye have taken captive of your brethren : for the fierce wrath of the lord is upon you .
and now ye purpose to keep under the children of judah and jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you : but are there not with you , even with you , sins against the lord your god ?
and said unto them , ye shall not bring in the captives hither : for whereas we have offended against the lord already , ye intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass : for our trespass is great , and there is fierce wrath against israel .
then certain of the heads of the children of ephraim , azariah the son of johanan , berechiah the son of meshillemoth , and jehizkiah the son of shallum , and amasa the son of hadlai , stood up against them that came from the war ,
but samuel ministered before the lord , being a child , girded with a linen ephod .
moreover his mother made him a little coat , and brought it to him from year to year , when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice .
and they drave not out the canaanites that dwelt in gezer : but the canaanites dwell among the ephraimites unto this day , and serve under tribute .
and if any man said unto him , let them not fail to burn the fat presently , and then take as much as thy soul desireth ; then he would answer him , nay ; but thou shalt give it me now : and if not , i will take it by force .
wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the lord : for men abhorred the offering of the lord .
and he struck it into the pan , or kettle , or caldron , or pot ; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself . so they did in shiloh unto all the israelites that came thither .
also before they burnt the fat , the priest ' s servant came , and said to the man that sacrificed , give flesh to roast for the priest ; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee , but raw .
now the sons of eli were sons of belial ; they knew not the lord .
and the priests ' custom with the people was , that , when any man offered sacrifice , the priest ' s servant came , while the flesh was in seething , with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand ;
the adversaries of the lord shall be broken to pieces ; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them : the lord shall judge the ends of the earth ; and he shall give strength unto his king , and exalt the horn of his anointed .
and elkanah went to ramah to his house . and the child did minister unto the lord before eli the priest .
and he said unto them , why do ye such things ? for i hear of your evil dealings by all this people .
nay , my sons ; for it is no good report that i hear : ye make the lord ' s people to transgress .
if one man sin against another , the judge shall judge him : but if a man sin against the lord , who shall intreat for him ? notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father , because the lord would slay them .
and the child samuel grew on , and was in favour both with the lord , and also with men .
and did i choose him out of all the tribes of israel to be my priest , to offer upon mine altar , to burn incense , to wear an ephod before me ? and did i give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of israel ?
wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering , which i have commanded in my habitation ; and honourest thy sons above me , to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of israel my people ?
and the lord visited hannah , so that she conceived , and bare three sons and two daughters . and the child samuel grew before the lord .
and ahaz slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city , even in jerusalem : but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of israel : and hezekiah his son reigned in his stead .
now the rest of his acts and of all his ways , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of judah and israel .
and this shall be a sign unto thee , that shall come upon thy two sons , on hophni and phinehas ; in one day they shall die both of them .
and in every several city of judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods , and provoked to anger the lord god of his fathers .
and i will raise me up a faithful priest , that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind : and i will build him a sure house ; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever .
and tilgath - pilneser king of assyria came unto him , and distressed him , but strengthened him not .
and ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of god , and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of god , and shut up the doors of the house of the lord , and he made him altars in every corner of jerusalem .
and thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation , in all the wealth which god shall give israel : and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever .
for he sacrificed unto the gods of damascus , which smote him : and he said , because the gods of the kings of syria help them , therefore will i sacrifice to them , that they may help me . but they were the ruin of him , and of all israel .
and the man of thine , whom i shall not cut off from mine altar , shall be to consume thine eyes , and to grieve thine heart : and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age .
and in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the lord : this is that king ahaz .
wherefore the lord god of israel saith , i said indeed that thy house , and the house of thy father , should walk before me for ever : but now the lord saith , be it far from me ; for them that honour me i will honour , and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed .
for ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the lord , and out of the house of the king , and of the princes , and gave it unto the king of assyria : but he helped him not .
behold , the days come , that i will cut off thine arm , and the arm of thy father ' s house , that there shall not be an old man in thine house .
but i beseech you the rather to do this , that i may be restored to you the sooner .
pray for us : for we trust we have a good conscience , in all things willing to live honestly .
obey them that have the rule over you , and submit yourselves : for they watch for your souls , as they that must give account , that they may do it with joy , and not with grief : for that is unprofitable for you .
but to do good and to communicate forget not : for with such sacrifices god is well pleased .
by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to god continually , that is , the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name .
for here have we no continuing city , but we seek one to come .
let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp , bearing his reproach .
wherefore jesus also , that he might sanctify the people with his own blood , suffered without the gate .
for the bodies of those beasts , whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin , are burned without the camp .
we have an altar , whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle .
thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man : thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues .
blessed be the lord : for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city .
be of good courage , and he shall strengthen your heart , all ye that hope in the lord .
for i said in my haste , i am cut off from before thine eyes : nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when i cried unto thee .
o love the lord , all ye his saints : for the lord preserveth the faithful , and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer .
and it came to pass after the plague , that the lord spake unto moses and unto eleazar the son of aaron the priest , saying ,
take the sum of the people , from twenty years old and upward ; as the lord commanded moses and the children of israel , which went forth out of the land of egypt .
reuben , the eldest son of israel : the children of reuben ; hanoch , of whom cometh the family of the hanochites : of pallu , the family of the palluites :
take the sum of all the congregation of the children of israel , from twenty years old and upward , throughout their father ' s house , all that are able to go to war in israel .
and moses and eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of moab by jordan near jericho , saying ,
these are the families of the reubenites : and they that were numbered of them were forty and three thousand and seven hundred and thirty .
of hezron , the family of the hezronites : of carmi , the family of the carmites .
and the sons of eliab ; nemuel , and dathan , and abiram . this is that dathan and abiram , which were famous in the congregation , who strove against moses and against aaron in the company of korah , when they strove against the lord :
and the sons of pallu ; eliab .
salute all them that have the rule over you , and all the saints . they of italy salute you .
know ye that our brother timothy is set at liberty ; with whom , if he come shortly , i will see you .
grace be with you all . amen .
now the god of peace , that brought again from the dead our lord jesus , that great shepherd of the sheep , through the blood of the everlasting covenant ,
and i will shew wonders in heaven above , and signs in the earth beneath ; blood , and fire , and vapour of smoke :
for my life is spent with grief , and my years with sighing : my strength faileth because of mine iniquity , and my bones are consumed .
and it shall come to pass in the last days , saith god , i will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh : and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy , and your young men shall see visions , and your old men shall dream dreams :
i was a reproach among all mine enemies , but especially among my neighbours , and a fear to mine acquaintance : they that did see me without fled from me .
and on my servants and on my handmaidens i will pour out in those days of my spirit ; and they shall prophesy :
i am forgotten as a dead man out of mind : i am like a broken vessel .
for these are not drunken , as ye suppose , seeing it is but the third hour of the day .
for i have heard the slander of many : fear was on every side : while they took counsel together against me , they devised to take away my life .
but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel ;
but i trusted in thee , o lord : i said , thou art my god .
others mocking said , these men are full of new wine .
my times are in thy hand : deliver me from the hand of mine enemies , and from them that persecute me .
but peter , standing up with the eleven , lifted up his voice , and said unto them , ye men of judaea , and all ye that dwell at jerusalem , be this known unto you , and hearken to my words :
make thy face to shine upon thy servant : save me for thy mercies ' sake .
cretes and arabians , we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of god .
let me not be ashamed , o lord ; for i have called upon thee : let the wicked be ashamed , and let them be silent in the grave .
let the lying lips be put to silence ; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous .
oh how great is thy goodness , which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee ; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men !
phrygia , and pamphylia , in egypt , and in the parts of libya about cyrene , and strangers of rome , jews and proselytes ,
and the priest said unto them , go in peace : before the lord is your way wherein ye go .
and they came unto their brethren to zorah and eshtaol : and their brethren said unto them , what say ye ?
and they said , arise , that we may go up against them : for we have seen the land , and , behold , it is very good : and are ye still ? be not slothful to go , and to enter to possess the land .
and he said unto them , thus and thus dealeth micah with me , and hath hired me , and i am his priest .
and they said unto him , ask counsel , we pray thee , of god , that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous .
in those days there was no king in israel : and in those days the tribe of the danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in ; for unto that day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of israel .
pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me : for thou art my strength .
into thine hand i commit my spirit : thou hast redeemed me , o lord god of truth .
i have hated them that regard lying vanities : but i trust in the lord .
i will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy : for thou hast considered my trouble ; thou hast known my soul in adversities ;
and hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy : thou hast set my feet in a large room .
have mercy upon me , o lord , for i am in trouble : mine eye is consumed with grief , yea , my soul and my belly .
and sold their possessions and goods , and parted them to all men , as every man had need .
and all that believed were together , and had all things common ;
praising god , and having favour with all the people . and the lord added to the church daily such as should be saved .
and they , continuing daily with one accord in the temple , and breaking bread from house to house , did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart ,
then they that gladly received his word were baptized : and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls .
and with many other words did he testify and exhort , saying , save yourselves from this untoward generation .
and the decree of esther confirmed these matters of purim ; and it was written in the book .
and fear came upon every soul : and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles .
and they continued stedfastly in the apostles ' doctrine and fellowship , and in breaking of bread , and in prayers .
to confirm these days of purim in their times appointed , according as mordecai the jew and esther the queen had enjoined them , and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed , the matters of the fastings and their cry .
and he sent the letters unto all the jews , to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of ahasuerus , with words of peace and truth ,
happy shall he be , that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones .
if i do not remember thee , let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth ; if i prefer not jerusalem above my chief joy .
if i forget thee , o jerusalem , let my right hand forget her cunning .
o daughter of babylon , who art to be destroyed ; happy shall he be , that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us .
remember , o lord , the children of edom in the day of jerusalem ; who said , rase it , rase it , even to the foundation thereof .
but the jews that were at shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof ; and on the fourteenth thereof ; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested , and made it a day of feasting and gladness .
on that day the number of those that were slain in shushan the palace was brought before the king .
the ten sons of haman the son of hammedatha , the enemy of the jews , slew they ; but on the spoil laid they not their hand .
and it shall come to pass , that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved .
then said esther , if it please the king , let it be granted to the jews which are in shushan to do tomorrow also according unto this day ' s decree , and let haman ' s ten sons be hanged upon the gallows .
the sun shall be turned into darkness , and the moon into blood , before that great and notable day of the lord come :
him , being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of god , ye have taken , and by wicked hands have crucified and slain :
for the jews that were in shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month adar , and slew three hundred men at shushan ; but on the prey they laid not their hand .
ye men of israel , hear these words ; jesus of nazareth , a man approved of god among you by miracles and wonders and signs , which god did by him in the midst of you , as ye yourselves also know :
and the king commanded it so to be done : and the decree was given at shushan ; and they hanged haman ' s ten sons .
for david speaketh concerning him , i foresaw the lord always before my face , for he is on my right hand , that i should not be moved :
on the thirteenth day of the month adar ; and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they , and made it a day of feasting and gladness .
whom god hath raised up , having loosed the pains of death : because it was not possible that he should be holden of it .
but the other jews that were in the king ' s provinces gathered themselves together , and stood for their lives , and had rest from their enemies , and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand , but they laid not their hands on the prey ,
because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell , neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption .
therefore did my heart rejoice , and my tongue was glad ; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope :
men and brethren , let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch david , that he is both dead and buried , and his sepulchre is with us unto this day .
thou hast made known to me the ways of life ; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance .
so hannah rose up after they had eaten in shiloh , and after they had drunk . now eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the lord .
then esther the queen , the daughter of abihail , and mordecai the jew , wrote with all authority , to confirm this second letter of purim .
but if thou shalt forbear to vow , it shall be no sin in thee .
because haman the son of hammedatha , the agagite , the enemy of all the jews , had devised against the jews to destroy them , and had cast pur , that is , the lot , to consume them , and to destroy them ;
he seeing this before spake of the resurrection of christ , that his soul was not left in hell , neither his flesh did see corruption .
and the jews undertook to do as they had begun , and as mordecai had written unto them ;
therefore being a prophet , and knowing that god had sworn with an oath to him , that of the fruit of his loins , according to the flesh , he would raise up christ to sit on his throne ;
unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury ; but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon usury : that the lord thy god may bless thee in all that thou settest thine hand to in the land whither thou goest to possess it .
as the days wherein the jews rested from their enemies , and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy , and from mourning into a good day : that they should make them days of feasting and joy , and of sending portions one to another , and gifts to the poor .
to stablish this among them , that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month adar , and the fifteenth day of the same , yearly ,
therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly , that god hath made that same jesus , whom ye have crucified , both lord and christ .
and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation , every family , every province , and every city ; and that these days of purim should not fail from among the jews , nor the memorial of them perish from their seed .
until i make thy foes thy footstool .
the jews ordained , and took upon them , and upon their seed , and upon all such as joined themselves unto them , so as it should not fail , that they would keep these two days according to their writing , and according to their appointed time every year ;
for david is not ascended into the heavens : but he saith himself , the lord said unto my lord , sit thou on my right hand ,
wherefore they called these days purim after the name of pur . therefore for all the words of this letter , and of that which they had seen concerning this matter , and which had come unto them ,
therefore being by the right hand of god exalted , and having received of the father the promise of the holy ghost , he hath shed forth this , which ye now see and hear .
but when esther came before the king , he commanded by letters that his wicked device , which he devised against the jews , should return upon his own head , and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows .
for the promise is unto you , and to your children , and to all that are afar off , even as many as the lord our god shall call .
then peter said unto them , repent , and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins , and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost .
now when they heard this , they were pricked in their heart , and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles , men and brethren , what shall we do ?
and mordecai wrote these things , and sent letters unto all the jews that were in all the provinces of the king ahasuerus , both nigh and far ,
when thou comest into the standing corn of thy neighbour , then thou mayest pluck the ears with thine hand ; but thou shalt not move a sickle unto thy neighbour ' s standing corn .
when thou comest into thy neighbour ' s vineyard , then thou mayest eat grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure ; but thou shalt not put any in thy vessel .
and thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment the urim and the thummim ; and they shall be upon aaron ' s heart , when he goeth in before the lord : and aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of israel upon his heart before the lord continually .
and thou shalt make the robe of the ephod all of blue .
son of man , set thy face against zidon , and prophesy against it ,
and there shall be an hole in the top of it , in the midst thereof : it shall have a binding of woven work round about the hole of it , as it were the hole of an habergeon , that it be not rent .
again the word of the lord came unto me , saying ,
and beneath upon the hem of it thou shalt make pomegranates of blue , and of purple , and of scarlet , round about the hem thereof ; and bells of gold between them round about :
for i will send into her pestilence , and blood into her streets ; and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the sword upon her on every side ; and they shall know that i am the lord .
a golden bell and a pomegranate , a golden bell and a pomegranate , upon the hem of the robe round about .
and say , thus saith the lord god ; behold , i am against thee , o zidon ; and i will be glorified in the midst of thee : and they shall know that i am the lord , when i shall have executed judgments in her , and shall be sanctified in her .
and it shall be upon aaron to minister : and his sound shall be heard when he goeth in unto the holy place before the lord , and when he cometh out , that he die not .
and thou shalt make a plate of pure gold , and grave upon it , like the engravings of a signet , holiness to the lord .
and thou shalt put it on a blue lace , that it may be upon the mitre ; upon the forefront of the mitre it shall be .
and it shall be upon aaron ' s forehead , that aaron may bear the iniquity of the holy things , which the children of israel shall hallow in all their holy gifts ; and it shall be always upon his forehead , that they may be accepted before the lord .
therefore eli said unto samuel , go , lie down : and it shall be , if he call thee , that thou shalt say , speak , lord ; for thy servant heareth . so samuel went and lay down in his place .
and the lord called samuel again the third time . and he arose and went to eli , and said , here am i ; for thou didst call me . and eli perceived that the lord had called the child .
and thou shalt embroider the coat of fine linen , and thou shalt make the mitre of fine linen , and thou shalt make the girdle of needlework .
thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities , by the iniquity of thy traffick ; therefore will i bring forth a fire from the midst of thee , it shall devour thee , and i will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee .
now samuel did not yet know the lord , neither was the word of the lord yet revealed unto him .
all they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee : thou shalt be a terror , and never shalt thou be any more .
and the lord called yet again , samuel . and samuel arose and went to eli , and said , here am i ; for thou didst call me . and he answered , i called not , my son ; lie down again .
thou art the anointed cherub that covereth ; and i have set thee so : thou wast upon the holy mountain of god ; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire .
thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created , till iniquity was found in thee .
but the wise answered , saying , not so ; lest there be not enough for us and you : but go ye rather to them that sell , and buy for yourselves .
by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence , and thou hast sinned : therefore i will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of god : and i will destroy thee , o covering cherub , from the midst of the stones of fire .
then all those virgins arose , and trimmed their lamps .
and the foolish said unto the wise , give us of your oil ; for our lamps are gone out .
while the bridegroom tarried , they all slumbered and slept .
and at midnight there was a cry made , behold , the bridegroom cometh ; go ye out to meet him .
they that were foolish took their lamps , and took no oil with them :
but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps .
then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins , which took their lamps , and went forth to meet the bridegroom .
and five of them were wise , and five were foolish .
and immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness .
and he was there in the wilderness forty days , tempted of satan ; and was with the wild beasts ; and the angels ministered unto him .
and straightway coming up out of the water , he saw the heavens opened , and the spirit like a dove descending upon him :
and there came a voice from heaven , saying , thou art my beloved son , in whom i am well pleased .
and for aaron ' s sons thou shalt make coats , and thou shalt make for them girdles , and bonnets shalt thou make for them , for glory and for beauty .
now as he walked by the sea of galilee , he saw simon and andrew his brother casting a net into the sea : for they were fishers .
and thou shalt put them upon aaron thy brother , and his sons with him ; and shalt anoint them , and consecrate them , and sanctify them , that they may minister unto me in the priest ' s office .
and jesus said unto them , come ye after me , and i will make you to become fishers of men .
now after that john was put in prison , jesus came into galilee , preaching the gospel of the kingdom of god ,
and saying , the time is fulfilled , and the kingdom of god is at hand : repent ye , and believe the gospel .
and thou shalt make them linen breeches to cover their nakedness ; from the loins even unto the thighs they shall reach :
and they shall dwell safely therein , and shall build houses , and plant vineyards ; yea , they shall dwell with confidence , when i have executed judgments upon all those that despise them round about them ; and they shall know that i am the lord their god .
and there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of israel , nor any grieving thorn of all that are round about them , that despised them ; and they shall know that i am the lord god .
thus saith the lord god ; when i shall have gathered the house of israel from the people among whom they are scattered , and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen , then shall they dwell in their land that i have given to my servant jacob .
and jesus rebuked him , saying , hold thy peace , and come out of him .
and when the unclean spirit had torn him , and cried with a loud voice , he came out of him .
and they were all amazed , insomuch that they questioned among themselves , saying , what thing is this ? what new doctrine is this ? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits , and they do obey him .
whom i perceived to be accused of questions of their law , but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds .
and when i would have known the cause wherefore they accused him , i brought him forth into their council :
and they went into capernaum ; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue , and taught .
this man was taken of the jews , and should have been killed of them : then came i with an army , and rescued him , having understood that he was a roman .
and they were astonished at his doctrine : for he taught them as one that had authority , and not as the scribes .
claudius lysias unto the most excellent governor felix sendeth greeting .
and there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit ; and he cried out ,
and he wrote a letter after this manner :
saying , let us alone ; what have we to do with thee , thou jesus of nazareth ? art thou come to destroy us ? i know thee who thou art , the holy one of god .
and provide them beasts , that they may set paul on , and bring him safe unto felix the governor .
and he called unto him two centurions , saying , make ready two hundred soldiers to go to caesarea , and horsemen threescore and ten , and spearmen two hundred , at the third hour of the night ;
so the chief captain then let the young man depart , and charged him , see thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me .
but do not thou yield unto them : for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men , which have bound themselves with an oath , that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him : and now are they ready , looking for a promise from thee .
and straightway he called them : and they left their father zebedee in the ship with the hired servants , and went after him .
and he said , the jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down paul to morrow into the council , as though they would inquire somewhat of him more perfectly .
the spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity ; but a wounded spirit who can bear ?
the heart of the prudent getteth knowledge ; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge .
a man ' s gift maketh room for him , and bringeth him before great men .
and when he had gone a little further thence , he saw james the son of zebedee , and john his brother , who also were in the ship mending their nets .
the name of the lord is a strong tower : the righteous runneth into it , and is safe .
and straightway they forsook their nets , and followed him .
the rich man ' s wealth is his strong city , and as an high wall in his own conceit .
before destruction the heart of man is haughty , and before honour is humility .
and he said unto them , let us go into the next towns , that i may preach there also : for therefore came i forth .
and he preached in their synagogues throughout all galilee , and cast out devils .
and simon and they that were with him followed after him .
and when they had found him , they said unto him , all men seek for thee .
and he healed many that were sick of divers diseases , and cast out many devils ; and suffered not the devils to speak , because they knew him .
a brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city : and their contentions are like the bars of a castle .
and in the morning , rising up a great while before day , he went out , and departed into a solitary place , and there prayed .
the lot causeth contentions to cease , and parteth between the mighty .
and at even , when the sun did set , they brought unto him all that were diseased , and them that were possessed with devils .
he that is first in his own cause seemeth just ; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him .
and all the city was gathered together at the door .
who , when they came to caesarea , and delivered the epistle to the governor , presented paul also before him .
but simon ' s wife ' s mother lay sick of a fever , and anon they tell him of her .
on the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him , and returned to the castle :
and he came and took her by the hand , and lifted her up ; and immediately the fever left her , and she ministered unto them .
i will hear thee , said he , when thine accusers are also come . and he commanded him to be kept in herod ' s judgment hall .
then the soldiers , as it was commanded them , took paul , and brought him by night to antipatris .
and when it was told me how that the jews laid wait for the man , i sent straightway to thee , and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him . farewell .
a man that hath friends must shew himself friendly : and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother .
whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing , and obtaineth favour of the lord .
the poor useth intreaties ; but the rich answereth roughly .
a man ' s belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth ; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled .
death and life are in the power of the tongue : and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof .
and forthwith , when they were come out of the synagogue , they entered into the house of simon and andrew , with james and john .
and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments .
thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain : for the lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain .
and alammelech , and amad , and misheal ; and reacheth to carmel westward , and to shihor - libnath ;
and their border was helkath , and hali , and beten , and achshaph ,
and the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of asher according to their families .
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of issachar according to their families , the cities and their villages .
and the coast reacheth to tabor , and shahazimah , and beth - shemesh ; and the outgoings of their border were at jordan : sixteen cities with their villages .
and remeth , and en - gannim , and en - haddah , and beth - pazzez ;
and hapharaim , and shion , and anaharath ,
and the fourth lot came out to issachar , for the children of issachar according to their families .
and their border was toward jezreel , and chesulloth , and shunem ,
blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven , whose sin is covered .
blessed is the man unto whom the lord imputeth not iniquity , and in whose spirit there is no guile .
and the border compasseth it on the north side to hannathon : and the outgoings thereof are in the valley of jiphthah - el :
and from thence passeth on along on the east to gittah - hepher , to ittah - kazin , and goeth out to remmon - methoar to neah ;
this is the inheritance of the children of zebulun according to their families , these cities with their villages .
and kattath , and nahallal , and shimron , and idalah , and bethlehem : twelve cities with their villages .
and the third lot came up for the children of zebulun according to their families : and the border of their inheritance was unto sarid :
and turned from sarid eastward toward the sunrising unto the border of chisloth - tabor , and then goeth out to daberath , and goeth up to japhia ,
and their border went up toward the sea , and maralah , and reached to dabbasheth , and reached to the river that is before jokneam ;
go say to them , get you into your tents again .
but as for thee , stand thou here by me , and i will speak unto thee all the commandments , and the statutes , and the judgments , which thou shalt teach them , that they may do them in the land which i give them to possess it .
ye shall observe to do therefore as the lord your god hath commanded you : ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
ye shall walk in all the ways which the lord your god hath commanded you , that ye may live , and that it may be well with you , and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess .
and the lord heard the voice of your words , when ye spake unto me ; and the lord said unto me , i have heard the voice of the words of this people , which they have spoken unto thee : they have well said all that they have spoken .
for this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found : surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him .
go thou near , and hear all that the lord our god shall say : and speak thou unto us all that the lord our god shall speak unto thee ; and we will hear it , and do it .
for day and night thy hand was heavy upon me : my moisture is turned into the drought of summer . selah .
o that there were such an heart in them , that they would fear me , and keep all my commandments always , that it might be well with them , and with their children for ever !
when i kept silence , my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long .
and ye said , behold , the lord our god hath shewed us his glory and his greatness , and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire : we have seen this day that god doth talk with man , and he liveth .
and it came to pass , when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness , ( for the mountain did burn with fire , ) that ye came near unto me , even all the heads of your tribes , and your elders ;
be ye not as the horse , or as the mule , which have no understanding : whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle , lest they come near unto thee .
for who is there of all flesh , that hath heard the voice of the living god speaking out of the midst of the fire , as we have , and lived ?
i will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go : i will guide thee with mine eye .
now therefore why should we die ? for this great fire will consume us : if we hear the voice of the lord our god any more , then we shall die .
thou art my hiding place ; thou shalt preserve me from trouble ; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance . selah .
and ere the lamp of god went out in the temple of the lord , where the ark of god was , and samuel was laid down to sleep ;
neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour ' s wife , neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour ' s house , his field , or his manservant , or his maidservant , his ox , or his ass , or any thing that is thy neighbour ' s .
these words the lord spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire , of the cloud , and of the thick darkness , with a great voice : and he added no more . and he wrote them in two tables of stone , and delivered them unto me .
and he ran unto eli , and said , here am i ; for thou calledst me . and he said , i called not ; lie down again . and he went and lay down .
that the lord called samuel : and he answered , here am i .
neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour .
and the child samuel ministered unto the lord before eli . and the word of the lord was precious in those days ; there was no open vision .
neither shalt thou steal .
neither shalt thou commit adultery .
thou shalt not kill .
honour thy father and thy mother , as the lord thy god hath commanded thee ; that thy days may be prolonged , and that it may go well with thee , in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee .
and remember that thou wast a servant in the land of egypt , and that the lord thy god brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm : therefore the lord thy god commanded thee to keep the sabbath day .
six days thou shalt labour , and do all thy work :
keep the sabbath day to sanctify it , as the lord thy god hath commanded thee .
and thou wentest to the king with ointment , and didst increase thy perfumes , and didst send thy messengers far off , and didst debase thyself even unto hell .
and when saul ' s son heard that abner was dead in hebron , his hands were feeble , and all the israelites were troubled .
the righteous perisheth , and no man layeth it to heart : and merciful men are taken away , none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come .
and saul ' s son had two men that were captains of bands : the name of the one was baanah , and the name of the other rechab , the sons of rimmon a beerothite , of the children of benjamin : ( for beeroth also was reckoned to benjamin :
against whom do ye sport yourselves ? against whom make ye a wide mouth , and draw out the tongue ? are ye not children of transgression , a seed of falsehood ,
and the beerothites fled to gittaim , and were sojourners there until this day . )
but draw near hither , ye sons of the sorceress , the seed of the adulterer and the whore .
among the smooth stones of the stream is thy portion ; they , they are thy lot : even to them hast thou poured a drink offering , thou hast offered a meat offering . should i receive comfort in these ?
enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree , slaying the children in the valleys under the clifts of the rocks ?
behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance : for thou hast discovered thyself to another than me , and art gone up ; thou hast enlarged thy bed , and made thee a covenant with them ; thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it .
upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed : even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice .
and it came to pass , that he tarried many days in joppa with one simon a tanner .
and he gave her his hand , and lifted her up , and when he had called the saints and widows , presented her alive .
and it was known throughout all joppa ; and many believed in the lord .
but peter put them all forth , and kneeled down , and prayed ; and turning him to the body said , tabitha , arise . and she opened her eyes : and when she saw peter , she sat up .
according to the word of the lord they gave him the city which he asked , even timnath - serah in mount ephraim : and he built the city , and dwelt therein .
then peter arose and went with them . when he was come , they brought him into the upper chamber : and all the widows stood by him weeping , and shewing the coats and garments which dorcas made , while she was with them .
and forasmuch as lydda was nigh to joppa , and the disciples had heard that peter was there , they sent unto him two men , desiring him that he would not delay to come to them .
and it came to pass in those days , that she was sick , and died : whom when they had washed , they laid her in an upper chamber .
now there was at joppa a certain disciple named tabitha , which by interpretation is called dorcas : this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did .
which when the brethren knew , they brought him down to caesarea , and sent him forth to tarsus .
then had the churches rest throughout all judaea and galilee and samaria , and were edified ; and walking in the fear of the lord , and in the comfort of the holy ghost , were multiplied .
and it came to pass , as peter passed throughout all quarters , he came down also to the saints which dwelt at lydda .
and ye shall compass the city , all ye men of war , and go round about the city once . thus shalt thou do six days .
and there he found a certain man named aeneas , which had kept his bed eight years , and was sick of the palsy .
and the lord said unto joshua , see , i have given into thine hand jericho , and the king thereof , and the mighty men of valour .
and peter said unto him , aeneas , jesus christ maketh thee whole : arise , and make thy bed . and he arose immediately .
now jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of israel : none went out , and none came in .
and shaalabbin , and ajalon , and jethlah ,
these are the commandments and the judgments , which the lord commanded by the hand of moses unto the children of israel in the plains of moab by jordan near jericho .
and they went up on the breadth of the earth , and compassed the camp of the saints about , and the beloved city : and fire came down from god out of heaven , and devoured them .
and elon , and thimnathah , and ekron ,
and they were married into the families of the sons of manasseh the son of joseph , and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father .
and eltekeh , and gibbethon , and baalath ,
and jehud , and bene - berak , and gath - rimmon ,
and me - jarkon , and rakkon , with the border before japho .
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of dan according to their families , these cities with their villages .
when they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance by their coasts , the children of israel gave an inheritance to joshua the son of nun among them :
and when saul was come to jerusalem , he assayed to join himself to the disciples : but they were all afraid of him , and believed not that he was a disciple .
and joshua the son of nun called the priests , and said unto them , take up the ark of the covenant , and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams ' horns before the ark of the lord .
and he said unto the people , pass on , and compass the city , and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the lord .
and he was with them coming in and going out at jerusalem .
and seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams ' horns : and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times , and the priests shall blow with the trumpets .
but barnabas took him , and brought him to the apostles , and declared unto them how he had seen the lord in the way , and that he had spoken to him , and how he had preached boldly at damascus in the name of jesus .
so these three men ceased to answer job , because he was righteous in his own eyes .
and he spake boldly in the name of the lord jesus , and disputed against the grecians : but they went about to slay him .
and the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of dan according to their families .
for mahlal , tirzah , and hoglah , and milcah , and noah , the daughters of zelophehad , were married unto their father ' s brothers ' sons :
and it came to pass , when joshua had spoken unto the people , that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams ' horns passed on before the lord , and blew with the trumpets : and the ark of the covenant of the lord followed them .
and the coast of their inheritance was zorah , and eshtaol , and ir - shemesh ,
even as the lord commanded moses , so did the daughters of zelophehad :
and the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets , and the rereward came after the ark , the priests going on , and blowing with the trumpets .
then was kindled the wrath of elihu the son of barachel the buzite , of the kindred of ram : against job was his wrath kindled , because he justified himself rather than god .
and straightway he preached christ in the synagogues , that he is the son of god .
also against his three friends was his wrath kindled , because they had found no answer , and yet had condemned job .
now elihu had waited till job had spoken , because they were elder than he .
when elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men , then his wrath was kindled .
and after that many days were fulfilled , the jews took counsel to kill him :
and elihu the son of barachel the buzite answered and said , i am young , and ye are very old ; wherefore i was afraid , and durst not shew you mine opinion .
but their laying await was known of saul . and they watched the gates day and night to kill him .
i said , days should speak , and multitude of years should teach wisdom .
but all that heard him were amazed , and said ; is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in jerusalem , and came hither for that intent , that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests ?
but there is a spirit in man : and the inspiration of the almighty giveth them understanding .
but saul increased the more in strength , and confounded the jews which dwelt at damascus , proving that this is very christ .
great men are not always wise : neither do the aged understand judgment .
and cast him into the bottomless pit , and shut him up , and set a seal upon him , that he should deceive the nations no more , till the thousand years should be fulfilled : and after that he must be loosed a little season .
and i saw an angel come down from heaven , having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand .
and then the coast turneth to ramah , and to the strong city tyre ; and the coast turneth to hosah ; and the outgoings thereof are at the sea from the coast to achzib :
and he laid hold on the dragon , that old serpent , which is the devil , and satan , and bound him a thousand years ,
and hebron , and rehob , and hammon , and kanah , even unto great zidon ;
and when the thousand years are expired , satan shall be loosed out of his prison ,
and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth , gog and magog , to gather them together to battle : the number of whom is as the sand of the sea .
but the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished . this is the first resurrection .
blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection : on such the second death hath no power , but they shall be priests of god and of christ , and shall reign with him a thousand years .
and their coast was from heleph , from allon to zaanannim , and adami , nekeb , and jabneel , unto lakum ; and the outgoings thereof were at jordan :
and then the coast turneth westward to aznoth - tabor , and goeth out from thence to hukkok , and reacheth to zebulun on the south side , and reacheth to asher on the west side , and to judah upon jordan toward the sunrising .
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of asher according to their families , these cities with their villages .
the sixth lot came out to the children of naphtali , even for the children of naphtali according to their families .
and kedesh , and edrei , and en - hazor ,
and iron , and migdal - el , horem , and beth - anath , and beth - shemesh ; nineteen cities with their villages .
and the fenced cities are ziddim , zer , and hammath , rakkath , and chinnereth ,
and adamah , and ramah , and hazor ,
and ananias went his way , and entered into the house ; and putting his hands on him said , brother saul , the lord , even jesus , that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest , hath sent me , that thou mightest receive thy sight , and be filled with the holy ghost .
for i will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name ' s sake .
but the lord said unto him , go thy way : for he is a chosen vessel unto me , to bear my name before the gentiles , and kings , and the children of israel :
and here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name .
ummah also , and aphek , and rehob : twenty and two cities with their villages .
and when he had received meat , he was strengthened . then was saul certain days with the disciples which were at damascus .
and immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales : and he received sight forthwith , and arose , and was baptized .
and david and all israel played before god with all their might , and with singing , and with harps , and with psalteries , and with timbrels , and with cymbals , and with trumpets .
and all the congregation said that they would do so : for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people .
so david gathered all israel together , from shihor of egypt even unto the entering of hamath , to bring the ark of god from kirjath - jearim .
and david went up , and all israel , to baalah , that is , to kirjath - jearim , which belonged to judah , to bring up thence the ark of god the lord , that dwelleth between the cherubims , whose name is called on it .
and they carried the ark of god in a new cart out of the house of abinadab : and uzza and ahio drave the cart .
and let us bring again the ark of our god to us : for we inquired not at it in the days of saul .
the lord reigneth , he is clothed with majesty ; the lord is clothed with strength , wherewith he hath girded himself : the world also is stablished , that it cannot be moved .
thy throne is established of old : thou art from everlasting .
the floods have lifted up , o lord , the floods have lifted up their voice ; the floods lift up their waves .
the lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters , yea , than the mighty waves of the sea .
thy testimonies are very sure : holiness becometh thine house , o lord , for ever .
happy is that people , that is in such a case : yea , happy is that people , whose god is the lord .
that our oxen may be strong to labour ; that there be no breaking in , nor going out ; that there be no complaining in our streets .
that our garners may be full , affording all manner of store : that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets :
that our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth ; that our daughters may be as corner stones , polished after the similitude of a palace :
ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke : among the tribes of israel have i made known that which shall surely be .
rid me , and deliver me from the hand of strange children , whose mouth speaketh vanity , and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood :
blow ye the cornet in gibeah , and the trumpet in ramah : cry aloud at beth - aven , after thee , o benjamin .
it is he that giveth salvation unto kings : who delivereth david his servant from the hurtful sword .
they have dealt treacherously against the lord : for they have begotten strange children : now shall a month devour them with their portions .
and the pride of israel doth testify to his face : therefore shall israel and ephraim fall in their iniquity ; judah also shall fall with them .
they shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the lord ; but they shall not find him ; he hath withdrawn himself from them .
i know ephraim , and israel is not hid from me : for now , o ephraim , thou committest whoredom , and israel is defiled .
they will not frame their doings to turn unto their god : for the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them , and they have not known the lord .
hear ye this , o priests ; and hearken , ye house of israel ; and give ye ear , o house of the king ; for judgment is toward you , because ye have been a snare on mizpah , and a net spread upon tabor .
and the revolters are profound to make slaughter , though i have been a rebuker of them all .
and they came thither into the midst of the house , as though they would have fetched wheat ; and they smote him under the fifth rib : and rechab and baanah his brother escaped .
for when they came into the house , he lay on his bed in his bedchamber , and they smote him , and slew him , and beheaded him , and took his head , and gat them away through the plain all night .
and the sons of rimmon the beerothite , rechab and baanah , went , and came about the heat of the day to the house of ish - bosheth , who lay on a bed at noon .
and they brought the head of ish - bosheth unto david to hebron , and said to the king , behold the head of ish - bosheth the son of saul thine enemy , which sought thy life ; and the lord hath avenged my lord the king this day of saul , and of his seed .
and david answered rechab and baanah his brother , the sons of rimmon the beerothite , and said unto them , as the lord liveth , who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity ,
thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers : for i have spoken it , saith the lord god .
moreover the word of the lord came unto me , saying ,
son of man , take up a lamentation upon the king of tyrus , and say unto him , thus saith the lord god ; thou sealest up the sum , full of wisdom , and perfect in beauty .
and thou shalt speak unto him , saying , thus saith the lord , hast thou killed , and also taken possession ? and thou shalt speak unto him , saying , thus saith the lord , in the place where dogs licked the blood of naboth shall dogs lick thy blood , even thine .
and it came to pass , when jezebel heard that naboth was stoned , and was dead , that jezebel said to ahab , arise , take possession of the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite , which he refused to give thee for money : for naboth is not alive , but dead .
and it came to pass , when ahab heard that naboth was dead , that ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite , to take possession of it .
and the word of the lord came to elijah the tishbite , saying ,
arise , go down to meet ahab king of israel , which is in samaria : behold , he is in the vineyard of naboth , whither he is gone down to possess it .
and the men of his city , even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city , did as jezebel had sent unto them , and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them .
they proclaimed a fast , and set naboth on high among the people .
then they sent to jezebel , saying , naboth is stoned , and is dead .
for , lo , thine enemies , o lord , for , lo , thine enemies shall perish ; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered .
and set two men , sons of belial , before him , to bear witness against him , saying , thou didst blaspheme god and the king . and then carry him out , and stone him , that he may die .
though the lord be high , yet hath he respect unto the lowly : but the proud he knoweth afar off .
though i walk in the midst of trouble , thou wilt revive me : thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies , and thy right hand shall save me .
all the kings of the earth shall praise thee , o lord , when they hear the words of thy mouth .
yea , they shall sing in the ways of the lord : for great is the glory of the lord .
and the word of the lord came to elijah the tishbite , saying ,
seest thou how ahab humbleth himself before me ? because he humbleth himself before me , i will not bring the evil in his days : but in his son ' s days will i bring the evil upon his house .
and he did very abominably in following idols , according to all things as did the amorites , whom the lord cast out before the children of israel .
the lord will perfect that which concerneth me : thy mercy , o lord , endureth for ever : forsake not the works of thine own hands .
and it came to pass , when ahab heard those words , that he rent his clothes , and put sackcloth upon his flesh , and fasted , and lay in sackcloth , and went softly .
him that dieth of ahab in the city the dogs shall eat ; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat .
but there was none like unto ahab , which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the lord , whom jezebel his wife stirred up .
and will make thine house like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat , and like the house of baasha the son of ahijah , for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger , and made israel to sin .
and of jezebel also spake the lord , saying , the dogs shall eat jezebel by the wall of jezreel .
and ahab said to elijah , hast thou found me , o mine enemy ? and he answered , i have found thee : because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the lord .
behold , i will bring evil upon thee , and will take away thy posterity , and will cut off from ahab him that pisseth against the wall , and him that is shut up and left in israel ,
but every man in his own order : christ the firstfruits ; afterward they that are christ ' s at his coming .
i will praise thee with my whole heart : before the gods will i sing praise unto thee .
then cometh the end , when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to god , even the father ; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power .
and the lord said , because the cry of sodom and gomorrah is great , and because their sin is very grievous ;
for since by man came death , by man came also the resurrection of the dead .
in the day when i cried thou answeredst me , and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul .
for as in adam all die , even so in christ shall all be made alive .
and abraham drew near , and said , wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked ?
but now is christ risen from the dead , and become the firstfruits of them that slept .
peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city : wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein ?
i will go down now , and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it , which is come unto me ; and if not , i will know .
and the men turned their faces from thence , and went toward sodom : but abraham stood yet before the lord .
and the lord said , shall i hide from abraham that thing which i do ;
and the men rose up from thence , and looked toward sodom : and abraham went with them to bring them on the way .
then sarah denied , saying , i laughed not ; for she was afraid . and he said , nay ; but thou didst laugh .
else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead , if the dead rise not at all ? why are they then baptized for the dead ?
is any thing too hard for the lord ? at the time appointed i will return unto thee , according to the time of life , and sarah shall have a son .
and when all things shall be subdued unto him , then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him , that god may be all in all .
the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death .
for i know him , that he will command his children and his household after him , and they shall keep the way of the lord , to do justice and judgment ; that the lord may bring upon abraham that which he hath spoken of him .
seeing that abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation , and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him ?
but by the grace of god i am what i am : and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain ; but i laboured more abundantly than they all : yet not i , but the grace of god which was with me .
therefore whether it were i or they , so we preach , and so ye believed .
now if christ be preached that he rose from the dead , how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead ?
and he said unto him , oh let not the lord be angry , and i will speak : peradventure there shall thirty be found there . and he said , i will not do it , if i find thirty there .
but if there be no resurrection of the dead , then is christ not risen :
and he said , behold now , i have taken upon me to speak unto the lord : peradventure there shall be twenty found there . and he said , i will not destroy it for twenty ' s sake .
and he said , oh let not the lord be angry , and i will speak yet but this once : peradventure ten shall be found there . and he said , i will not destroy it for ten ' s sake .
and the lord went his way , as soon as he had left communing with abraham : and abraham returned unto his place .
if in this life only we have hope in christ , we are of all men most miserable .
and the lord said , if i find in sodom fifty righteous within the city , then i will spare all the place for their sakes .
then they also which are fallen asleep in christ are perished .
that be far from thee to do after this manner , to slay the righteous with the wicked : and that the righteous should be as the wicked , that be far from thee : shall not the judge of all the earth do right ?
peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous : wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five ? and he said , if i find there forty and five , i will not destroy it .
and abraham answered and said , behold now , i have taken upon me to speak unto the lord , which am but dust and ashes :
yea , and we are found false witnesses of god ; because we have testified of god that he raised up christ : whom he raised not up , if so be that the dead rise not .
and if christ be not risen , then is our preaching vain , and your faith is also vain .
and he spake unto him yet again , and said , peradventure there shall be forty found there . and he said , i will not do it for forty ' s sake .
and if christ be not raised , your faith is vain ; ye are yet in your sins .
for if the dead rise not , then is not christ raised :
ye shall not afflict any widow , or fatherless child .
if thou afflict them in any wise , and they cry at all unto me , i will surely hear their cry ;
and my wrath shall wax hot , and i will kill you with the sword ; and your wives shall be widows , and your children fatherless .
if thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee , thou shalt not be to him as an usurer , neither shalt thou lay upon him usury .
if thou at all take thy neighbour ' s raiment to pledge , thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down :
for that is his covering only , it is his raiment for his skin : wherein shall he sleep ? and it shall come to pass , when he crieth unto me , that i will hear ; for i am gracious .
thou shalt not revile the gods , nor curse the ruler of thy people .
thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits , and of thy liquors : the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me .
i am clean without transgression , i am innocent ; neither is there iniquity in me .
the spirit of god hath made me , and the breath of the almighty hath given me life .
my words shall be of the uprightness of my heart : and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly .
behold , now i have opened my mouth , my tongue hath spoken in my mouth .
wherefore , job , i pray thee , hear my speeches , and hearken to all my words .
surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing , and i have heard the voice of thy words , saying ,
behold , my terror shall not make thee afraid , neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee .
thou shalt neither vex a stranger , nor oppress him : for ye were strangers in the land of egypt .
behold , i am according to thy wish in god ' s stead : i also am formed out of the clay .
he that sacrificeth unto any god , save unto the lord only , he shall be utterly destroyed .
if thou canst answer me , set thy words in order before me , stand up .
if it be torn in pieces , then let him bring it for witness , and he shall not make good that which was torn .
now abraham and sarah were old and well stricken in age ; and it ceased to be with sarah after the manner of women .
and if a man borrow ought of his neighbour , and it be hurt , or die , the owner thereof being not with it , he shall surely make it good .
and he said , i will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life ; and , lo , sarah thy wife shall have a son . and sarah heard it in the tent door , which was behind him .
then shall an oath of the lord be between them both , that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour ' s goods ; and the owner of it shall accept thereof , and he shall not make it good .
and the lord said unto abraham , wherefore did sarah laugh , saying , shall i of a surety bear a child , which am old ?
and if it be stolen from him , he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof .
therefore sarah laughed within herself , saying , after i am waxed old shall i have pleasure , my lord being old also ?
if her father utterly refuse to give her unto him , he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins .
thou shalt not suffer a witch to live .
but if the owner thereof be with it , he shall not make it good : if it be an hired thing , it came for his hire .
and if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed , and lie with her , he shall surely endow her to be his wife .
whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death .
if a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass , or an ox , or a sheep , or any beast , to keep ; and it die , or be hurt , or driven away , no man seeing it :
and his father in law , the damsel ' s father , retained him ; and he abode with him three days : so they did eat and drink , and lodged there .
and his concubine played the whore against him , and went away from him unto her father ' s house to bethlehemjudah , and was there four whole months .
and it came to pass in those days , when there was no king in israel , that there was a certain levite sojourning on the side of mount ephraim , who took to him a concubine out of bethlehemjudah .
and he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart : and the damsel ' s father said , comfort thine heart , i pray thee . and they tarried until afternoon , and they did eat both of them .
and when the man rose up to depart , his father in law urged him : therefore he lodged there again .
and they sat down , and did eat and drink both of them together : for the damsel ' s father had said unto the man , be content , i pray thee , and tarry all night , and let thine heart be merry .
and it came to pass on the fourth day , when they arose early in the morning , that he rose up to depart : and the damsel ' s father said unto his son in law , comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread , and afterward go your way .
and ye shall be holy men unto me : neither shall ye eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field ; ye shall cast it to the dogs .
likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen , and with thy sheep : seven days it shall be with his dam ; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me .
ye therefore , beloved , seeing ye know these things before , beware lest ye also , being led away with the error of the wicked , fall from your own stedfastness .
then came peter to him , and said , lord , how oft shall my brother sin against me , and i forgive him ? till seven times ?
but grow in grace , and in the knowledge of our lord and saviour jesus christ . to him be glory both now and for ever . amen .
jesus saith unto him , i say not unto thee , until seven times : but , until seventy times seven .
therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king , which would take account of his servants .
and when he had begun to reckon , one was brought unto him , which owed him ten thousand talents .
nevertheless we , according to his promise , look for new heavens and a new earth , wherein dwelleth righteousness .
wherefore , beloved , seeing that ye look for such things , be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace , without spot , and blameless .
and account that the longsuffering of our lord is salvation ; even as our beloved brother paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you ;
as also in all his epistles , speaking in them of these things ; in which are some things hard to be understood , which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest , as they do also the other scriptures , unto their own destruction .
for where two or three are gathered together in my name , there am i in the midst of them .
and moses said unto the judges of israel , slay ye every one his men that were joined unto baal - peor .
and , behold , one of the children of israel came and brought unto his brethren a midianitish woman in the sight of moses , and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of israel , who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
and israel joined himself unto baal - peor : and the anger of the lord was kindled against israel .
and the lord said unto moses , take all the heads of the people , and hang them up before the lord against the sun , that the fierce anger of the lord may be turned away from israel .
and israel abode in shittim , and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of moab .
and they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods : and the people did eat , and bowed down to their gods .
but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night ; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise , and the elements shall melt with fervent heat , the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up .
and his fellowservant fell down at his feet , and besought him , saying , have patience with me , and i will pay thee all .
looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of god , wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved , and the elements shall melt with fervent heat ?
and shalt say unto them , thus saith the lord of hosts ; even so will i break this people and this city , as one breaketh a potter ' s vessel , that cannot be made whole again : and they shall bury them in tophet , till there be no place to bury .
seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved , what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness ,
then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee ,
and the houses of jerusalem , and the houses of the kings of judah , shall be defiled as the place of tophet , because of all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven , and have poured out drink offerings unto other gods .
the servant therefore fell down , and worshipped him , saying , lord , have patience with me , and i will pay thee all .
thus will i do unto this place , saith the lord , and to the inhabitants thereof , and even make this city as tophet :
but forasmuch as he had not to pay , his lord commanded him to be sold , and his wife , and children , and all that he had , and payment to be made .
thus saith the lord of hosts , the god of israel ; behold , i will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that i have pronounced against it , because they have hardened their necks , that they might not hear my words .
but the same servant went out , and found one of his fellowservants , which owed him an hundred pence : and he laid hands on him , and took him by the throat , saying , pay me that thou owest .
then came jeremiah from tophet , whither the lord had sent him to prophesy ; and he stood in the court of the lord ' s house ; and said to all the people ,
then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion , and loosed him , and forgave him the debt .
how think ye ? if a man have an hundred sheep , and one of them be gone astray , doth he not leave the ninety and nine , and goeth into the mountains , and seeketh that which is gone astray ?
and if so be that he find it , verily i say unto you , he rejoiceth more of that sheep , than of the ninety and nine which went not astray .
for the son of man is come to save that which was lost .
and he went after the man of israel into the tent , and thrust both of them through , the man of israel , and the woman through her belly . so the plague was stayed from the children of israel .
and when phinehas , the son of eleazar , the son of aaron the priest , saw it , he rose up from among the congregation , and took a javelin in his hand ;
and those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand .
again i say unto you , that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask , it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven .
verily i say unto you , whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven : and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven .
and if he shall neglect to hear them , tell it unto the church : but if he neglect to hear the church , let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican .
but if he will not hear thee , then take with thee one or two more , that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established .
moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee , go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone : if he shall hear thee , thou hast gained thy brother .
even so it is not the will of your father which is in heaven , that one of these little ones should perish .
vow , and pay unto the lord your god : let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared .
surely the wrath of man shall praise thee : the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain .
he shall cut off the spirit of princes : he is terrible to the kings of the earth .
the wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor : let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined .
why standest thou afar off , o lord ? why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble ?
and he would not : but went and cast him into prison , till he should pay the debt .
so when his fellowservants saw what was done , they were very sorry , and came and told unto their lord all that was done .
so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you , if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses .
then his lord , after that he had called him , said unto him , o thou wicked servant , i forgave thee all that debt , because thou desiredst me :
shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant , even as i had pity on thee ?
the first man is of the earth , earthy : the second man is the lord from heaven .
as is the earthy , such are they also that are earthy : and as is the heavenly , such are they also that are heavenly .
and as we have borne the image of the earthy , we shall also bear the image of the heavenly .
there are also celestial bodies , and bodies terrestrial : but the glory of the celestial is one , and the glory of the terrestrial is another .
and when it was day , certain of the jews banded together , and bound themselves under a curse , saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed paul .
and they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy .
so also is the resurrection of the dead . it is sown in corruption ; it is raised in incorruption :
and when there arose a great dissension , the chief captain , fearing lest paul should have been pulled in pieces of them , commanded the soldiers to go down , and to take him by force from among them , and to bring him into the castle .
there is one glory of the sun , and another glory of the moon , and another glory of the stars : for one star differeth from another star in glory .
and the night following the lord stood by him , and said , be of good cheer , paul : for as thou hast testified of me in jerusalem , so must thou bear witness also at rome .
it is sown a natural body ; it is raised a spiritual body . there is a natural body , and there is a spiritual body .
it is sown in dishonour ; it is raised in glory : it is sown in weakness ; it is raised in power :
howbeit that was not first which is spiritual , but that which is natural ; and afterward that which is spiritual .
and so it is written , the first man adam was made a living soul ; the last adam was made a quickening spirit .
so he took him , and brought him to the chief captain , and said , paul the prisoner called me unto him , and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee , who hath something to say unto thee .
then the chief captain took him by the hand , and went with him aside privately , and asked him , what is that thou hast to tell me ?
and when paul ' s sister ' s son heard of their lying in wait , he went and entered into the castle , and told paul .
then paul called one of the centurions unto him , and said , bring this young man unto the chief captain : for he hath a certain thing to tell him .
and they came to the chief priests and elders , and said , we have bound ourselves under a great curse , that we will eat nothing until we have slain paul .
now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow , as though ye would inquire something more perfectly concerning him : and we , or ever he come near , are ready to kill him .
but god giveth it a body as it hath pleased him , and to every seed his own body .
all flesh is not the same flesh : but there is one kind of flesh of men , another flesh of beasts , another of fishes , and another of birds .
he lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den : he lieth in wait to catch the poor : he doth catch the poor , when he draweth him into his net .
thou fool , that which thou sowest is not quickened , except it die :
he sitteth in the lurking places of the villages : in the secret places doth he murder the innocent : his eyes are privily set against the poor .
and that which thou sowest , thou sowest not that body that shall be , but bare grain , it may chance of wheat , or of some other grain :
his mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud : under his tongue is mischief and vanity .
he hath said in his heart , i shall not be moved : for i shall never be in adversity .
his ways are always grievous ; thy judgments are far above out of his sight : as for all his enemies , he puffeth at them .
the wicked , through the pride of his countenance , will not seek after god : god is not in all his thoughts .
for the wicked boasteth of his heart ' s desire , and blesseth the covetous , whom the lord abhorreth .
i protest by your rejoicing which i have in christ jesus our lord , i die daily .
and why stand we in jeopardy every hour ?
but some man will say , how are the dead raised up ? and with what body do they come ?
awake to righteousness , and sin not ; for some have not the knowledge of god : i speak this to your shame .
be not deceived : evil communications corrupt good manners .
if after the manner of men i have fought with beasts at ephesus , what advantageth it me , if the dead rise not ? let us eat and drink ; for to morrow we die .
my people hath been lost sheep : their shepherds have caused them to go astray , they have turned them away on the mountains : they have gone from mountain to hill , they have forgotten their restingplace .
all that found them have devoured them : and their adversaries said , we offend not , because they have sinned against the lord , the habitation of justice , even the lord , the hope of their fathers .
in those days , and in that time , saith the lord , the children of israel shall come , they and the children of judah together , going and weeping : they shall go , and seek the lord their god .
they shall ask the way to zion with their faces thitherward , saying , come , and let us join ourselves to the lord in a perpetual covenant that shall not be forgotten .
declare ye among the nations , and publish , and set up a standard ; publish , and conceal not : say , babylon is taken , bel is confounded , merodach is broken in pieces ; her idols are confounded , her images are broken in pieces .
for out of the north there cometh up a nation against her , which shall make her land desolate , and none shall dwell therein : they shall remove , they shall depart , both man and beast .
the word that the lord spake against babylon and against the land of the chaldeans by jeremiah the prophet .
and they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue , that it may be above the curious girdle of the ephod , and that the breastplate be not loosed from the ephod .
and aaron shall bear the names of the children of israel in the breastplate of judgment upon his heart , when he goeth in unto the holy place , for a memorial before the lord continually .
remove out of the midst of babylon , and go forth out of the land of the chaldeans , and be as the he goats before the flocks .
for , lo , i will raise and cause to come up against babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country : and they shall set themselves in array against her ; from thence she shall be taken : their arrows shall be as of a mighty expert man ; none shall return in vain .
and the stones shall be with the names of the children of israel , twelve , according to their names , like the engravings of a signet ; every one with his name shall they be according to the twelve tribes .
and the fourth row a beryl , and an onyx , and a jasper : they shall be set in gold in their inclosings .
and thou shalt make upon the breastplate two rings of gold , and shalt put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate .
and thou shalt make upon the breastplate chains at the ends of wreathen work of pure gold .
and the other two ends of the two wreathen chains thou shalt fasten in the two ouches , and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod before it .
and thou shalt put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings which are on the ends of the breastplate .
and two other rings of gold thou shalt make , and shalt put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath , toward the forepart thereof , over against the other coupling thereof , above the curious girdle of the ephod .
and thou shalt make two rings of gold , and thou shalt put them upon the two ends of the breastplate in the border thereof , which is in the side of the ephod inward .
and the third row a ligure , an agate , and an amethyst .
and thou shalt set in it settings of stones , even four rows of stones : the first row shall be a sardius , a topaz , and a carbuncle : this shall be the first row .
and the second row shall be an emerald , a sapphire , and a diamond .
but thanks be to god , which giveth us the victory through our lord jesus christ .
and thou shalt put the two stones upon the shoulders of the ephod for stones of memorial unto the children of israel : and aaron shall bear their names before the lord upon his two shoulders for a memorial .
the sting of death is sin ; and the strength of sin is the law .
with the work of an engraver in stone , like the engravings of a signet , shalt thou engrave the two stones with the names of the children of israel : thou shalt make them to be set in ouches of gold .
o death , where is thy sting ? o grave , where is thy victory ?
six of their names on one stone , and the other six names of the rest on the other stone , according to their birth .
so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption , and this mortal shall have put on immortality , then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written , death is swallowed up in victory .
for this corruptible must put on incorruption , and this mortal must put on immortality .
foursquare it shall be being doubled ; a span shall be the length thereof , and a span shall be the breadth thereof .
in a moment , in the twinkling of an eye , at the last trump : for the trumpet shall sound , and the dead shall be raised incorruptible , and we shall be changed .
and thou shalt make the breastplate of judgment with cunning work ; after the work of the ephod thou shalt make it ; of gold , of blue , and of purple , and of scarlet , and of fine twined linen , shalt thou make it .
behold , i shew you a mystery ; we shall not all sleep , but we shall all be changed ,
and two chains of pure gold at the ends ; of wreathen work shalt thou make them , and fasten the wreathen chains to the ouches .
now this i say , brethren , that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god ; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption .
and thou shalt make ouches of gold ;
and he called his name noah , saying , this same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands , because of the ground which the lord hath cursed .
and lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years , and begat a son :
and all the days of methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years : and he died .
and methuselah lived after he begat lamech seven hundred eighty and two years , and begat sons and daughters :
and methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years , and begat lamech :
and enoch walked with god : and he was not ; for god took him .
and all the days of enoch were three hundred sixty and five years :
and enoch walked with god after he begat methuselah three hundred years , and begat sons and daughters :
and enoch lived sixty and five years , and begat methuselah :
and all the days of jared were nine hundred sixty and two years : and he died .
but the thing displeased samuel , when they said , give us a king to judge us . and samuel prayed unto the lord .
and said unto him , behold , thou art old , and thy sons walk not in thy ways : now make us a king to judge us like all the nations .
according to all the works which they have done since the day that i brought them up out of egypt even unto this day , wherewith they have forsaken me , and served other gods , so do they also unto thee .
and the lord said unto samuel , hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee : for they have not rejected thee , but they have rejected me , that i should not reign over them .
now the name of his firstborn was joel ; and the name of his second , abiah : they were judges in beer - sheba .
and all the days of mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years : and he died .
and it came to pass , when samuel was old , that he made his sons judges over israel .
and mahalaleel lived after he begat jared eight hundred and thirty years , and begat sons and daughters :
then all the elders of israel gathered themselves together , and came to samuel unto ramah ,
and his sons walked not in his ways , but turned aside after lucre , and took bribes , and perverted judgment .
and jared lived an hundred sixty and two years , and he begat enoch :
and cainan lived after he begat mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years , and begat sons and daughters :
and cainan lived seventy years , and begat mahalaleel :
and mahalaleel lived sixty and five years , and begat jared :
and all the days of cainan were nine hundred and ten years : and he died .
now therefore hearken unto their voice : howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them , and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them .
and all the days of enos were nine hundred and five years : and he died .
and enos lived after he begat cainan eight hundred and fifteen years , and begat sons and daughters :
and the sons of cush ; seba , and havilah , and sabta , and raamah , and sabtecha . and the sons of raamah ; sheba , and dedan .
noah , shem , ham , and japheth .
adam , sheth , enosh ,
kenan , mahalaleel , jered ,
and the sons of javan ; elishah , and tarshish , kittim , and dodanim .
the sons of ham ; cush , and mizraim , put , and canaan .
the sons of japheth ; gomer , and magog , and madai , and javan , and tubal , and meshech , and tiras .
and the sons of gomer ; ashchenaz , and riphath , and togarmah .
for they shall soon be cut down like the grass , and wither as the green herb .
trust in the lord , and do good ; so shalt thou dwell in the land , and verily thou shalt be fed .
delight thyself also in the lord ; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart .
commit thy way unto the lord ; trust also in him ; and he shall bring it to pass .
fret not thyself because of evildoers , neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity .
and all the days of lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years : and he died .
and lamech lived after he begat noah five hundred ninety and five years , and begat sons and daughters :
and noah was five hundred years old : and noah begat shem , ham , and japheth .
and he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light , and thy judgment as the noonday .
rest in the lord , and wait patiently for him : fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way , because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass .
cease from anger , and forsake wrath : fret not thyself in any wise to do evil .
for evildoers shall be cut off : but those that wait upon the lord , they shall inherit the earth .
then the high priest and the chief of the jews informed him against paul , and besought him ,
now when festus was come into the province , after three days he ascended from caesarea to jerusalem .
and desired favour against him , that he would send for him to jerusalem , laying wait in the way to kill him .
but festus answered , that paul should be kept at caesarea , and that he himself would depart shortly thither .
let them therefore , said he , which among you are able , go down with me , and accuse this man , if there be any wickedness in him .
and when he had tarried among them more than ten days , he went down unto caesarea ; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded paul to be brought .
and when he was come , the jews which came down from jerusalem stood round about , and laid many and grievous complaints against paul , which they could not prove .
while he answered for himself , neither against the law of the jews , neither against the temple , nor yet against caesar , have i offended any thing at all .
but festus , willing to do the jews a pleasure , answered paul , and said , wilt thou go up to jerusalem , and there be judged of these things before me ?
through god we shall do valiantly : for he it is that shall tread down our enemies .
give us help from trouble : for vain is the help of man .
wilt not thou , o god , which hadst cast us off ? and thou , o god , which didst not go out with our armies ?
wait on the lord : be of good courage , and he shall strengthen thine heart : wait , i say , on the lord .
deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies : for false witnesses are risen up against me , and such as breathe out cruelty .
i had fainted , unless i had believed to see the goodness of the lord in the land of the living .
teach me thy way , o lord , and lead me in a plain path , because of mine enemies .
the woman then left her waterpot , and went her way into the city , and saith to the men ,
and upon this came his disciples , and marvelled that he talked with the woman : yet no man said , what seekest thou ? or , why talkest thou with her ?
jesus saith unto her , i that speak unto thee am he .
the woman saith unto him , i know that messias cometh , which is called christ : when he is come , he will tell us all things .
god is a spirit : and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth .
and i will come down and talk with thee there : and i will take of the spirit which is upon thee , and will put it upon them ; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee , that thou bear it not thyself alone .
but the hour cometh , and now is , when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth : for the father seeketh such to worship him .
ye worship ye know not what : we know what we worship : for salvation is of the jews .
ye shall not eat one day , nor two days , nor five days , neither ten days , nor twenty days ;
jesus saith unto her , woman , believe me , the hour cometh , when ye shall neither in this mountain , nor yet at jerusalem , worship the father .
come , see a man , which told me all things that ever i did : is not this the christ ?
and the lord came down in a cloud , and spake unto him , and took of the spirit that was upon him , and gave it unto the seventy elders : and it came to pass , that , when the spirit rested upon them , they prophesied , and did not cease .
our fathers worshipped in this mountain ; and ye say , that in jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship .
and moses went out , and told the people the words of the lord , and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people , and set them round about the tabernacle .
and there ran a young man , and told moses , and said , eldad and medad do prophesy in the camp .
but there remained two of the men in the camp , the name of the one was eldad , and the name of the other medad : and the spirit rested upon them ; and they were of them that were written , but went not out unto the tabernacle : and they prophesied in the camp .
and moses said , the people , among whom i am , are six hundred thousand footmen ; and thou hast said , i will give them flesh , that they may eat a whole month .
but even a whole month , until it come out at your nostrils , and it be loathsome unto you : because that ye have despised the lord which is among you , and have wept before him , saying , why came we forth out of egypt ?
and the lord said unto moses , is the lord ' s hand waxed short ? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not .
shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them , to suffice them ? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them , to suffice them ?
the woman saith unto him , sir , give me this water , that i thirst not , neither come hither to draw .
but whosoever drinketh of the water that i shall give him shall never thirst ; but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life .
the woman answered and said , i have no husband . jesus said unto her , thou hast well said , i have no husband :
jesus saith unto her , go , call thy husband , and come hither .
the woman saith unto him , sir , thou hast nothing to draw with , and the well is deep : from whence then hast thou that living water ?
and he did evil in the sight of the lord , and walked in the way of jeroboam , and in his sin wherewith he made israel to sin .
jesus answered and said unto her , if thou knewest the gift of god , and who it is that saith to thee , give me to drink ; thou wouldest have asked of him , and he would have given thee living water .
jesus answered and said unto her , whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again :
art thou greater than our father jacob , which gave us the well , and drank thereof himself , and his children , and his cattle ?
the woman saith unto him , sir , i perceive that thou art a prophet .
for thou hast had five husbands ; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband : in that saidst thou truly .
and the lord said unto moses , gather unto me seventy men of the elders of israel , whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people , and officers over them ; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation , that they may stand there with thee .
and if thou deal thus with me , kill me , i pray thee , out of hand , if i have found favour in thy sight ; and let me not see my wretchedness .
i am not able to bear all this people alone , because it is too heavy for me .
whence should i have flesh to give unto all this people ? for they weep unto me , saying , give us flesh , that we may eat .
have i conceived all this people ? have i begotten them , that thou shouldest say unto me , carry them in thy bosom , as a nursing father beareth the sucking child , unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers ?
and moses said unto the lord , wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant ? and wherefore have i not found favour in thy sight , that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me ?
then moses heard the people weep throughout their families , every man in the door of his tent : and the anger of the lord was kindled greatly ; moses also was displeased .
so jesus came again into cana of galilee , where he made the water wine . and there was a certain nobleman , whose son was sick at capernaum .
then when he was come into galilee , the galilaeans received him , having seen all the things that he did at jerusalem at the feast : for they also went unto the feast .
for jesus himself testified , that a prophet hath no honour in his own country .
now after two days he departed thence , and went into galilee .
the nobleman saith unto him , sir , come down ere my child die .
then said jesus unto him , except ye see signs and wonders , ye will not believe .
when he heard that jesus was come out of judaea into galilee , he went unto him , and besought him that he would come down , and heal his son : for he was at the point of death .
surely i have behaved and quieted myself , as a child that is weaned of his mother : my soul is even as a weaned child .
lord , my heart is not haughty , nor mine eyes lofty : neither do i exercise myself in great matters , or in things too high for me .
and many more believed because of his own word ;
and said unto the woman , now we believe , not because of thy saying : for we have heard him ourselves , and know that this is indeed the christ , the saviour of the world .
let israel hope in the lord from henceforth and for ever .
so when the samaritans were come unto him , they besought him that he would tarry with them : and he abode there two days .
therefore said the disciples one to another , hath any man brought him ought to eat ?
but he said unto them , i have meat to eat that ye know not of .
say not ye , there are yet four months , and then cometh harvest ? behold , i say unto you , lift up your eyes , and look on the fields ; for they are white already to harvest .
and joshua the son of nun , the servant of moses , one of his young men , answered and said , my lord moses , forbid them .
jesus saith unto them , my meat is to do the will of him that sent me , and to finish his work .
and moses said unto him , enviest thou for my sake ? would god that all the lord ' s people were prophets , and that the lord would put his spirit upon them !
and herein is that saying true , one soweth , and another reapeth .
and he that reapeth receiveth wages , and gathereth fruit unto life eternal : that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together .
and many of the samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman , which testified , he told me all that ever i did .
i sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour : other men laboured , and ye are entered into their labours .
and moses gat him into the camp , he and the elders of israel .
and he called the name of that place kibroth - hattaavah : because there they buried the people that lusted .
and while the flesh was yet between their teeth , ere it was chewed , the wrath of the lord was kindled against the people , and the lord smote the people with a very great plague .
and the people stood up all that day , and all that night , and all the next day , and they gathered the quails : he that gathered least gathered ten homers : and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp .
then they went out of the city , and came unto him .
in the mean while his disciples prayed him , saying , master , eat .
and the people journeyed from kibroth - hattaavah unto hazeroth ; and abode at hazeroth .
and at what instant i shall speak concerning a nation , and concerning a kingdom , to build and to plant it ;
if that nation , against whom i have pronounced , turn from their evil , i will repent of the evil that i thought to do unto them .
then the word of the lord came to me , saying ,
and the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter : so he made it again another vessel , as seemed good to the potter to make it .
at what instant i shall speak concerning a nation , and concerning a kingdom , to pluck up , and to pull down , and to destroy it ;
and forty and one years reigned he in jerusalem . and his mother ' s name was maachah , the daughter of abishalom .
and asa did that which was right in the eyes of the lord , as did david his father .
the word which came to jeremiah from the lord , saying ,
arise , and go down to the potter ' s house , and there i will cause thee to hear my words .
then i went down to the potter ' s house , and , behold , he wrought a work on the wheels .
and they said , should he deal with our sister as with an harlot ?
and he did evil in the sight of the lord , and walked in the way of his father , and in his sin wherewith he made israel to sin .
and nadab the son of jeroboam began to reign over israel in the second year of asa king of judah , and reigned over israel two years .
and asa slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of david his father : and jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead .
the rest of all the acts of asa , and all his might , and all that he did , and the cities which he built , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah ? nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet .
and it came to pass , when he reigned , that he smote all the house of jeroboam ; he left not to jeroboam any that breathed , until he had destroyed him , according unto the saying of the lord , which he spake by his servant ahijah the shilonite :
even in the third year of asa king of judah did baasha slay him , and reigned in his stead .
and baasha the son of ahijah , of the house of issachar , conspired against him ; and baasha smote him at gibbethon , which belonged to the philistines ; for nadab and all israel laid siege to gibbethon .
and they slew hamor and shechem his son with the edge of the sword , and took dinah out of shechem ' s house , and went out .
and it came to pass on the third day , when they were sore , that two of the sons of jacob , simeon and levi , dinah ' s brethren , took each man his sword , and came upon the city boldly , and slew all the males .
and when he heard say of tirhakah king of ethiopia , behold , he is come out to fight against thee : he sent messengers again unto hezekiah , saying ,
and unto hamor and unto shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city ; and every male was circumcised , all that went out of the gate of his city .
shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs be ours ? only let us consent unto them , and they will dwell with us .
behold , i will send a blast upon him , and he shall hear a rumour , and shall return to his own land ; and i will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land .
and there was war between asa and baasha king of israel all their days .
only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us , to be one people , if every male among us be circumcised , as they are circumcised .
and isaiah said unto them , thus shall ye say to your master , thus saith the lord , be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard , with which the servants of the king of assyria have blasphemed me .
in the third year of asa king of judah began baasha the son of ahijah to reign over all israel in tirzah , twenty and four years .
these men are peaceable with us ; therefore let them dwell in the land , and trade therein ; for the land , behold , it is large enough for them ; let us take their daughters to us for wives , and let us give them our daughters .
so the servants of king hezekiah came to isaiah .
because of the sins of jeroboam which he sinned , and which he made israel sin , by his provocation wherewith he provoked the lord god of israel to anger .
and hamor and shechem his son came unto the gate of their city , and communed with the men of their city , saying ,
it may be the lord thy god will hear all the words of rab - shakeh , whom the king of assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living god ; and will reprove the words which the lord thy god hath heard : wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that are left .
now the rest of the acts of nadab , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel ?
and they said unto him , thus saith hezekiah , this day is a day of trouble , and of rebuke , and blasphemy : for the children are come to the birth , and there is not strength to bring forth .
and he sent eliakim , which was over the household , and shebna the scribe , and the elders of the priests , covered with sackcloth , to isaiah the prophet the son of amoz .
and it came to pass , when king hezekiah heard it , that he rent his clothes , and covered himself with sackcloth , and went into the house of the lord .
and all their wealth , and all their little ones , and their wives took they captive , and spoiled even all that was in the house .
the sons of jacob came upon the slain , and spoiled the city , because they had defiled their sister .
and also maachah his mother , even her he removed from being queen , because she had made an idol in a grove ; and asa destroyed her idol , and burnt it by the brook kidron .
and he took away the sodomites out of the land , and removed all the idols that his fathers had made .
and he brought in the things which his father had dedicated , and the things which himself had dedicated , into the house of the lord , silver , and gold , and vessels .
but the high places were not removed : nevertheless asa ' s heart was perfect with the lord all his days .
and baasha king of israel went up against judah , and built ramah , that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to asa king of judah .
there is a league between me and thee , and between my father and thy father : behold , i have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold ; come and break thy league with baasha king of israel , that he may depart from me .
and the sons of jacob answered shechem and hamor his father deceitfully , and said , because he had defiled dinah their sister :
ask me never so much dowry and gift , and i will give according as ye shall say unto me : but give me the damsel to wife .
but in this will we consent unto you : if ye will be as we be , that every male of you be circumcised ;
and they said unto them , we cannot do this thing , to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised ; for that were a reproach unto us :
so ben - hadad hearkened unto king asa , and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of israel , and smote ijon , and dan , and abel - beth - maachah , and all cinneroth , with all the land of naphtali .
and it came to pass , when baasha heard thereof , that he left off building of ramah , and dwelt in tirzah .
and shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren , let me find grace in your eyes , and what ye shall say unto me i will give .
then king asa made a proclamation throughout all judah ; none was exempted : and they took away the stones of ramah , and the timber thereof , wherewith baasha had builded ; and king asa built with them geba of benjamin , and mizpah .
and ye shall dwell with us : and the land shall be before you ; dwell and trade ye therein , and get you possessions therein .
but if ye will not hearken unto us , to be circumcised ; then will we take our daughter , and we will be gone .
then will we give our daughters unto you , and we will take your daughters to us , and we will dwell with you , and we will become one people .
and the young man deferred not to do the thing , because he had delight in jacob ' s daughter : and he was more honourable than all the house of his father .
and their words pleased hamor , and shechem hamor ' s son .
then the lord answered job out of the whirlwind , and said ,
who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge ?
gird up now thy loins like a man ; for i will demand of thee , and answer thou me .
or who shut up the sea with doors , when it brake forth , as if it had issued out of the womb ?
when i made the cloud the garment thereof , and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it ,
where wast thou when i laid the foundations of the earth ? declare , if thou hast understanding .
who hath laid the measures thereof , if thou knowest ? or who hath stretched the line upon it ?
whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened ? or who laid the corner stone thereof ;
when the morning stars sang together , and all the sons of god shouted for joy ?
and the angels which kept not their first estate , but left their own habitation , he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day .
and the lord shall smite egypt : he shall smite and heal it : and they shall return even to the lord , and he shall be intreated of them , and shall heal them .
the meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the lord ; the priests , the lord ' s ministers , mourn .
even as sodom and gomorrha , and the cities about them in like manner , giving themselves over to fornication , and going after strange flesh , are set forth for an example , suffering the vengeance of eternal fire .
and the lord shall be known to egypt , and the egyptians shall know the lord in that day , and shall do sacrifice and oblation ; yea , they shall vow a vow unto the lord , and perform it .
likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh , despise dominion , and speak evil of dignities .
and it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the lord of hosts in the land of egypt : for they shall cry unto the lord because of the oppressors , and he shall send them a saviour , and a great one , and he shall deliver them .
he hath laid my vine waste , and barked my fig tree : he hath made it clean bare , and cast it away ; the branches thereof are made white .
yet michael the archangel , when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of moses , durst not bring against him a railing accusation , but said , the lord rebuke thee .
lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth .
whom the lord of hosts shall bless , saying , blessed be egypt my people , and assyria the work of my hands , and israel mine inheritance .
in that day shall israel be the third with egypt and with assyria , even a blessing in the midst of the land :
in that day shall there be a highway out of egypt to assyria , and the assyrian shall come into egypt , and the egyptian into assyria , and the egyptians shall serve with the assyrians .
jude , the servant of jesus christ , and brother of james , to them that are sanctified by god the father , and preserved in jesus christ , and called :
mercy unto you , and peace , and love , be multiplied .
beloved , when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation , it was needful for me to write unto you , and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints .
for there are certain men crept in unawares , who were before of old ordained to this condemnation , ungodly men , turning the grace of our god into lasciviousness , and denying the only lord god , and our lord jesus christ .
i will therefore put you in remembrance , though ye once knew this , how that the lord , having saved the people out of the land of egypt , afterward destroyed them that believed not .
surely the princes of zoan are fools , the counsel of the wise counsellers of pharaoh is become brutish : how say ye unto pharaoh , i am the son of the wise , the son of ancient kings ?
and they shall be broken in the purposes thereof , all that make sluices and ponds for fish .
the princes of zoan are become fools , the princes of noph are deceived ; they have also seduced egypt , even they that are the stay of the tribes thereof .
where are they ? where are thy wise men ? and let them tell thee now , and let them know what the lord of hosts hath purposed upon egypt .
neither shall there be any work for egypt , which the head or tail , branch or rush , may do .
the lord hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof : and they have caused egypt to err in every work thereof , as a drunken man staggereth in his vomit .
and the land of judah shall be a terror unto egypt , every one that maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself , because of the counsel of the lord of hosts , which he hath determined against it .
in that day shall egypt be like unto women : and it shall be afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the lord of hosts , which he shaketh over it .
in that day shall five cities in the land of egypt speak the language of canaan , and swear to the lord of hosts ; one shall be called , the city of destruction .
hear this , ye old men , and give ear , all ye inhabitants of the land . hath this been in your days , or even in the days of your fathers ?
the word of the lord that came to joel the son of pethuel .
that which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten ; and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten ; and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller eaten .
tell ye your children of it , and let your children tell their children , and their children another generation .
for a nation is come up upon my land , strong , and without number , whose teeth are the teeth of a lion , and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion .
awake , ye drunkards , and weep ; and howl , all ye drinkers of wine , because of the new wine ; for it is cut off from your mouth .
after them repaired zadok the son of immer over against his house . after him repaired also shemaiah the son of shechaniah , the keeper of the east gate .
from above the horse gate repaired the priests , every one over against his house .
after them the tekoites repaired another piece , over against the great tower that lieth out , even unto the wall of ophel .
moreover the nethinims dwelt in ophel , unto the place over against the water gate toward the east , and the tower that lieth out .
so the father knew that it was at the same hour , in the which jesus said unto him , thy son liveth : and himself believed , and his whole house .
let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter : fear god , and keep his commandments : for this is the whole duty of man .
then inquired he of them the hour when he began to amend . and they said unto him , yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him .
for god shall bring every work into judgment , with every secret thing , whether it be good , or whether it be evil .
and as he was now going down , his servants met him , and told him , saying , thy son liveth .
the words of the wise are as goads , and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies , which are given from one shepherd .
jesus saith unto him , go thy way ; thy son liveth . and the man believed the word that jesus had spoken unto him , and he went his way .
and further , by these , my son , be admonished : of making many books there is no end ; and much study is a weariness of the flesh .
after him repaired meremoth the son of urijah the son of koz another piece , from the door of the house of eliashib even to the end of the house of eliashib .
after him baruch the son of zabbai earnestly repaired the other piece , from the turning of the wall unto the door of the house of eliashib the high priest .
the preacher sought to find out acceptable words : and that which was written was upright , even words of truth .
palal the son of uzai , over against the turning of the wall , and the tower which lieth out from the king ' s high house , that was by the court of the prison . after him pedaiah the son of parosh .
after him repaired binnui the son of henadad another piece , from the house of azariah unto the turning of the wall , even unto the corner .
after him repaired benjamin and hashub over against their house . after him repaired azariah the son of maaseiah the son of ananiah by his house .
and after him repaired the priests , the men of the plain .
how shall i give thee up , ephraim ? how shall i deliver thee , israel ? how shall i make thee as admah ? how shall i set thee as zeboim ? mine heart is turned within me , my repentings are kindled together .
i will not execute the fierceness of mine anger , i will not return to destroy ephraim : for i am god , and not man ; the holy one in the midst of thee : and i will not enter into the city .
i drew them with cords of a man , with bands of love : and i was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws , and i laid meat unto them .
he shall not return into the land of egypt , but the assyrian shall be his king , because they refused to return .
this is again the second miracle that jesus did , when he was come out of judaea into galilee .
and the sword shall abide on his cities , and shall consume his branches , and devour them , because of their own counsels .
and my people are bent to backsliding from me : though they called them to the most high , none at all would exalt him .
when israel was a child , then i loved him , and called my son out of egypt .
as they called them , so they went from them : they sacrificed unto baalim , and burned incense to graven images .
i taught ephraim also to go , taking them by their arms ; but they knew not that i healed them .
then the lord said unto moses , go in unto pharaoh , and tell him , thus saith the lord god of the hebrews , let my people go , that they may serve me .
for if thou refuse to let them go , and wilt hold them still ,
after him repaired hananiah the son of shelemiah , and hanun the sixth son of zalaph , another piece . after him repaired meshullam the son of berechiah over against his chamber .
and between the going up of the corner unto the sheep gate repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants .
after him repaired malchiah the goldsmith ' s son unto the place of the nethinims , and of the merchants , over against the gate miphkad , and to the going up of the corner .
and saul said unto his servants , provide me now a man that can play well , and bring him to me .
then answered one of the servants , and said , behold , i have seen a son of jesse the bethlehemite , that is cunning in playing , and a mighty valiant man , and a man of war , and prudent in matters , and a comely person , and the lord is with him .
wherefore saul sent messengers unto jesse , and said , send me david thy son , which is with the sheep .
then samuel took the horn of oil , and anointed him in the midst of his brethren : and the spirit of the lord came upon david from that day forward . so samuel rose up , and went to ramah .
but the spirit of the lord departed from saul , and an evil spirit from the lord troubled him .
and saul ' s servants said unto him , behold now , an evil spirit from god troubleth thee .
let our lord now command thy servants , which are before thee , to seek out a man , who is a cunning player on an harp : and it shall come to pass , when the evil spirit from god is upon thee , that he shall play with his hand , and thou shalt be well .
again , jesse made seven of his sons to pass before samuel . and samuel said unto jesse , the lord hath not chosen these .
and he sent , and brought him in . now he was ruddy , and withal of a beautiful countenance , and goodly to look to . and the lord said , arise , anoint him : for this is he .
and samuel said unto jesse , are here all thy children ? and he said , there remaineth yet the youngest , and , behold , he keepeth the sheep . and samuel said unto jesse , send and fetch him : for we will not sit down till he come hither .
and the lord said unto moses and unto aaron , take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace , and let moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of pharaoh .
and pharaoh sent , and , behold , there was not one of the cattle of the israelites dead . and the heart of pharaoh was hardened , and he did not let the people go .
and it shall become small dust in all the land of egypt , and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man , and upon beast , throughout all the land of egypt .
and the lord shall sever between the cattle of israel and the cattle of egypt : and there shall nothing die of all that is the children ' s of israel .
behold , the hand of the lord is upon thy cattle which is in the field , upon the horses , upon the asses , upon the camels , upon the oxen , and upon the sheep : there shall be a very grievous murrain .
and the lord did that thing on the morrow , and all the cattle of egypt died : but of the cattle of the children of israel died not one .
and the lord appointed a set time , saying , to morrow the lord shall do this thing in the land .
and next to him repaired ezer the son of jeshua , the ruler of mizpah , another piece over against the going up to the armoury at the turning of the wall .
after him repaired nehemiah the son of azbuk , the ruler of the half part of beth - zur , unto the place over against the sepulchres of david , and to the pool that was made , and unto the house of the mighty .
after him repaired their brethren , bavai the son of henadad , the ruler of the half part of keilah .
after him repaired the levites , rehum the son of bani . next unto him repaired hashabiah , the ruler of the half part of keilah , in his part .
and next unto him repaired shallum the son of halohesh , the ruler of the half part of jerusalem , he and his daughters .
malchijah the son of harim , and hashub the son of pahath - moab , repaired the other piece , and the tower of the furnaces .
but the dung gate repaired malchiah the son of rechab , the ruler of part of beth - haccerem ; he built it , and set up the doors thereof , the locks thereof , and the bars thereof .
the valley gate repaired hanun , and the inhabitants of zanoah ; they built it , and set up the doors thereof , the locks thereof , and the bars thereof , and a thousand cubits on the wall unto the dung gate .
and next unto them repaired jedaiah the son of harumaph , even over against his house . and next unto him repaired hattush the son of hashabniah .
and it came to pass , when the evil spirit from god was upon saul , that david took an harp , and played with his hand : so saul was refreshed , and was well , and the evil spirit departed from him .
and saul sent to jesse , saying , let david , i pray thee , stand before me ; for he hath found favour in my sight .
and david came to saul , and stood before him : and he loved him greatly ; and he became his armourbearer .
and jesse took an ass laden with bread , and a bottle of wine , and a kid , and sent them by david his son unto saul .
six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread : and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the lord thy god : thou shalt do no work therein .
and when this cometh to pass , ( lo , it will come , ) then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them .
and thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the lord thy god shall choose : and thou shalt turn in the morning , and go unto thy tents .
sing unto him , sing psalms unto him , talk ye of all his wondrous works .
seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee : begin to number the seven weeks from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle to the corn .
then on that day david delivered first this psalm to thank the lord into the hand of asaph and his brethren .
and there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy coast seven days ; neither shall there anything of the flesh , which thou sacrificedst the first day at even , remain all night until the morning .
give thanks unto the lord , call upon his name , make known his deeds among the people .
thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it ; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith , even the bread of affliction ; for thou camest forth out of the land of egypt in haste : that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of egypt all the days of thy life .
asaph the chief , and next to him zechariah , jeiel , and shemiramoth , and jehiel , and mattithiah , and eliab , and benaiah , and obed - edom : and jeiel with psalteries and with harps ; but asaph made a sound with cymbals ;
but at the place which the lord thy god shall choose to place his name in , there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even , at the going down of the sun , at the season that thou camest forth out of egypt .
and they come unto thee as the people cometh , and they sit before thee as my people , and they hear thy words , but they will not do them : for with their mouth they shew much love , but their heart goeth after their covetousness .
benaiah also and jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of god .
thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates , which the lord thy god giveth thee :
and , lo , thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice , and can play well on an instrument : for they hear thy words , but they do them not .
and he appointed certain of the levites to minister before the ark of the lord , and to record , and to thank and praise the lord god of israel :
and he dealt to every one of israel , both man and woman , to every one a loaf of bread , and a good piece of flesh , and a flagon of wine .
observe the month of abib , and keep the passover unto the lord thy god : for in the month of abib the lord thy god brought thee forth out of egypt by night .
so they brought the ark of god , and set it in the midst of the tent that david had pitched for it : and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before god .
thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the lord thy god , of the flock and the herd , in the place which the lord shall choose to place his name there .
son of man , they that inhabit those wastes of the land of israel speak , saying , abraham was one , and he inherited the land : but we are many ; the land is given us for inheritance .
wherefore say unto them , thus saith the lord god ; ye eat with the blood , and lift up your eyes toward your idols , and shed blood : and shall ye possess the land ?
now the hand of the lord was upon me in the evening , afore he that was escaped came ; and had opened my mouth , until he came to me in the morning ; and my mouth was opened , and i was no more dumb .
then the word of the lord came unto me , saying ,
yet ye say , the way of the lord is not equal . o ye house of israel , i will judge you every one after his ways .
and it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity , in the tenth month , in the fifth day of the month , that one that had escaped out of jerusalem came unto me , saying , the city is smitten .
for i will lay the land most desolate , and the pomp of her strength shall cease ; and the mountains of israel shall be desolate , that none shall pass through .
then shall they know that i am the lord , when i have laid the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed .
ye stand upon your sword , ye work abomination , and ye defile every one his neighbour ' s wife : and shall ye possess the land ?
therefore , o thou son of man , speak unto the house of israel ; thus ye speak , saying , if our transgressions and our sins be upon us , and we pine away in them , how should we then live ?
and hath seen in a vision a man named ananias coming in , and putting his hand on him , that he might receive his sight .
say unto them , as i live , saith the lord god , i have no pleasure in the death of the wicked ; but that the wicked turn from his way and live : turn ye , turn ye from your evil ways ; for why will ye die , o house of israel ?
then ananias answered , lord , i have heard by many of this man , how much evil he hath done to thy saints at jerusalem :
and the lord said unto him , arise , and go into the street which is called straight , and inquire in the house of judas for one called saul , of tarsus : for , behold , he prayeth ,
again , when i say unto the wicked , thou shalt surely die ; if he turn from his sin , and do that which is lawful and right ;
if the wicked restore the pledge , give again that he had robbed , walk in the statutes of life , without committing iniquity ; he shall surely live , he shall not die .
none of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him : he hath done that which is lawful and right ; he shall surely live .
yet the children of thy people say , the way of the lord is not equal : but as for them , their way is not equal .
when the righteous turneth from his righteousness , and committeth iniquity , he shall even die thereby .
but if the wicked turn from his wickedness , and do that which is lawful and right , he shall live thereby .
he that is despised , and hath a servant , is better than he that honoureth himself , and lacketh bread .
a man shall be commended according to his wisdom : but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised .
whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge : but he that hateth reproof is brutish .
a man shall not be established by wickedness : but the root of the righteous shall not be moved .
a good man obtaineth favour of the lord : but a man of wicked devices will he condemn .
the thoughts of the righteous are right : but the counsels of the wicked are deceit .
a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband : but she that maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones .
the wicked are overthrown , and are not : but the house of the righteous shall stand .
the words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood : but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them .
when thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity , thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth : surely every man is vanity . selah .
hear my prayer , o lord , and give ear unto my cry ; hold not thy peace at my tears : for i am a stranger with thee , and a sojourner , as all my fathers were .
o spare me , that i may recover strength , before i go hence , and be no more .
remove thy stroke away from me : i am consumed by the blow of thine hand .
and thou shalt make for the hanging five pillars of shittim wood , and overlay them with gold , and their hooks shall be of gold : and thou shalt cast five sockets of brass for them .
and thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of shittim wood overlaid with gold : their hooks shall be of gold , upon the four sockets of silver .
and moses did as the lord commanded him : and he took joshua , and set him before eleazar the priest , and before all the congregation :
and thou shalt make a vail of blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen of cunning work : with cherubims shall it be made :
and he shall stand before eleazar the priest , who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of urim before the lord : at his word shall they go out , and at his word they shall come in , both he , and all the children of israel with him , even all the congregation .
and thou shalt rear up the tabernacle according to the fashion thereof which was shewed thee in the mount .
and he laid his hands upon him , and gave him a charge , as the lord commanded by the hand of moses .
and thou shalt make an hanging for the door of the tent , of blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen , wrought with needlework .
and thou shalt set the table without the vail , and the candlestick over against the table on the side of the tabernacle toward the south : and thou shalt put the table on the north side .
and thou shalt put the mercy seat upon the ark of the testimony in the most holy place .
and thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him , that all the congregation of the children of israel may be obedient .
and thou shalt hang up the vail under the taches , that thou mayest bring in thither within the vail the ark of the testimony : and the vail shall divide unto you between the holy place and the most holy .
take good heed therefore unto yourselves , that ye love the lord your god .
one man of you shall chase a thousand : for the lord your god , he it is that fighteth for you , as he hath promised you .
else if ye do in any wise go back , and cleave unto the remnant of these nations , even these that remain among you , and shall make marriages with them , and go in unto them , and they to you :
therefore it shall come to pass , that as all good things are come upon you , which the lord your god promised you ; so shall the lord bring upon you all evil things , until he have destroyed you from off this good land which the lord your god hath given you .
when ye have transgressed the covenant of the lord your god , which he commanded you , and have gone and served other gods , and bowed yourselves to them ; then shall the anger of the lord be kindled against you , and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you .
and set him before eleazar the priest , and before all the congregation ; and give him a charge in their sight .
and the lord said unto moses , take thee joshua the son of nun , a man in whom is the spirit , and lay thine hand upon him ;
which may go out before them , and which may go in before them , and which may lead them out , and which may bring them in ; that the congregation of the lord be not as sheep which have no shepherd .
let the lord , the god of the spirits of all flesh , set a man over the congregation ,
and moses spake unto the lord , saying ,
for ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of zin , in the strife of the congregation , to sanctify me at the water before their eyes : that is the water of meribah in kadesh in the wilderness of zin .
and when thou hast seen it , thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people , as aaron thy brother was gathered .
and the lord said unto moses , get thee up into this mount abarim , and see the land which i have given unto the children of israel .
and if his father have no brethren , then ye shall give his inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family , and he shall possess it : and it shall be unto the children of israel a statute of judgment , as the lord commanded moses .
and if he have no brethren , then ye shall give his inheritance unto his father ' s brethren .
and thou shalt make forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards ; two sockets under one board for his two tenons , and two sockets under another board for his two tenons .
two tenons shall there be in one board , set in order one against another : thus shalt thou make for all the boards of the tabernacle .
and thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle , twenty boards on the south side southward .
and thou shalt make boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood standing up .
ten cubits shall be the length of a board , and a cubit and a half shall be the breadth of one board .
all the families that remain , every family apart , and their wives apart .
the family of the house of levi apart , and their wives apart ; the family of shimei apart , and their wives apart ;
and the land shall mourn , every family apart ; the family of the house of david apart , and their wives apart ; the family of the house of nathan apart , and their wives apart ;
in that day shall there be a great mourning in jerusalem , as the mourning of hadadrimmon in the valley of megiddon .
and thou shalt make a covering for the tent of rams ' skins dyed red , and a covering above of badgers ' skins .
and a cubit on the one side , and a cubit on the other side of that which remaineth in the length of the curtains of the tent , it shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle on this side and on that side , to cover it .
and the remnant that remaineth of the curtains of the tent , the half curtain that remaineth , shall hang over the backside of the tabernacle .
and thou shalt make fifty taches of brass , and put the taches into the loops , and couple the tent together , that it may be one .
and thou shalt make fifty loops on the edge of the one curtain that is outmost in the coupling , and fifty loops in the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second .
and david said , is there yet any that is left of the house of saul , that i may shew him kindness for jonathan ' s sake ?
and there was of the house of saul a servant whose name was ziba . and when they had called him unto david , the king said unto him , art thou ziba ? and he said , thy servant is he .
and the king said , is there not yet any of the house of saul , that i may shew the kindness of god unto him ? and ziba said unto the king , jonathan hath yet a son , which is lame on his feet .
and thou shalt make bars of shittim wood ; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle ,
and the king said unto him , where is he ? and ziba said unto the king , behold , he is in the house of machir , the son of ammiel , in lo - debar .
and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle , and five bars for the boards of the side of the tabernacle , for the two sides westward .
and the middle bar in the midst of the boards shall reach from end to end .
now when mephibosheth , the son of jonathan , the son of saul , was come unto david , he fell on his face , and did reverence . and david said , mephibosheth . and he answered , behold thy servant !
and thou shalt overlay the boards with gold , and make their rings of gold for places for the bars : and thou shalt overlay the bars with gold .
and he bowed himself , and said , what is thy servant , that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as i am ?
then the king called to ziba , saul ' s servant , and said unto him , i have given unto thy master ' s son all that pertained to saul and to all his house .
and two boards shalt thou make for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides .
and for the sides of the tabernacle westward thou shalt make six boards .
and they shall be eight boards , and their sockets of silver , sixteen sockets ; two sockets under one board , and two sockets under another board .
and they shall be coupled together beneath , and they shall be coupled together above the head of it unto one ring : thus shall it be for them both ; they shall be for the two corners .
and their forty sockets of silver ; two sockets under one board , and two sockets under another board .
and for the second side of the tabernacle on the north side there shall be twenty boards :
and when moses heard that , he was content .
be thou exalted , lord , in thine own strength : so will we sing and praise thy power .
therefore shalt thou make them turn their back , when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them .
for they intended evil against thee : they imagined a mischievous device , which they are not able to perform .
their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth , and their seed from among the children of men .
and ye shall eat it in the holy place , because it is thy due , and thy sons ' due , of the sacrifices of the lord made by fire : for so i am commanded .
and the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place ; thou , and thy sons , and thy daughters with thee : for they be thy due , and thy sons ' due , which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of israel .
the heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat , to wave it for a wave offering before the lord ; and it shall be thine , and thy sons ' with thee , by a statute for ever ; as the lord hath commanded .
and moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering , and , behold , it was burnt : and he was angry with eleazar and ithamar , the sons of aaron which were left alive , saying ,
and that ye may put difference between holy and unholy , and between unclean and clean ;
and moses spake unto aaron , and unto eleazar and unto ithamar , his sons that were left , take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the lord made by fire , and eat it without leaven beside the altar : for it is most holy :
wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place , seeing it is most holy , and god hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation , to make atonement for them before the lord ?
behold , the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place : ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place , as i commanded .
and aaron said unto moses , behold , this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the lord ; and such things have befallen me : and if i had eaten the sin offering to day , should it have been accepted in the sight of the lord ?
( beforetime in israel , when a man went to inquire of god , thus he spake , come , and let us go to the seer : for he that is now called a prophet was beforetime called a seer . )
and the servant answered saul again , and said , behold , i have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver : that will i give to the man of god , to tell us our way .
now there was a man of benjamin , whose name was kish , the son of abiel , the son of zeror , the son of bechorath , the son of aphiah , a benjamite , a mighty man of power .
he taketh it with his eyes : his nose pierceth through snares .
behold , he drinketh up a river , and hasteth not : he trusteth that he can draw up jordan into his mouth .
and the asses of kish saul ' s father were lost . and kish said to saul his son , take now one of the servants with thee , and arise , go seek the asses .
the shady trees cover him with their shadow ; the willows of the brook compass him about .
and he had a son , whose name was saul , a choice young man , and a goodly : and there was not among the children of israel a goodlier person than he : from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people .
he lieth under the shady trees , in the covert of the reed , and fens .
and when they were come to the land of zuph , saul said to his servant that was with him , come , and let us return ; lest my father leave caring for the asses , and take thought for us .
surely the mountains bring him forth food , where all the beasts of the field play .
then said saul to his servant , but , behold , if we go , what shall we bring the man ? for the bread is spent in our vessels , and there is not a present to bring to the man of god : what have we ?
and he said unto him , behold now , there is in this city a man of god , and he is an honourable man ; all that he saith cometh surely to pass : now let us go thither ; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go .
behold now behemoth , which i made with thee ; he eateth grass as an ox .
then will i also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee .
he moveth his tail like a cedar : the sinews of his stones are wrapped together .
lo now , his strength is in his loins , and his force is in the navel of his belly .
he is the chief of the ways of god : he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him .
his bones are as strong pieces of brass ; his bones are like bars of iron .
and ye also shall bear witness , because ye have been with me from the beginning .
but when the comforter is come , whom i will send unto you from the father , even the spirit of truth , which proceedeth from the father , he shall testify of me :
but this cometh to pass , that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law , they hated me without a cause .
if i had not done among them the works which none other man did , they had not had sin : but now have they both seen and hated both me and my father .
he that hateth me hateth my father also .
if i had not come and spoken unto them , they had not had sin : but now they have no cloke for their sin .
cast abroad the rage of thy wrath : and behold every one that is proud , and abase him .
but all these things will they do unto you for my name ' s sake , because they know not him that sent me .
deck thyself now with majesty and excellency ; and array thyself with glory and beauty .
remember the word that i said unto you , the servant is not greater than his lord . if they have persecuted me , they will also persecute you ; if they have kept my saying , they will keep yours also .
hide them in the dust together ; and bind their faces in secret .
who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed , that could deliver his people out of mine hand , that your god should be able to deliver you out of mine hand ?
know ye not what i and my fathers have done unto all the people of other lands ? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand ?
hath not the same hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars , and commanded judah and jerusalem , saying , ye shall worship before one altar , and burn incense upon it ?
thus saith sennacherib king of assyria , whereon do ye trust , that ye abide in the siege in jerusalem ?
these things i command you , that ye love one another .
ye have not chosen me , but i have chosen you , and ordained you , that ye should go and bring forth fruit , and that your fruit should remain : that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name , he may give it you .
if ye were of the world , the world would love his own : but because ye are not of the world , but i have chosen you out of the world , therefore the world hateth you .
if the world hate you , ye know that it hated me before it hated you .
greater love hath no man than this , that a man lay down his life for his friends .
this is my commandment , that ye love one another , as i have loved you .
henceforth i call you not servants ; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth : but i have called you friends ; for all things that i have heard of my father i have made known unto you .
and they spake against the god of jerusalem , as against the gods of the people of the earth , which were the work of the hands of man .
ye are my friends , if ye do whatsoever i command you .
he wrote also letters to rail on the lord god of israel , and to speak against him , saying , as the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand , so shall not the god of hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand .
then they cried with a loud voice in the jews ' speech unto the people of jerusalem that were on the wall , to affright them , and to trouble them ; that they might take the city .
if ye keep my commandments , ye shall abide in my love ; even as i have kept my father ' s commandments , and abide in his love .
then agrippa said unto paul , thou art permitted to speak for thyself . then paul stretched forth the hand , and answered for himself :
and now i stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of god unto our fathers :
unto which promise our twelve tribes , instantly serving god day and night , hope to come . for which hope ' s sake , king agrippa , i am accused of the jews .
why should it be thought a thing incredible with you , that god should raise the dead ?
i verily thought with myself , that i ought to do many things contrary to the name of jesus of nazareth .
i think myself happy , king agrippa , because i shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof i am accused of the jews :
especially because i know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the jews : wherefore i beseech thee to hear me patiently .
my manner of life from my youth , which was at the first among mine own nation at jerusalem , know all the jews ;
which knew me from the beginning , if they would testify , that after the most straitest sect of our religion i lived a pharisee .
and they called them , and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of jesus .
but that it spread no further among the people , let us straitly threaten them , that they speak henceforth to no man in this name .
and beholding the man which was healed standing with them , they could say nothing against it .
take therefore no thought for the morrow : for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself . sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof .
now when they saw the boldness of peter and john , and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men , they marvelled ; and they took knowledge of them , that they had been with jesus .
saying , what shall we do to these men ? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in jerusalem ; and we cannot deny it .
( for after all these things do the gentiles seek : ) for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things .
but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council , they conferred among themselves ,
therefore take no thought , saying , what shall we eat ? or , what shall we drink ? or , wherewithal shall we be clothed ?
be it known unto you all , and to all the people of israel , that by the name of jesus christ of nazareth , whom ye crucified , whom god raised from the dead , even by him doth this man stand here before you whole .
neither is there salvation in any other : for there is none other name under heaven given among men , whereby we must be saved .
this is the stone which was set at nought of you builders , which is become the head of the corner .
wherefore , if god so clothe the grass of the field , which to day is , and to morrow is cast into the oven , shall he not much more clothe you , o ye of little faith ?
the troubles of my heart are enlarged : o bring thou me out of my distresses .
turn thee unto me , and have mercy upon me ; for i am desolate and afflicted .
and now , lord , behold their threatenings : and grant unto thy servants , that with all boldness they may speak thy word ,
consider mine enemies ; for they are many ; and they hate me with cruel hatred .
for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done .
look upon mine affliction and my pain ; and forgive all my sins .
his soul shall dwell at ease ; and his seed shall inherit the earth .
what man is he that feareth the lord ? him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose .
mine eyes are ever toward the lord ; for he shall pluck my feet out of the net .
the secret of the lord is with them that fear him ; and he will shew them his covenant .
and being let go , they went to their own company , and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them .
for the man was above forty years old , on whom this miracle of healing was shewed .
so when they had further threatened them , they let them go , finding nothing how they might punish them , because of the people : for all men glorified god for that which was done .
for we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard .
for of a truth against thy holy child jesus , whom thou hast anointed , both herod , and pontius pilate , with the gentiles , and the people of israel , were gathered together ,
who by the mouth of thy servant david hast said , why did the heathen rage , and the people imagine vain things ?
and when they heard that , they lifted up their voice to god with one accord , and said , lord , thou art god , which hast made heaven , and earth , and the sea , and all that in them is :
by stretching forth thine hand to heal ; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child jesus .
yet was she carried away , she went into captivity : her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets : and they cast lots for her honourable men , and all her great men were bound in chains .

for thy name ' s sake , o lord , pardon mine iniquity ; for it is great .
there is no healing of thy bruise ; thy wound is grievous : all that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee : for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually ?
the sons also of hezron , that were born unto him ; jerahmeel , and ram , and chelubai .
and the sons of ethan ; azariah .
and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul : neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own ; but they had all things common .
and the sons of carmi ; achar , the troubler of israel , who transgressed in the thing accursed .
all thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with the firstripe figs : if they be shaken , they shall even fall into the mouth of the eater .

and the sons of zerah ; zimri , and ethan , and heman , and calcol , and dara : five of them in all .
thou also shalt be drunken : thou shalt be hid , thou also shalt seek strength because of the enemy .
neither was there any among them that lacked : for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them , and brought the prices of the things that were sold ,
the sons of pharez ; hezron , and hamul .
draw thee waters for the siege , fortify thy strong holds : go into clay , and tread the morter , make strong the brickkiln .
and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the lord jesus : and great grace was upon them all .

the sons of judah ; er , and onan , and shelah : which three were born unto him of the daughter of shua the canaanitess . and er , the firstborn of judah , was evil in the sight of the lord ; and he slew him .
thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven : the cankerworm spoileth , and flieth away .
and laid them down at the apostles ' feet : and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need .
dan , joseph , and benjamin , naphtali , gad , and asher .
there shall the fire devour thee ; the sword shall cut thee off , it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm : make thyself many as the cankerworm , make thyself many as the locusts .
these are the sons of israel ; reuben , simeon , levi , and judah , issachar , and zebulun ,
thy shepherds slumber , o king of assyria : thy nobles shall dwell in the dust : thy people is scattered upon the mountains , and no man gathereth them .
having land , sold it , and brought the money , and laid it at the apostles ' feet .
thy crowned are as the locusts , and thy captains as the great grasshoppers , which camp in the hedges in the cold day , but when the sun ariseth they flee away , and their place is not known where they are .
and this shall be the priest ' s due from the people , from them that offer a sacrifice , whether it be ox or sheep ; and they shall give unto the priest the shoulder , and the two cheeks , and the maw .
the firstfruit also of thy corn , of thy wine , and of thine oil , and the first of the fleece of thy sheep , shalt thou give him .
the priests the levites , and all the tribe of levi , shall have no part nor inheritance with israel : they shall eat the offerings of the lord made by fire , and his inheritance .
therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren : the lord is their inheritance , as he hath said unto them .
then he shall minister in the name of the lord his god , as all his brethren the levites do , which stand there before the lord .
for thine arrows stick fast in me , and thy hand presseth me sore .
they shall have like portions to eat , beside that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony .

and if a levite come from any of thy gates out of all israel , where he sojourned , and come with all the desire of his mind unto the place which the lord shall choose ;
there is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger ; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin .
let integrity and uprightness preserve me ; for i wait on thee .
i am troubled ; i am bowed down greatly ; i go mourning all the day long .
redeem israel , o god , out of all his troubles .
my wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness .
when thou art come into the land which the lord thy god giveth thee , thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations .
i am feeble and sore broken : i have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart .

for my loins are filled with a loathsome disease : and there is no soundness in my flesh .

and his firstborn son abdon , and zur , and kish , and baal , and nadab ,
and there shall be no night there ; and they need no candle , neither light of the sun ; for the lord god giveth them light : and they shall reign for ever and ever .

and ner begat kish , and kish begat saul , and saul begat jonathan , and malchi - shua , and abinadab , and esh - baal .
and the son of jonathan was merib - baal ; and merib - baal begat micah .
and gedor , and ahio , and zacher .
and mikloth begat shimeah . and these also dwelt with their brethren in jerusalem , over against them .
and moza begat binea : rapha was his son , eleasah his son , azel his son :

but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven , where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt , and where thieves do not break through nor steal :
arise , o lord , into thy rest ; thou , and the ark of thy strength .
lord , remember david , and all his afflictions :

and yet i say unto you , that even solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these .
o israel , thou hast destroyed thyself ; but in me is thine help .
i will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps , and will rend the caul of their heart , and there will i devour them like a lion : the wild beast shall tear them .

for thy servant doth know that i have sinned : therefore , behold , i am come the first this day of all the house of joseph to go down to meet my lord the king .
and he answered , my lord , o king , my servant deceived me : for thy servant said , i will saddle me an ass , that i may ride thereon , and go to the king ; because thy servant is lame .
and he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king ; but my lord the king is as an angel of god : do therefore what is good in thine eyes .
for all of my father ' s house were but dead men before my lord the king : yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table . what right therefore have i yet to cry any more unto the king ?
thy servant will go a little way over jordan with the king : and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward ?
i am this day fourscore years old : and can i discern between good and evil ? can thy servant taste what i eat or what i drink ? can i hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women ? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king ?
and barzillai said unto the king , how long have i to live , that i should go up with the king unto jerusalem ?
and the king said unto barzillai , come thou over with me , and i will feed thee with me in jerusalem .
now barzillai was a very aged man , even fourscore years old : and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at mahanaim ; for he was a very great man .
and barzillai the gileadite came down from rogelim , and went over jordan with the king , to conduct him over jordan .
and mephibosheth said unto the king , yea , let him take all , forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house .
and all the people went over jordan . and when the king was come over , the king kissed barzillai , and blessed him ; and he returned unto his own place .
and the king answered , chimham shall go over with me , and i will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee : and whatsoever thou shalt require of me , that will i do for thee .
bless them which persecute you : bless , and curse not .
rejoice with them that do rejoice , and weep with them that weep .
rejoicing in hope ; patient in tribulation ; continuing instant in prayer ;
distributing to the necessity of saints ; given to hospitality .
be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love ; in honour preferring one another ;
not slothful in business ; fervent in spirit ; serving the lord ;
and saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves , and they came to the battle : and , behold , every man ' s sword was against his fellow , and there was a very great discomfiture .
and he said , cursed be canaan ; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren .
and he said , blessed be the lord god of shem ; and canaan shall be his servant .
and shem and japheth took a garment , and laid it upon both their shoulders , and went backward , and covered the nakedness of their father ; and their faces were backward , and they saw not their father ' s nakedness .
and noah awoke from his wine , and knew what his younger son had done unto him .
if it be possible , as much as lieth in you , live peaceably with all men .
and all the days of noah were nine hundred and fifty years : and he died .
dearly beloved , avenge not yourselves , but rather give place unto wrath : for it is written , vengeance is mine ; i will repay , saith the lord .
be of the same mind one toward another . mind not high things , but condescend to men of low estate . be not wise in your own conceits .
god shall enlarge japheth , and he shall dwell in the tents of shem ; and canaan shall be his servant .
recompense to no man evil for evil . provide things honest in the sight of all men .
and noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years .
and of gad he said , blessed be he that enlargeth gad : he dwelleth as a lion , and teareth the arm with the crown of the head .
and he provided the first part for himself , because there , in a portion of the lawgiver , was he seated ; and he came with the heads of the people , he executed the justice of the lord , and his judgments with israel .
likewise all the men of israel which had hid themselves in mount ephraim , when they heard that the philistines fled , even they also followed hard after them in the battle .
and of dan he said , dan is a lion ' s whelp : he shall leap from bashan .
so the lord saved israel that day : and the battle passed over unto beth - aven .
and of naphtali he said , o naphtali , satisfied with favour , and full with the blessing of the lord : possess thou the west and the south .
and the men of israel were distressed that day : for saul had adjured the people , saying , cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening , that i may be avenged on mine enemies . so none of the people tasted any food .
and of asher he said , let asher be blessed with children ; let him be acceptable to his brethren , and let him dip his foot in oil .
and all they of the land came to a wood ; and there was honey upon the ground .
thy shoes shall be iron and brass ; and as thy days , so shall thy strength be .
and when the people were come into the wood , behold , the honey dropped ; but no man put his hand to his mouth : for the people feared the oath .
there is none like unto the god of jeshurun , who rideth upon the heaven in thy help , and in his excellency on the sky .
but jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath : wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand , and dipped it in an honeycomb , and put his hand to his mouth ; and his eyes were enlightened .
the eternal god is thy refuge , and underneath are the everlasting arms : and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee ; and shall say , destroy them .
israel then shall dwell in safety alone : the fountain of jacob shall be upon a land of corn and wine ; also his heavens shall drop down dew .
then said jonathan , my father hath troubled the land : see , i pray you , how mine eyes have been enlightened , because i tasted a little of this honey .
happy art thou , o israel : who is like unto thee , o people saved by the lord , the shield of thy help , and who is the sword of thy excellency ! and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee ; and thou shalt tread upon their high places .
but if they say thus , come up unto us ; then we will go up : for the lord hath delivered them into our hand : and this shall be a sign unto us .
so that i come again to my father ' s house in peace ; then shall the lord be my god :
therefore if thine enemy hunger , feed him ; if he thirst , give him drink : for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head .
and jacob vowed a vow , saying , if god will be with me , and will keep me in this way that i go , and will give me bread to eat , and raiment to put on ,
and this stone , which i have set for a pillar , shall be god ' s house : and of all that thou shalt give me i will surely give the tenth unto thee .
now therefore make a new cart , and take two milch kine , on which there hath come no yoke , and tie the kine to the cart , and bring their calves home from them :
and god said , this is the token of the covenant which i make between me and you and every living creature that is with you , for perpetual generations :
and take the ark of the lord , and lay it upon the cart ; and put the jewels of gold , which ye return him for a trespass offering , in a coffer by the side thereof ; and send it away , that it may go .
i do set my bow in the cloud , and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth .
and see , if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to beth - shemesh , then he hath done us this great evil : but if not , then we shall know that is not his hand that smote us ; it was a chance that happened to us .
and it shall come to pass , when i bring a cloud over the earth , that the bow shall be seen in the cloud :
and i will remember my covenant , which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh ; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh .
and they said , if ye send away the ark of the god of israel , send it not empty ; but in any wise return him a trespass offering : then ye shall be healed , and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you .
and the bow shall be in the cloud ; and i will look upon it , that i may remember the everlasting covenant between god and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth .
then said they , what shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him ? they answered , five golden emerods , and five golden mice , according to the number of the lords of the philistines : for one plague was on you all , and on your lords .
and god said unto noah , this is the token of the covenant , which i have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth .
wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods , and images of your mice that mar the land ; and ye shall give glory unto the god of israel : peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you , and from off your gods , and from off your land .
and the sons of noah , that went forth of the ark , were shem , and ham , and japheth : and ham is the father of canaan .
wherefore then do ye harden your hearts , as the egyptians and pharoah hardened their hearts ? when he had wrought wonderfully among them , did they not let the people go , and they departed ?
these are the three sons of noah : and of them was the whole earth overspread .
and it came to pass , while saul talked unto the priest , that the noise that was in the host of the philistines went on and increased : and saul said unto the priest , withdraw thine hand .
and noah began to be an husbandman , and he planted a vineyard :
and ham , the father of canaan , saw the nakedness of his father , and told his two brethren without .
and jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet , and his armourbearer after him : and they fell before jonathan ; and his armourbearer slew after him .
and , behold , the lord stood above it , and said , i am the lord god of abraham thy father , and the god of isaac : the land whereon thou liest , to thee will i give it , and to thy seed ;
and that first slaughter , which jonathan and his armourbearer made , was about twenty men , within as it were an half acre of land , which a yoke of oxen might plow .
and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth , and thou shalt spread abroad to the west , and to the east , and to the north , and to the south : and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed .
and both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the philistines : and the philistines said , behold , the hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves .
and , behold , i am with thee , and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest , and will bring thee again into this land ; for i will not leave thee , until i have done that which i have spoken to thee of .
and the men of the garrison answered jonathan and his armourbearer , and said , come up to us , and we will shew you a thing . and jonathan said unto his armourbearer , come up after me : for the lord hath delivered them into the hand of israel .
and jacob awaked out of his sleep , and he said , surely the lord is in this place ; and i knew it not .
then said saul unto the people that were with him , number now , and see who is gone from us . and when they had numbered , behold , jonathan and his armourbearer were not there .
and he was afraid , and said , how dreadful is this place ! this is none other but the house of god , and this is the gate of heaven .
and saul said unto ahiah , bring hither the ark of god . for the ark of god was at that time with the children of israel .
and jacob rose up early in the morning , and took the stone that he had put for his pillows , and set it up for a pillar , and poured oil upon the top of it .
and there was trembling in the host , in the field , and among all the people : the garrison , and the spoilers , they also trembled , and the earth quaked : so it was a very great trembling .
and he called the name of that place bethel : but the name of that city was called luz at the first .
and the watchmen of saul in gibeah of benjamin looked ; and , behold , the multitude melted away , and they went on beating down one another .
and he called the name of the first , jemima ; and the name of the second , kezia ; and the name of the third , keren - happuch .
and in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of job : and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren .
so the lord blessed the latter end of job more than his beginning : for he had fourteen thousand sheep , and six thousand camels , and a thousand yoke of oxen , and a thousand she asses .
he had also seven sons and three daughters .
and the lord turned the captivity of job , when he prayed for his friends : also the lord gave job twice as much as he had before .
after this lived job an hundred and forty years , and saw his sons , and his sons ' sons , even four generations .
so job died , being old and full of days .
and the philistines called for the priests and the diviners , saying , what shall we do to the ark of the lord ? tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place .
and the ark of the lord was in the country of the philistines seven months .
and if the lord thy god enlarge thy coast , as he hath sworn unto thy fathers , and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto thy fathers ;
if thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them , which i command thee this day , to love the lord thy god , and to walk ever in his ways ; then shalt thou add three cities more for thee , beside these three :
lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer , while his heart is hot , and overtake him , because the way is long , and slay him ; whereas he was not worthy of death , inasmuch as he hated him not in time past .
wherefore i command thee , saying , thou shalt separate three cities for thee .
and this is the case of the slayer , which shall flee thither , that he may live : whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly , whom he hated not in time past ;
as when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood , and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree , and the head slippeth from the helve , and lighteth upon his neighbour , that he die ; he shall flee unto one of those cities , and live :
thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land , which the lord thy god giveth thee to possess it .
thou shalt prepare thee a way , and divide the coasts of thy land , which the lord thy god giveth thee to inherit , into three parts , that every slayer may flee thither .
when the lord thy god hath cut off the nations , whose land the lord thy god giveth thee , and thou succeedest them , and dwellest in their cities , and in their houses ;
but when paul perceived that the one part were sadducees , and the other pharisees , he cried out in the council , men and brethren , i am a pharisee , the son of a pharisee : of the hope and resurrection of the dead i am called in question .
and amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway . and when the man saw that all the people stood still , he removed amasa out of the highway into the field , and cast a cloth upon him , when he saw that every one that came by him stood still .
then said paul , i wist not , brethren , that he was the high priest : for it is written , thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people .
for the sadducees say that there is no resurrection , neither angel , nor spirit : but the pharisees confess both .
but amasa took no heed to the sword that was in joab ' s hand : so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib , and shed out his bowels to the ground , and struck him not again ; and he died . so joab and abishai his brother pursued after sheba the son of bichri .
and when he had so said , there arose a dissension between the pharisees and the sadducees : and the multitude was divided .
and there arose a great cry : and the scribes that were of the pharisees ' part arose , and strove , saying , we find no evil in this man : but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him , let us not fight against god .
i am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in israel : thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in israel : why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the lord ?
then she spake , saying , they were wont to speak in old time , saying , they shall surely ask counsel at abel : and so they ended the matter .
and when he was come near unto her , the woman said , art thou joab ? and he answered , i am he . then she said unto him , hear the words of thine handmaid . and he answered , i do hear .
and they came and besieged him in abel of beth - maachah , and they cast up a bank against the city , and it stood in the trench : and all the people that were with joab battered the wall , to throw it down .
and he went through all the tribes of israel unto abel , and to beth - maachah , and all the berites : and they were gathered together , and went also after him .
when he was removed out of the highway , all the people went on after joab , to pursue after sheba the son of bichri .
and paul , earnestly beholding the council , said , men and brethren , i have lived in all good conscience before god until this day .
and the high priest ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth .
then said paul unto him , god shall smite thee , thou whited wall : for sittest thou to judge me after the law , and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law ?
and they that stood by said , revilest thou god ' s high priest ?
and joab answered and said , far be it , far be it from me , that i should swallow up or destroy .
now joab was over all the host of israel : and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over the cherethites and over the pelethites :
then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom . and they cut off the head of sheba the son of bichri , and cast it out to joab . and he blew a trumpet , and they retired from the city , every man to his tent . and joab returned to jerusalem unto the king .
and sheva was scribe : and zadok and abiathar were the priests :
and adoram was over the tribute : and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud was recorder :
and ira also the jairite was a chief ruler about david .
jesus answered , he it is , to whom i shall give a sop , when i have dipped it . and when he had dipped the sop , he gave it to judas iscariot , the son of simon .
he then lying on jesus ' breast saith unto him , lord , who is it ?
now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him .
and after the sop satan entered into him . then said jesus unto him , that thou doest , do quickly .
for some of them thought , because judas had the bag , that jesus had said unto him , buy those things that we have need of against the feast ; or , that he should give something to the poor .
verily , verily , i say unto you , he that receiveth whomsoever i send receiveth me ; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me .
then the disciples looked one on another , doubting of whom he spake .
when jesus had thus said , he was troubled in spirit , and testified , and said , verily , verily , i say unto you , that one of you shall betray me .
simon peter therefore beckoned to him , that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake .
now there was leaning on jesus ' bosom one of his disciples , whom jesus loved .
so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth : it shall not return unto me void , but it shall accomplish that which i please , and it shall prosper in the thing whereto i sent it .
for as the rain cometh down , and the snow from heaven , and returneth not thither , but watereth the earth , and maketh it bring forth and bud , that it may give seed to the sower , and bread to the eater :
for ye shall go out with joy , and be led forth with peace : the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing , and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands .
if ye know these things , happy are ye if ye do them .
verily , verily , i say unto you , the servant is not greater than his lord ; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him .
for i have given you an example , that ye should do as i have done to you .
if i then , your lord and master , have washed your feet ; ye also ought to wash one another ' s feet .
now i tell you before it come , that , when it is come to pass , ye may believe that i am he .
i speak not of you all : i know whom i have chosen : but that the scripture may be fulfilled , he that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me .
ye call me master and lord : and ye say well ; for so i am .
so after he had washed their feet , and had taken his garments , and was set down again , he said unto them , know ye what i have done to you ?
for he knew who should betray him ; therefore said he , ye are not all clean .
they shall call the people unto the mountain ; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness : for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas , and of treasures hid in the sand .
jesus saith to him , he that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet , but is clean every whit : and ye are clean , but not all .
and of zebulun he said , rejoice , zebulun , in thy going out ; and , issachar , in thy tents .
his glory is like the firstling of his bullock , and his horns are like the horns of unicorns : with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth : and they are the ten thousands of ephraim , and they are the thousands of manasseh .
and for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof , and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush : let the blessing come upon the head of joseph , and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren .
and for the chief things of the ancient mountains , and for the precious things of the lasting hills ,
and for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun , and for the precious things put forth by the moon ,
and of joseph he said , blessed of the lord be his land , for the precious things of heaven , for the dew , and for the deep that coucheth beneath ,
and of benjamin he said , the beloved of the lord shall dwell in safety by him ; and the lord shall cover him all the day long , and he shall dwell between his shoulders .
bless , lord , his substance , and accept the work of his hands : smite through the loins of them that rise against him , and of them that hate him , that they rise not again .
they shall teach jacob thy judgments , and israel thy law : they shall put incense before thee , and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar .
the works of his hands are verity and judgment ; all his commandments are sure .
they stand fast for ever and ever , and are done in truth and uprightness .
and i will say to my soul , soul , thou hast much goods laid up for many years ; take thine ease , eat , drink , and be merry .
he hath given meat unto them that fear him : he will ever be mindful of his covenant .
and he said , this will i do : i will pull down my barns , and build greater ; and there will i bestow all my fruits and my goods .
he hath shewed his people the power of his works , that he may give them the heritage of the heathen .
and he thought within himself , saying , what shall i do , because i have no room where to bestow my fruits ?
his work is honourable and glorious : and his righteousness endureth for ever .
and he spake a parable unto them , saying , the ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully :
he hath made his wonderful works to be remembered : the lord is gracious and full of compassion .
and he said unto them , take heed , and beware of covetousness : for a man ' s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth .
praise ye the lord . i will praise the lord with my whole heart , in the assembly of the upright , and in the congregation .
and he said unto him , man , who made me a judge or a divider over you ?
the works of the lord are great , sought out of all them that have pleasure therein .
and one of the company said unto him , master , speak to my brother , that he divide the inheritance with me .
for the holy ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say .
and when they bring you unto the synagogues , and unto magistrates , and powers , take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer , or what ye shall say :
and whosoever shall speak a word against the son of man , it shall be forgiven him : but unto him that blasphemeth against the holy ghost it shall not be forgiven .
lest thou learn his ways , and get a snare to thy soul .
be not thou one of them that strike hands , or of them that are sureties for debts .
remove not the ancient landmark , which thy fathers have set .
that i might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth ; that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee ?
for the lord will plead their cause , and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them .
make no friendship with an angry man ; and with a furious man thou shalt not go :
o sing unto the lord a new song ; for he hath done marvellous things : his right hand , and his holy arm , hath gotten him the victory .
the lord hath made known his salvation : his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen .
and they saw the god of israel : and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone , and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness .
seest thou a man diligent in his business ? he shall stand before kings ; he shall not stand before mean men .
and the lord said unto moses , come up to me into the mount , and be there : and i will give thee tables of stone , and a law , and commandments which i have written ; that thou mayest teach them .
and upon the nobles of the children of israel he laid not his hand : also they saw god , and did eat and drink .
if god be glorified in him , god shall also glorify him in himself , and shall straightway glorify him .
and moses rose up , and his minister joshua : and moses went up into the mount of god .
little children , yet a little while i am with you . ye shall seek me : and as i said unto the jews , whither i go , ye cannot come ; so now i say to you .
and he said unto the elders , tarry ye here for us , until we come again unto you : and , behold , aaron and hur are with you : if any man have any matters to do , let him come unto them .
a new commandment i give unto you , that ye love one another ; as i have loved you , that ye also love one another .
and moses went up into the mount , and a cloud covered the mount .
by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples , if ye have love one to another .
and the glory of the lord abode upon mount sinai , and the cloud covered it six days : and the seventh day he called unto moses out of the midst of the cloud .
and the sight of the glory of the lord was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of israel .
he then having received the sop went immediately out : and it was night .
therefore , when he was gone out , jesus said , now is the son of man glorified , and god is glorified in him .
simon peter said unto him , lord , whither goest thou ? jesus answered him , whither i go , thou canst not follow me now ; but thou shalt follow me afterwards .
peter said unto him , lord , why cannot i follow thee now ? i will lay down my life for thy sake .
jesus answered him , wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake ? verily , verily , i say unto thee , the cock shall not crow , till thou hast denied me thrice .
and my soul shall be joyful in the lord : it shall rejoice in his salvation .
let destruction come upon him at unawares ; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself : into that very destruction let him fall .
for without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit , which without cause they have digged for my soul .
let their way be dark and slippery : and let the angel of the lord persecute them .
he sent redemption unto his people : he hath commanded his covenant for ever : holy and reverend is his name .
let them be as chaff before the wind : and let the angel of the lord chase them .
let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul : let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt .
draw out also the spear , and stop the way against them that persecute me : say unto my soul , i am thy salvation .
take hold of shield and buckler , and stand up for mine help .
plead my cause , o lord , with them that strive with me : fight against them that fight against me .
ye hypocrites , ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth ; but how is it that ye do not discern this time ?
he shall spare the poor and needy , and shall save the souls of the needy .
for thus saith the lord concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place , and concerning their mothers that bare them , and concerning their fathers that begat them in this land ;
yea , and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right ?
for he shall deliver the needy when he crieth ; the poor also , and him that hath no helper .
thou shalt not take thee a wife , neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in this place .
and he said also to the people , when ye see a cloud rise out of the west , straightway ye say , there cometh a shower ; and so it is .
and he shall live , and to him shall be given of the gold of sheba : prayer also shall be made for him continually ; and daily shall he be praised .
for thus saith the lord , enter not into the house of mourning , neither go to lament nor bemoan them : for i have taken away my peace from this people , saith the lord , even lovingkindness and mercies .
and when ye see the south wind blow , ye say , there will be heat ; and it cometh to pass .
he shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence : and precious shall their blood be in his sight .
for from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided , three against two , and two against three .
his name shall endure for ever : his name shall be continued as long as the sun : and men shall be blessed in him : all nations shall call him blessed .
the father shall be divided against the son , and the son against the father ; the mother against the daughter , and the daughter against the mother ; the mother in law against her daughter in law , and the daughter in law against her mother in law .
there shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains ; the fruit thereof shall shake like lebanon : and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth .
but i have a baptism to be baptized with ; and how am i straitened till it be accomplished !
and blessed be his glorious name for ever : and let the whole earth be filled with his glory ; amen , and amen .
the word of the lord came also unto me , saying ,
suppose ye that i am come to give peace on earth ? i tell you , nay ; but rather division :
blessed be the lord god , the god of israel , who only doeth wondrous things .
curse not the king , no not in thy thought ; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber : for a bird of the air shall carry the voice , and that which hath wings shall tell the matter .
when thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate , as thou art in the way , give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him ; lest he hale thee to the judge , and the judge deliver thee to the officer , and the officer cast thee into prison .
and it came to pass , after he had buried him , that he spake to his sons , saying , when i am dead , then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of god is buried ; lay my bones beside his bones :
yea , all kings shall fall down before him : all nations shall serve him .
i tell thee , thou shalt not depart thence , till thou hast paid the very last mite .
and he laid his carcase in his own grave ; and they mourned over him , saying , alas , my brother !
the kings of tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents : the kings of sheba and seba shall offer gifts .
and he cried unto the man of god that came from judah , saying , thus saith the lord , forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the lord , and hast not kept the commandment which the lord thy god commanded thee ,
and it came to pass , after he had eaten bread , and after he had drunk , that he saddled for him the ass , to wit , for the prophet whom he had brought back .
and when he was gone , a lion met him by the way , and slew him : and his carcase was cast in the way , and the ass stood by it , the lion also stood by the carcase .
and , behold , men passed by , and saw the carcase cast in the way , and the lion standing by the carcase : and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt .
by much slothfulness the building decayeth ; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through .
and he spake to his sons , saying , saddle me the ass . and they saddled him .
a feast is made for laughter , and wine maketh merry : but money answereth all things .
and he went and found his carcase cast in the way , and the ass and the lion standing by the carcase : the lion had not eaten the carcase , nor torn the ass .
and the prophet took up the carcase of the man of god , and laid it upon the ass , and brought it back : and the old prophet came to the city , to mourn and to bury him .
both the great and the small shall die in this land : they shall not be buried , neither shall men lament for them , nor cut themselves , nor make themselves bald for them :
neither shall men tear themselves for them in mourning , to comfort them for the dead ; neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother .
thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting , to sit with them to eat and to drink .
for thus saith the lord of hosts , the god of israel ; behold , i will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes , and in your days , the voice of mirth , and the voice of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom , and the voice of the bride .
blessed is that servant , whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing .
of a truth i say unto you , that he will make him ruler over all that he hath .
but and if that servant say in his heart , my lord delayeth his coming ; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens , and to eat and drink , and to be drunken ;
be ye therefore ready also : for the son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not .
then peter said unto him , lord , speakest thou this parable unto us , or even to all ?
and the lord said , who then is that faithful and wise steward , whom his lord shall make ruler over his household , to give them their portion of meat in due season ?
i am come to send fire on the earth ; and what will i if it be already kindled ?
and their father said unto them , what way went he ? for his sons had seen what way the man of god went , which came from judah .
and he said unto his sons , saddle me the ass . so they saddled him the ass : and he rode thereon ,
so he went another way , and returned not by the way that he came to bethel .
now there dwelt an old prophet in bethel ; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of god had done that day in bethel : the words which he had spoken unto the king , them they told also to their father .
and he said , i may not return with thee , nor go in with thee : neither will i eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place :
for it was said to me by the word of the lord , thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there , nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest .
and went after the man of god , and found him sitting under an oak : and he said unto him , art thou the man of god that camest from judah ? and he said , i am .
then he said unto him , come home with me , and eat bread .
he said unto him , i am a prophet also as thou art ; and an angel spake unto me by the word of the lord , saying , bring him back with thee into thine house , that he may eat bread and drink water . but he lied unto him .
so he went back with him , and did eat bread in his house , and drank water .
and the name of saul ' s wife was ahinoam , the daughter of ahimaaz : and the name of the captain of his host was abner , the son of ner , saul ' s uncle .
and kish was the father of saul ; and ner the father of abner was the son of abiel .
and there was sore war against the philistines all the days of saul : and when saul saw any strong man , or any valiant man , he took him unto him .
for all these things do the nations of the world seek after : and your father knoweth that ye have need of these things .
but rather seek ye the kingdom of god ; and all these things shall be added unto you .
now the sons of saul were jonathan , and ishui , and melchi - shua : and the names of his two daughters were these ; the name of the firstborn merab , and the name of the younger michal :
that thy trust may be in the lord , i have made known to thee this day , even to thee .
and he gathered an host , and smote the amalekites , and delivered israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them .
for it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee ; they shall withal be fitted in thy lips .
so saul took the kingdom over israel , and fought against all his enemies on every side , against moab , and against the children of ammon , and against edom , and against the kings of zobah , and against the philistines : and whithersoever he turned himself , he vexed them .
let your loins be girded about , and your lights burning ;
then saul went up from following the philistines : and the philistines went to their own place .
fear not , little flock ; for it is your father ' s good pleasure to give you the kingdom .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
sell that ye have , and give alms ; provide yourselves bags which wax not old , a treasure in the heavens that faileth not , where no thief approacheth , neither moth corrupteth .
and saul answered , god do so and more also : for thou shalt surely die , jonathan .
phinehas , the son of eleazar , the son of aaron the priest , hath turned my wrath away from the children of israel , while he was zealous for my sake among them , that i consumed not the children of israel in my jealousy .
and if he shall come in the second watch , or come in the third watch , and find them so , blessed are those servants .
wherefore say , behold , i give unto him my covenant of peace :
the slothful man saith , there is a lion without , i shall be slain in the streets .
and this know , that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come , he would have watched , and not have suffered his house to be broken through .
and he shall have it , and his seed after him , even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood ; because he was zealous for his god , and made an atonement for the children of israel .
the eyes of the lord preserve knowledge , and he overthroweth the words of the transgressor .
and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord , when he will return from the wedding ; that when he cometh and knocketh , they may open unto him immediately .
now the name of the israelite that was slain , even that was slain with the midianitish woman , was zimri , the son of salu , a prince of a chief house among the simeonites .
he that loveth pureness of heart , for the grace of his lips the king shall be his friend .
blessed are those servants , whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching : verily i say unto you , that he shall gird himself , and make them to sit down to meat , and will come forth and serve them .
and the name of the midianitish woman that was slain was cozbi , the daughter of zur ; he was head over a people , and of a chief house in midian .
cast out the scorner , and contention shall go out ; yea , strife and reproach shall cease .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
bow down thine ear , and hear the words of the wise , and apply thine heart unto my knowledge .
vex the midianites , and smite them :
he that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches , and he that giveth to the rich , shall surely come to want .
for they vex you with their wiles , wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of peor , and in the matter of cozbi , the daughter of a prince of midian , their sister , which was slain in the day of the plague for peor ' s sake .
foolishness is bound in the heart of a child ; but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him .
the mouth of strange women is a deep pit : he that is abhorred of the lord shall fall therein .
have not i written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge ,
and saul said , cast lots between me and jonathan my son . and jonathan was taken .
he hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of israel : all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our god .
then saul said to jonathan , tell me what thou hast done . and jonathan told him , and said , i did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand , and , lo , i must die .
make a joyful noise unto the lord , all the earth : make a loud noise , and rejoice , and sing praise .
then said he unto all israel , be ye on one side , and i and jonathan my son will be on the other side . and the people said unto saul , do what seemeth good unto thee .
sing unto the lord with the harp ; with the harp , and the voice of a psalm .
therefore saul said unto the lord god of israel , give a perfect lot . and saul and jonathan were taken : but the people escaped .
with trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the lord , the king .
let the sea roar , and the fulness thereof ; the world , and they that dwell therein .
let the floods clap their hands : let the hills be joyful together
before the lord ; for he cometh to judge the earth : with righteousness shall he judge the world , and the people with equity .
and saul said , draw ye near hither , all the chief of the people : and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day .
and saul asked counsel of god , shall i go down after the philistines ? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of israel ? but he answered him not that day .
but god said unto him , thou fool , this night thy soul shall be required of thee : then whose shall those things be , which thou hast provided ?
for , as the lord liveth , which saveth israel , though it be in jonathan my son , he shall surely die . but there was not a man among all the people that answered him .
so is he that layeth up treasure for himself , and is not rich toward god .
and he said unto his disciples , therefore i say unto you , take no thought for your life , what ye shall eat ; neither for the body , what ye shall put on .
then they told saul , saying , behold , the people sin against the lord , in that they eat with the blood . and he said , ye have transgressed : roll a great stone unto me this day .
the life is more than meat , and the body is more than raiment .
and saul said , let us go down after the philistines by night , and spoil them until the morning light , and let us not leave a man of them . and they said , do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee . then said the priest , let us draw near hither unto god .
consider the ravens : for they neither sow nor reap ; which neither have storehouse nor barn ; and god feedeth them : how much more are ye better than the fowls ?
and saul built an altar unto the lord : the same was the first altar that he built unto the lord .
if ye then be not able to do that thing which is least , why take ye thought for the rest ?
consider the lilies how they grow : they toil not , they spin not ; and yet i say unto you , that solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these .
the prayers of david the son of jesse are ended .
if then god so clothe the grass , which is to day in the field , and to morrow is cast into the oven ; how much more will he clothe you , o ye of little faith ?
and seek not ye what ye shall eat , or what ye shall drink , neither be ye of doubtful mind .
i will heal their backsliding , i will love them freely : for mine anger is turned away from him .
asshur shall not save us ; we will not ride upon horses : neither will we say any more to the work of our hands , ye are our gods : for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy .
take with you words , and turn to the lord : say unto him , take away all iniquity , and receive us graciously : so will we render the calves of our lips .
o israel , return unto the lord thy god ; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity .
and this thing became sin unto the house of jeroboam , even to cut it off , and to destroy it from off the face of the earth .
for the saying which he cried by the word of the lord against the altar in bethel , and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of samaria , shall surely come to pass .
how much more , if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found ? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the philistines ?
and they smote the philistines that day from michmash to aijalon : and the people were very faint .
and the people flew upon the spoil , and took sheep , and oxen , and calves , and slew them on the ground : and the people did eat them with the blood .
who is wise , and he shall understand these things ? prudent , and he shall know them ? for the ways of the lord are right , and the just shall walk in them : but the transgressors shall fall therein .
ephraim shall say , what have i to do any more with idols ? i have heard him , and observed him : i am like a green fir tree . from me is thy fruit found .
they that dwell under his shadow shall return ; they shall revive as the corn , and grow as the vine : the scent thereof shall be as the wine of lebanon .
his branches shall spread , and his beauty shall be as the olive tree , and his smell as lebanon .
i will be as the dew unto israel : he shall grow as the lily , and cast forth his roots as lebanon .
and david took the shields of gold that were on the servants of hadarezer , and brought them to jerusalem .
now when tou king of hamath heard how david had smitten all the host of hadarezer king of zobah ;
and david took from him a thousand chariots , and seven thousand horsemen , and twenty thousand footmen : david also houghed all the chariot horses , but reserved of them an hundred chariots .
and david smote hadarezer king of zobah unto hamath , as he went to stablish his dominion by the river euphrates .
then david put garrisons in syria - damascus ; and the syrians became david ' s servants , and brought gifts . thus the lord preserved david whithersoever he went .
now after this it came to pass , that david smote the philistines , and subdued them , and took gath and her towns out of the hand of the philistines .
the beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness : and the end of his talk is mischievous madness .
a fool also is full of words : a man cannot tell what shall be ; and what shall be after him , who can tell him ?
the labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them , because he knoweth not how to go to the city .
woe to thee , o land , when thy king is a child , and thy princes eat in the morning !
if the iron be blunt , and he do not whet the edge , then must he put to more strength : but wisdom is profitable to direct .
surely the serpent will bite without enchantment ; and a babbler is no better .
the words of a wise man ' s mouth are gracious ; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself .
and i will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of judah , and they shall sell them to the sabeans , to a people far off : for the lord hath spoken it .
behold , i will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold them , and will return your recompence upon your own head :
the children also of judah and the children of jerusalem have ye sold unto the grecians , that ye might remove them far from their border .
because ye have taken my silver and my gold , and have carried into your temples my goodly pleasant things :
proclaim ye this among the gentiles ; prepare war , wake up the mighty men , let all the men of war draw near ; let them come up :
for , behold , in those days , and in that time , when i shall bring again the captivity of judah and jerusalem ,
she that hath borne seven languisheth : she hath given up the ghost ; her sun is gone down while it was yet day : she hath been ashamed and confounded : and the residue of them will i deliver to the sword before their enemies , saith the lord .
i will also gather all nations , and will bring them down into the valley of jehoshaphat , and will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage israel , whom they have scattered among the nations , and parted my land .
their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas : i have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday : i have caused him to fall upon it suddenly , and terrors upon the city .
and they have cast lots for my people ; and have given a boy for an harlot , and sold a girl for wine , that they might drink .
and i will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land ; i will bereave them of children , i will destroy my people , since they return not from their ways .
yea , and what have ye to do with me , o tyre , and zidon , and all the coasts of palestine ? will ye render me a recompence ? and if ye recompence me , swiftly and speedily will i return your recompence upon your own head ;
as the dew of hermon , and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of zion : for there the lord commanded the blessing , even life for evermore .
behold , how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity !
it is like the precious ointment upon the head , that ran down upon the beard , even aaron ' s beard : that went down to the skirts of his garments ;
for who shall have pity upon thee , o jerusalem ? or who shall bemoan thee ? or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest ?
thou hast forsaken me , saith the lord , thou art gone backward : therefore will i stretch out my hand against thee , and destroy thee ; i am weary with repenting .
and i will appoint over them four kinds , saith the lord : the sword to slay , and the dogs to tear , and the fowls of the heaven , and the beasts of the earth , to devour and destroy .
then said the lord unto me , though moses and samuel stood before me , yet my mind could not be toward this people : cast them out of my sight , and let them go forth .
o lord our lord , how excellent is thy name in all the earth ! who hast set thy glory above the heavens .
these things speak , and exhort , and rebuke with all authority . let no man despise thee .
who gave himself for us , that he might redeem us from all iniquity , and purify unto himself a peculiar people , zealous of good works .
looking for that blessed hope , and the glorious appearing of the great god and our saviour jesus christ ;
teaching us that , denying ungodliness and worldly lusts , we should live soberly , righteously , and godly , in this present world ;
for the grace of god that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men ,
thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands ; thou hast put all things under his feet :
not purloining , but shewing all good fidelity ; that they may adorn the doctrine of god our saviour in all things .
all sheep and oxen , yea , and the beasts of the field ;
the fowl of the air , and the fish of the sea , and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas .
o lord our lord , how excellent is thy name in all the earth !
out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies , that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger .
when i consider thy heavens , the work of thy fingers , the moon and the stars , which thou hast ordained ;
what is man , that thou art mindful of him ? and the son of man , that thou visitest him ?
for thou hast made him a little lower than the angels , and hast crowned him with glory and honour .
but the lord is the true god , he is the living god , and an everlasting king : at his wrath the earth shall tremble , and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation .
every man is brutish in his knowledge : every founder is confounded by the graven image : for his molten image is falsehood , and there is no breath in them .
when he uttereth his voice , there is a multitude of waters in the heavens , and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth ; he maketh lightnings with rain , and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures .
he hath made the earth by his power , he hath established the world by his wisdom , and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion .
thus shall ye say unto them , the gods that have not made the heavens and the earth , even they shall perish from the earth , and from under these heavens .
when they go into the tabernacle of the congregation , they shall wash with water , that they die not ; or when they come near to the altar to minister , to burn offering made by fire unto the lord :
moreover the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
and of cassia five hundred shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary , and of oil olive an hin :
take thou also unto thee principal spices , of pure myrrh five hundred shekels , and of sweet cinnamon half so much , even two hundred and fifty shekels , and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels ,
and thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith , and the ark of the testimony ,
and thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment , an ointment compound after the art of the apothecary : it shall be an holy anointing oil .
and the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels , and the laver and his foot .
and the table and all his vessels , and the candlestick and his vessels , and the altar of incense ,
for thus saith the lord , behold , i will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once , and will distress them , that they may find it so .
they are vanity , and the work of errors : in the time of their visitation they shall perish .
and thou shalt sanctify them , that they may be most holy : whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy .
the portion of jacob is not like them : for he is the former of all things ; and israel is the rod of his inheritance : the lord of hosts is his name .
woe is me for my hurt ! my wound is grievous : but i said , truly this is a grief , and i must bear it .
for the pastors are become brutish , and have not sought the lord : therefore they shall not prosper , and all their flocks shall be scattered .
my tabernacle is spoiled , and all my cords are broken : my children are gone forth of me , and they are not : there is none to stretch forth my tent any more , and to set up my curtains .
o lord , i know that the way of man is not in himself : it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps .
behold , the noise of the bruit is come , and a great commotion out of the north country , to make the cities of judah desolate , and a den of dragons .
pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not , and upon the families that call not on thy name : for they have eaten up jacob , and devoured him , and consumed him , and have made his habitation desolate .
o lord , correct me , but with judgment ; not in thine anger , lest thou bring me to nothing .
set the trumpet to thy mouth . he shall come as an eagle against the house of the lord , because they have transgressed my covenant , and trespassed against my law .
israel shall cry unto me , my god , we know thee .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
for they are gone up to assyria , a wild ass alone by himself : ephraim hath hired lovers .
and aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements : once in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations : it is most holy unto the lord .
israel is swallowed up : now shall they be among the gentiles as a vessel wherein is no pleasure .
the rich shall not give more , and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel , when they give an offering unto the lord , to make an atonement for your souls .
then he sheweth them their work , and their transgressions that they have exceeded .
thy calf , o samaria , hath cast thee off ; mine anger is kindled against them : how long will it be ere they attain to innocency ?
every one that passeth among them that are numbered , from twenty years old and above , shall give an offering unto the lord .
and if they be bound in fetters , and be holden in cords of affliction ;
they have set up kings , but not by me : they have made princes , and i knew it not : of their silver and their gold have they made them idols , that they may be cut off .
this they shall give , every one that passeth among them that are numbered , half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary : ( a shekel is twenty gerahs : ) an half shekel shall be the offering of the lord .
he withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous : but with kings are they on the throne ; yea , he doth establish them for ever , and they are exalted .
for they have sown the wind , and they shall reap the whirlwind : it hath no stalk : the bud shall yield no meal : if so be it yield , the strangers shall swallow it up .
when thou takest the sum of the children of israel after their number , then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the lord , when thou numberest them ; that there be no plague among them , when thou numberest them .
he preserveth not the life of the wicked : but giveth right to the poor .
for from israel was it also : the workman made it ; therefore it is not god : but the calf of samaria shall be broken in pieces .
for aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat :
behold , god is mighty , and despiseth not any : he is mighty in strength and wisdom .
thou shalt also make a laver of brass , and his foot also of brass , to wash withal : and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar , and thou shalt put water therein .
for truly my words shall not be false : he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
i will fetch my knowledge from afar , and will ascribe righteousness to my maker .
and thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of israel , and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation ; that it may be a memorial unto the children of israel before the lord , to make an atonement for your souls .
suffer me a little , and i will shew thee that i have yet to speak on god ' s behalf .
elihu also proceeded , and said ,
men , brethren , and fathers , hear ye my defence which i make now unto you .
wherefore shew ye to them , and before the churches , the proof of your love , and of our boasting on your behalf .
and we have sent with them our brother , whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things , but now much more diligent , upon the great confidence which i have in you .
as also the high priest doth bear me witness , and all the estate of the elders : from whom also i received letters unto the brethren , and went to damascus , to bring them which were there bound unto jerusalem , for to be punished .
whether any do inquire of titus , he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you : or our brethren be inquired of , they are the messengers of the churches , and the glory of christ .
and i persecuted this way unto the death , binding and delivering into prisons both men and women .
avoiding this , that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us :
i am verily a man which am a jew , born in tarsus , a city in cilicia , yet brought up in this city at the feet of gamaliel , and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers , and was zealous toward god , as ye all are this day .
providing for honest things , not only in the sight of the lord , but also in the sight of men .
( and when they heard that he spake in the hebrew tongue to them , they kept the more silence : and he saith , )
and when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also , he said unto them , whosoever will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
but when he had turned about and looked on his disciples , he rebuked peter , saying , get thee behind me , satan : for thou savourest not the things that be of god , but the things that be of men .
and he spake that saying openly . and peter took him , and began to rebuke him .
and he began to teach them , that the son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the elders , and of the chief priests , and scribes , and be killed , and after three days rise again .
whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation ; of him also shall the son of man be ashamed , when he cometh in the glory of his father with the holy angels .
or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ?
the proverbs of solomon . a wise son maketh a glad father : but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother .
for what shall it profit a man , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own soul ?
for whosoever will save his life shall lose it ; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel ' s , the same shall save it .
treasures of wickedness profit nothing : but righteousness delivereth from death .
the lord will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish : but he casteth away the substance of the wicked .
he becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand : but the hand of the diligent maketh rich .
to preach the gospel in the regions beyond you , and not to boast in another man ' s line of things made ready to our hand .
but he that glorieth , let him glory in the lord .
the memory of the just is blessed : but the name of the wicked shall rot .
and he charged them that they should tell no man of him .
for not he that commendeth himself is approved , but whom the lord commendeth .
the wise in heart will receive commandments : but a prating fool shall fall .
he that walketh uprightly walketh surely : but he that perverteth his ways shall be known .
for we dare not make ourselves of the number , or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves : but they measuring themselves by themselves , and comparing themselves among themselves , are not wise .
and i answered , who art thou , lord ? and he said unto me , i am jesus of nazareth , whom thou persecutest .
but we will not boast of things without our measure , but according to the measure of the rule which god hath distributed to us , a measure to reach even unto you .
and they that were with me saw indeed the light , and were afraid ; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me .
for we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure , as though we reached not unto you : for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of christ :
and it came to pass , that , as i made my journey , and was come nigh unto damascus about noon , suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me .
not boasting of things without our measure , that is , of other men ' s labours ; but having hope , when your faith is increased , that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly ,
and i fell unto the ground , and heard a voice saying unto me , saul , saul , why persecutest thou me ?
for his letters , say they , are weighty and powerful ; but his bodily presence is weak , and his speech contemptible .
let such an one think this , that , such as we are in word by letters when we are absent , such will we be also in deed when we are present .
and we have sent with him the brother , whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches ;
and he looked up , and said , i see men as trees , walking .
for indeed he accepted the exhortation ; but being more forward , of his own accord he went unto you .
and besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment : and as many as touched were made perfectly whole .
after that he put his hands again upon his eyes , and made him look up : and he was restored , and saw every man clearly .
and he sent him away to his house , saying , neither go into the town , nor tell it to any in the town .
and not that only , but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace , which is administered by us to the glory of the same lord , and declaration of your ready mind :
then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him , saying , of a truth thou art the son of god .
and when they were come into the ship , the wind ceased .
and he said unto them , how is it that ye do not understand ?
and when the men of that place had knowledge of him , they sent out into all that country round about , and brought unto him all that were diseased ;
and he cometh to bethsaida ; and they bring a blind man unto him , and besought him to touch him .
and when they were gone over , they came into the land of gennesaret .
and he took the blind man by the hand , and led him out of the town ; and when he had spit on his eyes , and put his hands upon him , he asked him if he saw ought .
and herein i give my advice : for this is expedient for you , who have begun before , not only to do , but also to be forward a year ago .
now therefore perform the doing of it ; that as there was a readiness to will , so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have .
but by an equality , that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want , that their abundance also may be a supply for your want : that there may be equality :
and they answered , john the baptist : but some say , elias ; and others , one of the prophets .
for i mean not that other men be eased , and ye burdened :
and he saith unto them , but whom say ye that i am ? and peter answereth and saith unto him , thou art the christ .
but thanks be to god , which put the same earnest care into the heart of titus for you .
as it is written , he that had gathered much had nothing over ; and he that had gathered little had no lack .
but when he saw the wind boisterous , he was afraid ; and beginning to sink , he cried , saying , lord , save me .
and immediately jesus stretched forth his hand , and caught him , and said unto him , o thou of little faith , wherefore didst thou doubt ?
and they reasoned among themselves , saying , it is because we have no bread .
and he left them , and entering into the ship again departed to the other side .
now the disciples had forgotten to take bread , neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf .
and the pharisees came forth , and began to question with him , seeking of him a sign from heaven , tempting him .
and he sighed deeply in his spirit , and saith , why doth this generation seek after a sign ? verily i say unto you , there shall no sign be given unto this generation .
and straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples , and came into the parts of dalmanutha .
when i brake the five loaves among five thousand , how many baskets full of fragments took ye up ? they say unto him , twelve .
and when jesus knew it , he saith unto them , why reason ye , because ye have no bread ? perceive ye not yet , neither understand ? have ye your heart yet hardened ?
having eyes , see ye not ? and having ears , hear ye not ? and do ye not remember ?
we love him , because he first loved us .
and his head was brought in a charger , and given to the damsel : and she brought it to her mother .
and he sent , and beheaded john in the prison .
herein is our love made perfect , that we may have boldness in the day of judgment : because as he is , so are we in this world .
when jesus heard of it , he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart : and when the people had heard thereof , they followed him on foot out of the cities .
there is no fear in love ; but perfect love casteth out fear : because fear hath torment . he that feareth is not made perfect in love .
and his disciples came , and took up the body , and buried it , and went and told jesus .
whosoever shall confess that jesus is the son of god , god dwelleth in him , and he in god .
and when it was evening , his disciples came to him , saying , this is a desert place , and the time is now past ; send the multitude away , that they may go into the villages , and buy themselves victuals .
and we have known and believed the love that god hath to us . god is love ; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god , and god in him .
and jesus went forth , and saw a great multitude , and was moved with compassion toward them , and he healed their sick .
hereby know we that we dwell in him , and he in us , because he hath given us of his spirit .
and they say unto him , we have here but five loaves , and two fishes .
and we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to be the saviour of the world .
but jesus said unto them , they need not depart ; give ye them to eat .
he said , bring them hither to me .
and this commandment have we from him , that he who loveth god love his brother also .
if a man say , i love god , and hateth his brother , he is a liar : for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen , how can he love god whom he hath not seen ?
but the ship was now in the midst of the sea , tossed with waves : for the wind was contrary .
and when he had sent the multitudes away , he went up into a mountain apart to pray : and when the evening was come , he was there alone .
and straightway jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship , and to go before him unto the other side , while he sent the multitudes away .
and it shall come to pass in that day , saith the lord god , that i will cause the sun to go down at noon , and i will darken the earth in the clear day :
and they that had eaten were about five thousand men , beside women and children .
and peter answered him and said , lord , if it be thou , bid me come unto thee on the water .
the lord hath sworn by the excellency of jacob , surely i will never forget any of their works .
but straightway jesus spake unto them , saying , be of good cheer ; it is i ; be not afraid .
that we may buy the poor for silver , and the needy for a pair of shoes ; yea , and sell the refuse of the wheat ?
and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea , they were troubled , saying , it is a spirit ; and they cried out for fear .
saying , when will the new moon be gone , that we may sell corn ? and the sabbath , that we may set forth wheat , making the ephah small , and the shekel great , and falsifying the balances by deceit ?
and in the fourth watch of the night jesus went unto them , walking on the sea .
hear this , o ye that swallow up the needy , even to make the poor of the land to fail ,
and the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day , saith the lord god : there shall be many dead bodies in every place ; they shall cast them forth with silence .
and he said , amos , what seest thou ? and i said , a basket of summer fruit . then said the lord unto me , the end is come upon my people of israel ; i will not again pass by them any more .
thus hath the lord god shewed unto me : and behold a basket of summer fruit .
and he said , come . and when peter was come down out of the ship , he walked on the water , to go to jesus .
and i was with thee whithersoever thou wentest , and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight , and have made thee a great name , like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth .
whosoever shall make like unto that , to smell thereto , shall even be cut off from his people .
herein is love , not that we loved god , but that he loved us , and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins .
that the king said unto nathan the prophet , see now , i dwell in an house of cedar , but the ark of god dwelleth within curtains .
and thou shalt beat some of it very small , and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation , where i will meet with thee : it shall be unto you most holy .
and it came to pass , when the king sat in his house , and the lord had given him rest round about from all his enemies ;
and as for the perfume which thou shalt make , ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof : it shall be unto thee holy for the lord .
no man hath seen god at any time . if we love one another , god dwelleth in us , and his love is perfected in us .
and it came to pass that night , that the word of the lord came unto nathan , saying ,
and the lord said unto moses , take unto thee sweet spices , stacte , and onycha , and galbanum ; these sweet spices with pure frankincense : of each shall there be a like weight :
beloved , if god so loved us , we ought also to love one another .
and nathan said to the king , go , do all that is in thine heart ; for the lord is with thee .
and thou shalt make it a perfume , a confection after the art of the apothecary , tempered together , pure and holy :
whereas i have not dwelt in any house since the time that i brought up the children of israel out of egypt , even to this day , but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle .
upon man ' s flesh shall it not be poured , neither shall ye make any other like it , after the composition of it : it is holy , and it shall be holy unto you .
go and tell my servant david , thus saith the lord , shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in ?
whosoever compoundeth any like it , or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger , shall even be cut off from his people .
and they did all eat , and were filled : and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full .
now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant david , thus saith the lord of hosts , i took thee from the sheepcote , from following the sheep , to be ruler over my people , over israel :
and thou shalt anoint aaron and his sons , and consecrate them , that they may minister unto me in the priest ' s office .
in all the places wherein i have walked with all the children of israel spake i a word with any of the tribes of israel , whom i commanded to feed my people israel , saying , why build ye not me an house of cedar ?
and thou shalt speak unto the children of israel , saying , this shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations .
and all flesh died that moved upon the earth , both of fowl , and of cattle , and of beast , and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth , and every man :
all in whose nostrils was the breath of life , of all that was in the dry land , died .
and every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground , both man , and cattle , and the creeping things , and the fowl of the heaven ; and they were destroyed from the earth : and noah only remained alive , and they that were with him in the ark .
and the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days .
only do not two things unto me : then will i not hide myself from thee .
withdraw thine hand far from me : and let not thy dread make me afraid .
then call thou , and i will answer : or let me speak , and answer thou me .
and he , as a rotten thing , consumeth , as a garment that is moth eaten .
thou puttest my feet also in the stocks , and lookest narrowly unto all my paths ; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet .
wherefore hidest thou thy face , and holdest me for thine enemy ?
for thou writest bitter things against me , and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth .
wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro ? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble ?
and it came to pass , while the ark abode in kirjath - jearim , that the time was long ; for it was twenty years : and all the house of israel lamented after the lord .
and the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights .
in the selfsame day entered noah , and shem , and ham , and japheth , the sons of noah , and noah ' s wife , and the three wives of his sons with them , into the ark ;
then the children of israel did put away baalim and ashtaroth , and served the lord only .
and it came to pass after seven days , that the waters of the flood were upon the earth .
and samuel said , gather all israel to mizpeh , and i will pray for you unto the lord .
in the six hundredth year of noah ' s life , in the second month , the seventeenth day of the month , the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up , and the windows of heaven were opened .
and they gathered together to mizpeh , and drew water , and poured it out before the lord , and fasted on that day , and said there , we have sinned against the lord . and samuel judged the children of israel in mizpeh .
and they that went in , went in male and female of all flesh , as god had commanded him : and the lord shut him in .
and when the philistines heard that the children of israel were gathered together to mizpeh , the lords of the philistines went up against israel . and when the children of israel heard it , they were afraid of the philistines .
and the flood was forty days upon the earth ; and the waters increased , and bare up the ark , and it was lift up above the earth .
and the children of israel said to samuel , cease not to cry unto the lord our god for us , that he will save us out of the hand of the philistines .
they , and every beast after his kind , and all the cattle after their kind , and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind , and every fowl after his kind , every bird of every sort .
and samuel took a sucking lamb , and offered it for a burnt offering wholly unto the lord : and samuel cried unto the lord for israel ; and the lord heard him .
and they went in unto noah into the ark , two and two of all flesh , wherein is the breath of life .
he will surely reprove you , if ye do secretly accept persons .
shall not his excellency make you afraid ? and his dread fall upon you ?
and the waters prevailed , and were increased greatly upon the earth ; and the ark went upon the face of the waters .
and the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth ; and all the high hills , that were under the whole heaven , were covered .
who is he that will plead with me ? for now , if i hold my tongue , i shall give up the ghost .
behold now , i have ordered my cause ; i know that i shall be justified .
hear diligently my speech , and my declaration with your ears .
he also shall be my salvation : for an hypocrite shall not come before him .
though he slay me , yet will i trust in him : but i will maintain mine own ways before him .
wherefore do i take my flesh in my teeth , and put my life in mine hand ?
hold your peace , let me alone , that i may speak , and let come on me what will .
your remembrances are like unto ashes , your bodies to bodies of clay .
fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail ; and the mountains were covered .
and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over both the cherethites and the pelethites ; and david ' s sons were chief rulers .
and zadok the son of ahitub , and ahimelech the son of abiathar , were the priests ; and seraiah was the scribe ;
and david reigned over all israel ; and david executed judgment and justice unto all his people .
and he put garrisons in edom ; throughout all edom put he garrisons , and all they of edom became david ' s servants . and the lord preserved david whithersoever he went .
and david gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the syrians in the valley of salt , being eighteen thousand men .
of syria , and of moab , and of the children of ammon , and of the philistines , and of amalek , and of the spoil of hadadezer , son of rehob , king of zobah .
which also king david did dedicate unto the lord , with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued ;
and the jews also assented , saying that these things were so .
commanding his accusers to come unto thee : by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things , whereof we accuse him .
for we have found this man a pestilent fellow , and a mover of sedition among all the jews throughout the world , and a ringleader of the sect of the nazarenes :
notwithstanding , that i be not further tedious unto thee , i pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words .
but the chief captain lysias came upon us , and with great violence took him away out of our hands ,
who also hath gone about to profane the temple : whom we took , and would have judged according to our law .
and after five days ananias the high priest descended with the elders , and with a certain orator named tertullus , who informed the governor against paul .
and when he was called forth , tertullus began to accuse him , saying , seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness , and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence ,
we accept it always , and in all places , most noble felix , with all thankfulness .
and the men of kirjath - jearim came , and fetched up the ark of the lord , and brought it into the house of abinadab in the hill , and sanctified eleazar his son to keep the ark of the lord .
how excellent is thy lovingkindness , o god ! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings .
they shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house ; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures .
for with thee is the fountain of life : in thy light shall we see light .
three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch , a knop and a flower ; and three bowls made like almonds in another branch , a knop and a flower : so throughout the six branches going out of the candlestick .
the transgression of the wicked saith within my heart , that there is no fear of god before his eyes .
for he flattereth himself in his own eyes , until his iniquity be found to be hateful .
and he made the staves of shittim wood , and overlaid them with gold , to bear the table .
the words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit : he hath left off to be wise , and to do good .
and he made the vessels which were upon the table , his dishes , and his spoons , and his bowls , and his covers to cover withal , of pure gold .
he deviseth mischief upon his bed ; he setteth himself in a way that is not good ; he abhorreth not evil .
and he made the candlestick of pure gold : of beaten work made he the candlestick ; his shaft , and his branch , his bowls , his knops , and his flowers , were of the same :
thy mercy , o lord , is in the heavens ; and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds .
and six branches going out of the sides thereof ; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof , and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof :
thy righteousness is like the great mountains ; thy judgments are a great deep : o lord , thou preservest man and beast .
also he made thereunto a border of an handbreadth round about ; and made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about .
and he overlaid it with pure gold , and made thereunto a crown of gold round about .
over against the border were the rings , the places for the staves to bear the table .
and he cast for it four rings of gold , and put the rings upon the four corners that were in the four feet thereof .
and he made the table of shittim wood : two cubits was the length thereof , and a cubit the breadth thereof , and a cubit and a half the height thereof :
as for elkanah : the sons of elkanah ; zophai his son , and nahath his son ,
eliab his son , jeroham his son , elkanah his son .
and the sons of samuel ; the firstborn vashni , and abiah .
and in the candlestick were four bowls made like almonds , his knops , and his flowers :
the sons of merari ; mahli , libni his son , shimei his son , uzza his son ,
and a knop under two branches of the same , and a knop under two branches of the same , and a knop under two branches of the same , according to the six branches going out of it .
and he made his seven lamps , and his snuffers , and his snuffdishes , of pure gold .
of a talent of pure gold made he it , and all the vessels thereof .
and he made the incense altar of shittim wood : the length of it was a cubit , and the breadth of it a cubit ; it was foursquare ; and two cubits was the height of it ; the horns thereof were of the same .
and he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof , by the two corners of it , upon the two sides thereof , to be places for the staves to bear it withal .
and he overlaid it with pure gold , both the top of it , and the sides thereof round about , and the horns of it : also he made unto it a crown of gold round about .
and they ministered before the dwelling place of the tabernacle of the congregation with singing , until solomon had built the house of the lord in jerusalem : and then they waited on their office according to their order .
and he made the holy anointing oil , and the pure incense of sweet spices , according to the work of the apothecary .
and these are they whom david set over the service of song in the house of the lord , after that the ark had rest .
and he made the staves of shittim wood , and overlaid them with gold .
the son of elkanah , the son of jeroham , the son of eliel , the son of toah ,
and these are they that waited with their children . of the sons of the kohathites : heman a singer , the son of joel , the son of shemuel ,
the son of elkanah , the son of joel , the son of azariah , the son of zephaniah ,
the son of zuph , the son of elkanah , the son of mahath , the son of amasai ,
and these be the names of the sons of gershom ; libni , and shimei .
and the sons of kohath were , amram , and izhar , and hebron , and uzziel .
and jehozadak went into captivity , when the lord carried away judah and jerusalem by the hand of nebuchadnezzar .
the sons of levi ; gershom , kohath , and merari .
the sons of merari ; mahli , and mushi . and these are the families of the levites according to their fathers .
joah his son , iddo his son , zerah his son , jeaterai his son .
of gershom ; libni his son , jahath his son , zimmah his son ,
and the sons of elkanah ; amasai , and ahimoth .

elkanah his son , and ebiasaph his son , and assir his son ,
the sons of kohath ; amminadab his son , korah his son , assir his son ,
their brethren also the levites were appointed unto all manner of service of the tabernacle of the house of god .
but aaron and his sons offered upon the altar of the burnt offering , and on the altar of incense , and were appointed for all the work of the place most holy , and to make an atonement for israel , according to all that moses the servant of god had commanded .
but the fields of the city , and the villages thereof , they gave to caleb the son of jephunneh .
and they gave them hebron in the land of judah , and the suburbs thereof round about it .
and hilen with her suburbs , debir with her suburbs ,
and to the sons of aaron they gave the cities of judah , namely , hebron , the city of refuge , and libnah with her suburbs , and jattir , and eshtemoa , with their suburbs ,
meraioth his son , amariah his son , ahitub his son ,
bukki his son , uzzi his son , zerahiah his son ,

zadok his son , ahimaaz his son .
and these are the sons of aaron ; eleazar his son , phinehas his son , abishua his son ,

and their brethren the sons of merari stood on the left hand : ethan the son of kishi , the son of abdi , the son of malluch ,
the son of jahath , the son of gershom , the son of levi .
he hath dispersed , he hath given to the poor ; his righteousness endureth for ever ; his horn shall be exalted with honour .
the son of ethan , the son of zimmah , the son of shimei ,
his heart is established , he shall not be afraid , until he see his desire upon his enemies .
the son of ethni , the son of zerah , the son of adaiah ,
the son of michael , the son of baaseiah , the son of malchiah ,
wealth and riches shall be in his house : and his righteousness endureth for ever .

praise ye the lord . blessed is the man that feareth the lord , that delighteth greatly in his commandments .
he shall not be afraid of evil tidings : his heart is fixed , trusting in the lord .
surely he shall not be moved for ever : the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance .
a good man sheweth favour , and lendeth : he will guide his affairs with discretion .
unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness : he is gracious , and full of compassion , and righteous .
whilst their children remember their altars and their groves by the green trees upon the high hills .
the sin of judah is written with a pen of iron , and with the point of a diamond : it is graven upon the table of their heart , and upon the horns of your altars ;
o my mountain in the field , i will give thy substance and all thy treasures to the spoil , and thy high places for sin , throughout all thy borders .
for he shall be like the heath in the desert , and shall not see when good cometh ; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness , in a salt land and not inhabited .
blessed is the man that trusteth in the lord , and whose hope the lord is .
for he shall be as a tree planted by the waters , and that spreadeth out her roots by the river , and shall not see when heat cometh , but her leaf shall be green ; and shall not be careful in the year of drought , neither shall cease from yielding fruit .
the heart is deceitful above all things , and desperately wicked : who can know it ?
a fire goeth before him , and burneth up his enemies round about .
clouds and darkness are round about him : righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne .
the lord reigneth ; let the earth rejoice ; let the multitude of isles be glad thereof .
and david abode in the wilderness in strong holds , and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of ziph . and saul sought him every day , but god delivered him not into his hand .
then david and his men , which were about six hundred , arose and departed out of keilah , and went whithersoever they could go . and it was told saul that david was escaped from keilah ; and he forbare to go forth .
and jonathan saul ' s son arose , and went to david into the wood , and strengthened his hand in god .
and david saw that saul was come out to seek his life : and david was in the wilderness of ziph in a wood .
then said david , will the men of keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of saul ? and the lord said , they will deliver thee up .
will the men of keilah deliver me up into his hand ? will saul come down , as thy servant hath heard ? o lord god of israel , i beseech thee , tell thy servant . and the lord said , he will come down .
and they two made a covenant before the lord : and david abode in the wood , and jonathan went to his house .
and he said unto him , fear not : for the hand of saul my father shall not find thee ; and thou shalt be king over israel , and i shall be next unto thee ; and that also saul my father knoweth .
then came up the ziphites to saul to gibeah , saying , doth not david hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood , in the hill of hachilah , which is on the south of jeshimon ?
zion heard , and was glad ; and the daughters of judah rejoiced because of thy judgments , o lord .
for thou , lord , art high above all the earth : thou art exalted far above all gods .
the hills melted like wax at the presence of the lord , at the presence of the lord of the whole earth .
the heavens declare his righteousness , and all the people see his glory .
confounded be all they that serve graven images , that boast themselves of idols : worship him , all ye gods .
and azariah begat amariah , and amariah begat ahitub ,
and ahitub begat zadok , and zadok begat shallum ,
and shallum begat hilkiah , and hilkiah begat azariah ,
and azariah begat seraiah , and seraiah begat jehozadak ,
and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord , according to all that david his father had done .
he in the first year of his reign , in the first month , opened the doors of the house of the lord , and repaired them .
hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old , and he reigned nine and twenty years in jerusalem . and his mother ' s name was abijah , the daughter of zechariah .
wherefore saul returned from pursuing after david , and went against the philistines : therefore they called that place sela - hammahlekoth .
and david went up from thence , and dwelt in strong holds at en - gedi .
and they arose , and went to ziph before saul : but david and his men were in the wilderness of maon , in the plain on the south of jeshimon .
saul also and his men went to seek him . and they told david : wherefore he came down into a rock , and abode in the wilderness of maon . and when saul heard that , he pursued after david in the wilderness of maon .
for , lo , our fathers have fallen by the sword , and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this .
and saul went on this side of the mountain , and david and his men on that side of the mountain : and david made haste to get away for fear of saul ; for saul and his men compassed david and his men round about to take them .
wherefore the wrath of the lord was upon judah and jerusalem , and he hath delivered them to trouble , to astonishment , and to hissing , as ye see with your eyes .
but there came a messenger unto saul , saying , haste thee , and come ; for the philistines have invaded the land .
also they have shut up the doors of the porch , and put out the lamps , and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place unto the god of israel .
now therefore , o king , come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down ; and our part shall be to deliver him into the king ' s hand .
for our fathers have trespassed , and done that which was evil in the eyes of the lord our god , and have forsaken him , and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the lord , and turned their backs .
and saul said , blessed be ye of the lord ; for ye have compassion on me .
and said unto them , hear me , ye levites , sanctify now yourselves , and sanctify the house of the lord god of your fathers , and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place .
and he brought in the priests and the levites , and gathered them together into the east street ,
see therefore , and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself , and come ye again to me with the certainty , and i will go with you : and it shall come to pass , if he be in the land , that i will search him out throughout all the thousands of judah .
thou hast seen it ; for thou beholdest mischief and spite , to requite it with thy hand : the poor committeth himself unto thee ; thou art the helper of the fatherless .
break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man : seek out his wickedness till thou find none .
for the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder , which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard .
arise , o lord ; o god , lift up thine hand : forget not the humble .
wherefore doth the wicked contemn god ? he hath said in his heart , thou wilt not require it .
he croucheth , and humbleth himself , that the poor may fall by his strong ones .
and said unto them ; go ye also into the vineyard , and whatsoever is right i will give you . and they went their way .
he hath said in his heart , god hath forgotten : he hideth his face ; he will never see it .
again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour , and did likewise .
and when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day , he sent them into his vineyard .
and he went out about the third hour , and saw others standing idle in the marketplace ,
to judge the fatherless and the oppressed , that the man of the earth may no more oppress .
the lord is king for ever and ever : the heathen are perished out of his land .
lord , thou hast heard the desire of the humble : thou wilt prepare their heart , thou wilt cause thine ear to hear :
and that doeth not any of those duties , but even hath eaten upon the mountains , and defiled his neighbour ' s wife ,
if he beget a son that is a robber , a shedder of blood , and that doeth the like to any one of these things ,
hath given forth upon usury , and hath taken increase : shall he then live ? he shall not live : he hath done all these abominations ; he shall surely die ; his blood shall be upon him .
hath oppressed the poor and needy , hath spoiled by violence , hath not restored the pledge , and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols , hath committed abomination ,
lift up your hands in the sanctuary , and bless the lord .
the lord that made heaven and earth bless thee out of zion .
behold , bless ye the lord , all ye servants of the lord , which by night stand in the house of the lord .
and out of the tribe of benjamin ; geba with her suburbs , and alemeth with her suburbs , and anathoth with her suburbs . all their cities throughout their families were thirteen cities .
and unto the sons of kohath , which were left of the family of that tribe , were cities given out of the half tribe , namely , out of the half tribe of manasseh , by lot , ten cities .
and the residue of the families of the sons of kohath had cities of their coasts out of the tribe of ephraim .
when a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness , and committeth iniquity , and dieth in them ; for his iniquity that he hath done shall he die .
and they gave unto them , of the cities of refuge , shechem in mount ephraim with her suburbs ; they gave also gezer with her suburbs ,
yet ye say , the way of the lord is not equal . hear now , o house of israel ; is not my way equal ? are not your ways unequal ?
and jokmeam with her suburbs , and beth - horon with her suburbs ,
because he considereth , and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
and aijalon with her suburbs , and gath - rimmon with her suburbs :
again , when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed , and doeth that which is lawful and right , he shall save his soul alive .
lest he tear my soul like a lion , rending it in pieces , while there is none to deliver .
unto the sons of merari were given by lot , throughout their families , out of the tribe of reuben , and out of the tribe of gad , and out of the tribe of zebulun , twelve cities .
o lord my god , in thee do i put my trust : save me from all them that persecute me , and deliver me :
yet saith the house of israel , the way of the lord is not equal . o house of israel , are not my ways equal ? are not your ways unequal ?
and the children of israel gave to the levites these cities with their suburbs .
and they gave by lot out of the tribe of the children of judah , and out of the tribe of the children of simeon , and out of the tribe of the children of benjamin , these cities , which are called by their names .
therefore i will judge you , o house of israel , every one according to his ways , saith the lord god . repent , and turn yourselves from all your transgressions ; so iniquity shall not be your ruin .
cast away from you all your transgressions , whereby ye have transgressed ; and make you a new heart and a new spirit : for why will ye die , o house of israel ?
that thou givest them they gather : thou openest thine hand , they are filled with good .
for i have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth , saith the lord god : wherefore turn yourselves , and live ye .
and ashan with her suburbs , and beth - shemesh with her suburbs :
these wait all upon thee ; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season .
there go the ships : there is that leviathan , whom thou hast made to play therein .
so is this great and wide sea , wherein are things creeping innumerable , both small and great beasts .
o lord , how manifold are thy works ! in wisdom hast thou made them all : the earth is full of thy riches .
man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening .
the sun ariseth , they gather themselves together , and lay them down in their dens .
thou makest darkness , and it is night : wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth .
unto the sons of gershom were given out of the family of the half tribe of manasseh , golan in bashan with her suburbs , and ashtaroth with her suburbs :
and out of the tribe of issachar ; kedesh with her suburbs , daberath with her suburbs ,
for he saith to the snow , be thou on the earth ; likewise to the small rain , and to the great rain of his strength .
he sealeth up the hand of every man ; that all men may know his work .
and out of the half tribe of manasseh ; aner with her suburbs , and bileam with her suburbs , for the family of the remnant of the sons of kohath .
then the beasts go into dens , and remain in their places .
out of the south cometh the whirlwind : and cold out of the north .
that hath taken off his hand from the poor , that hath not received usury nor increase , hath executed my judgments , hath walked in my statutes ; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father , he shall surely live .
neither hath oppressed any , hath not withholden the pledge , neither hath spoiled by violence , but hath given his bread to the hungry , and hath covered the naked with a garment ,
unto the rest of the children of merari were given out of the tribe of zebulun . rimmon with her suburbs , tabor with her suburbs :
that hath not eaten upon the mountains , neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of israel , hath not defiled his neighbour ' s wife ,
and on the other side jordan by jericho , on the east side of jordan , were given them out of the tribe of reuben , bezer in the wilderness with her suburbs , and jahzah with her suburbs ,
now , lo , if he beget a son , that seeth all his father ' s sins which he hath done , and considereth , and doeth not such like ,
and hukok with her suburbs , and rehob with her suburbs :
at this also my heart trembleth , and is moved out of his place .
and out of the tribe of naphtali ; kedesh in galilee with her suburbs , and hammon with her suburbs , and kirjathaim with her suburbs .
hear attentively the noise of his voice , and the sound that goeth out of his mouth .
and ramoth with her suburbs , and anem with her suburbs :
he directeth it under the whole heaven , and his lightning unto the ends of the earth .
yet say ye , why ? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father ? when the son hath done that which is lawful and right , and hath kept all my statutes , and hath done them , he shall surely live .
and out of the tribe of asher ; mashal with her suburbs , and abdon with her suburbs ,
after it a voice roareth : he thundereth with the voice of his excellency ; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard .
as for his father , because he cruelly oppressed , spoiled his brother by violence , and did that which is not good among his people , lo , even he shall die in his iniquity .
o lord my god , if i have done this ; if there be iniquity in my hands ;
he appointed the moon for seasons : the sun knoweth his going down .
if i have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me ; ( yea , i have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy : )
the soul that sinneth , it shall die . the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father , neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son : the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him , and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him .
let the enemy persecute my soul , and take it ; yea , let him tread down my life upon the earth , and lay mine honour in the dust . selah .
arise , o lord , in thine anger , lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies : and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded .
so shall the congregation of the people compass thee about : for their sakes therefore return thou on high .
and wine that maketh glad the heart of man , and oil to make his face to shine , and bread which strengtheneth man ' s heart .
have i any pleasure at all that the wicked should die ? saith the lord god : and not that he should return from his ways , and live ?
the lord shall judge the people : judge me , o lord , according to my righteousness , and according to mine integrity that is in me .
oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end ; but establish the just : for the righteous god trieth the hearts and reins .
where the birds make their nests : as for the stork , the fir trees are her house .
but if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed , and keep all my statutes , and do that which is lawful and right , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
the trees of the lord are full of sap ; the cedars of lebanon , which he hath planted ;
all his transgressions that he hath committed , they shall not be mentioned unto him : in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live .
they give drink to every beast of the field : the wild asses quench their thirst .
he sendeth the springs into the valleys , which run among the hills .
he watereth the hills from his chambers : the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works .
by them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation , which sing among the branches .
and out of the tribe of gad ; ramoth in gilead with her suburbs , and mahanaim with her suburbs ,
and about the eleventh hour he went out , and found others standing idle , and saith unto them , why stand ye here all the day idle ?
and heshbon with her suburbs , and jazer with her suburbs .
they say unto him , because no man hath hired us . he saith unto them , go ye also into the vineyard ; and whatsoever is right , that shall ye receive .
so when even was come , the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward , call the labourers , and give them their hire , beginning from the last unto the first .
and when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour , they received every man a penny .
and he that killeth a beast , he shall restore it : and he that killeth a man , he shall be put to death .
ye shall have one manner of law , as well for the stranger , as for one of your own country : for i am the lord your god .
and moses spake to the children of israel , that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp , and stone him with stones . and the children of israel did as the lord commanded moses .
neither shall one thrust another ; they shall walk every one in his path : and when they fall upon the sword , they shall not be wounded .
they shall run to and fro in the city ; they shall run upon the wall , they shall climb up upon the houses ; they shall enter in at the windows like a thief .
before their face the people shall be much pained : all faces shall gather blackness .
they shall run like mighty men ; they shall climb the wall like men of war ; and they shall march every one on his ways , and they shall not break their ranks :
a fire devoureth before them ; and behind them a flame burneth : the land is as the garden of eden before them , and behind them a desolate wilderness ; yea , and nothing shall escape them .
a day of darkness and of gloominess , a day of clouds and of thick darkness , as the morning spread upon the mountains : a great people and a strong ; there hath not been ever the like , neither shall be any more after it , even to the years of many generations .
like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap , like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble , as a strong people set in battle array .
the appearance of them is as the appearance of horses ; and as horsemen , so shall they run .
blow ye the trumpet in zion , and sound an alarm in my holy mountain : let all the inhabitants of the land tremble : for the day of the lord cometh , for it is nigh at hand ;
and the son of an israelitish woman , whose father was an egyptian , went out among the children of israel : and this son of the israelitish woman and a man of israel strove together in the camp ;
and the israelitish woman ' s son blasphemed the name of the lord , and cursed . and they brought him unto moses : ( and his mother ' s name was shelomith , the daughter of dibri , of the tribe of dan : )
and if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour ; as he hath done , so shall it be done to him ;
and he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death .
and he that blasphemeth the name of the lord , he shall surely be put to death , and all the congregation shall certainly stone him : as well the stranger , as he that is born in the land , when he blasphemeth the name of the lord , shall be put to death .
and thou shalt speak unto the children of israel , saying , whosoever curseth his god shall bear his sin .
bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp ; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head , and let all the congregation stone him .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
and they put him in ward , that the mind of the lord might be shewed them .
the glory of the lord shall endure for ever : the lord shall rejoice in his works .
thou sendest forth thy spirit , they are created : and thou renewest the face of the earth .
he looketh on the earth , and it trembleth : he toucheth the hills , and they smoke .
let the sinners be consumed out of the earth , and let the wicked be no more . bless thou the lord , o my soul . praise ye the lord .
my meditation of him shall be sweet : i will be glad in the lord .
and nebuzar - adan captain of the guard took these , and brought them to the king of babylon to riblah :
the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits , and the chapiter upon it was brass : and the height of the chapiter three cubits ; and the wreathen work , and pomegranates upon the chapiter round about , all of brass : and like unto these had the second pillar with wreathen work .
the two pillars , one sea , and the bases which solomon had made for the house of the lord ; the brass of all these vessels was without weight .
and the firepans , and the bowls , and such things as were of gold , in gold , and of silver , in silver , the captain of the guard took away .
and the pots , and the shovels , and the snuffers , and the spoons , and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered , took they away .
and the pillars of brass that were in the house of the lord , and the bases , and the brasen sea that was in the house of the lord , did the chaldees break in pieces , and carried the brass of them to babylon .
but the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen .
now the rest of the people that were left in the city , and the fugitives that fell away to the king of babylon , with the remnant of the multitude , did nebuzar - adan the captain of the guard carry away .
and all the army of the chaldees , that were with the captain of the guard , brake down the walls of jerusalem round about .
as thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of israel , because it was desolate , so will i do unto thee : thou shalt be desolate , o mount seir , and all idumea , even all of it : and they shall know that i am the lord .
thus saith the lord god ; when the whole earth rejoiceth , i will make thee desolate .
and thou shalt know that i am the lord , and that i have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of israel , saying , they are laid desolate , they are given us to consume .
therefore , as i live , saith the lord god , i will even do according to thine anger , and according to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy hatred against them ; and i will make myself known among them , when i have judged thee .
because thou hast said , these two nations and these two countries shall be mine , and we will possess it ; whereas the lord was there :
and the captain of the guard took seraiah the chief priest , and zephaniah the second priest , and the three keepers of the door :
it is he that buildeth his stories in the heaven , and hath founded his troop in the earth ; he that calleth for the waters of the sea , and poureth them out upon the face of the earth : the lord is his name .
are ye not as children of the ethiopians unto me , o children of israel ? saith the lord . have not i brought up israel out of the land of egypt ? and the philistines from caphtor , and the syrians from kir ?
behold , the lord hath proclaimed unto the end of the world , say ye to the daughter of zion , behold , thy salvation cometh ; behold , his reward is with him , and his work before him .
and though they go into captivity before their enemies , thence will i command the sword , and it shall slay them : and i will set mine eyes upon them for evil , and not for good .
go through , go through the gates ; prepare ye the way of the people ; cast up , cast up the highway ; gather out the stones ; lift up a standard for the people .
and the lord god of hosts is he that toucheth the land , and it shall melt , and all that dwell therein shall mourn : and it shall rise up wholly like a flood ; and shall be drowned , as by the flood of egypt .
behold , the eyes of the lord god are upon the sinful kingdom , and i will destroy it from off the face of the earth ; saving that i will not utterly destroy the house of jacob , saith the lord .
for , lo , i will command , and i will sift the house of israel among all nations , like as corn is sifted in a sieve , yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth .
and his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the king , a daily rate for every day , all the days of his life .
though they dig into hell , thence shall mine hand take them ; though they climb up to heaven , thence will i bring them down :
and though they hide themselves in the top of carmel , i will search and take them out thence ; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea , thence will i command the serpent , and he shall bite them :
and all the people , both small and great , and the captains of the armies , arose , and came to egypt : for they were afraid of the chaldees .
but it came to pass in the seventh month , that ishmael the son of nethaniah , the son of elishama , of the seed royal , came , and ten men with him , and smote gedaliah , that he died , and the jews and the chaldees that were with him at mizpah .
and he spake kindly to him , and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in babylon ;
and as for the people that remained in the land of judah , whom nebuchadnezzar king of babylon had left , even over them he made gedaliah the son of ahikam , the son of shaphan , ruler .
an hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour : but through knowledge shall the just be delivered .
and gedaliah sware to them , and to their men , and said unto them , fear not to be the servants of the chaldees : dwell in the land , and serve the king of babylon ; and it shall be well with you .
the righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way : but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness .
the righteousness of the upright shall deliver them : but transgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness .
when a wicked man dieth , his expectation shall perish : and the hope of unjust men perisheth .
the righteous is delivered out of trouble , and the wicked cometh in his stead .
a false balance is abomination to the lord : but a just weight is his delight .
and they shall call them , the holy people , the redeemed of the lord : and thou shalt be called , sought out , a city not forsaken .
and changed his prison garments : and he did eat bread continually before him all the days of his life .
when pride cometh , then cometh shame : but with the lowly is wisdom .
the integrity of the upright shall guide them : but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them .
riches profit not in the day of wrath : but righteousness delivereth from death .
and it came to pass the same night , that the word of god came to nathan , saying ,
then nathan said unto david , do all that is in thine heart ; for god is with thee .
now it came to pass , as david sat in his house , that david said to nathan the prophet , lo , i dwell in an house of cedars , but the ark of the covenant of the lord remaineth under curtains .
who is she that looketh forth as the morning , fair as the moon , clear as the sun , and terrible as an army with banners ?
wheresoever i have walked with all israel , spake i a word to any of the judges of israel , whom i commanded to feed my people , saying , why have ye not built me an house of cedars ?
go and tell david my servant , thus saith the lord , thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in :
for i have not dwelt in an house since the day that i brought up israel unto this day ; but have gone from tent to tent , and from one tabernacle to another .
and i have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked , and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee , and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth .
also i will ordain a place for my people israel , and will plant them , and they shall dwell in their place , and shall be moved no more ; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more , as at the beginning ,
or ever i was aware , my soul made me like the chariots of amminadib .
i went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley , and to see whether the vine flourished , and the pomegranates budded .
the floor and the winepress shall not feed them , and the new wine shall fail in her .
return , return , o shulamite ; return , return , that we may look upon thee . what will ye see in the shulamite ? as it were the company of two armies .
rejoice not , o israel , for joy , as other people : for thou hast gone a whoring from thy god , thou hast loved a reward upon every cornfloor .
they shall not dwell in the lord ' s land ; but ephraim shall return to egypt , and they shall eat unclean things in assyria .
they shall not offer wine offerings to the lord , neither shall they be pleasing unto him : their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners ; all that eat thereof shall be polluted : for their bread for their soul shall not come into the house of the lord .
what will ye do in the solemn day , and in the day of the feast of the lord ?
for , lo , they are gone because of destruction : egypt shall gather them up , memphis shall bury them : the pleasant places for their silver , nettles shall possess them : thorns shall be in their tabernacles .
the days of visitation are come , the days of recompence are come ; israel shall know it : the prophet is a fool , the spiritual man is mad , for the multitude of thine iniquity , and the great hatred .
and jacob went out from beer - sheba , and went toward haran .
the watchman of ephraim was with my god : but the prophet is a snare of a fowler in all his ways , and hatred in the house of his god .
they have deeply corrupted themselves , as in the days of gibeah : therefore he will remember their iniquity , he will visit their sins .
and he dreamed , and behold a ladder set up on the earth , and the top of it reached to heaven : and behold the angels of god ascending and descending on it .
and when the syrians of damascus came to succour hadadezer king of zobah , david slew of the syrians two and twenty thousand men .
and david took from him a thousand chariots , and seven hundred horsemen , and twenty thousand footmen : and david houghed all the chariot horses , but reserved of them for an hundred chariots .
and david took the shields of gold that were on the servants of hadadezer , and brought them to jerusalem .
then david put garrisons in syria of damascus : and the syrians became servants to david , and brought gifts . and the lord preserved david whithersoever he went .
and after this it came to pass , that david smote the philistines , and subdued them : and david took metheg - ammah out of the hand of the philistines .
david smote also hadadezer , the son of rehob , king of zobah , as he went to recover his border at the river euphrates .
and he smote moab , and measured them with a line , casting them down to the ground ; even with two lines measured he to put to death , and with one full line to keep alive . and so the moabites became david ' s servants , and brought gifts .
when toi king of hamath heard that david had smitten all the host of hadadezer ,
and from betah , and from berothai , cities of hadadezer , king david took exceeding much brass .
of the sons of pahath - moab ; elihoenai the son of zerahiah , and with him two hundred males .
of the sons of shechaniah , of the sons of pharosh ; zechariah : and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an hundred and fifty .
of the sons of shechaniah ; the son of jahaziel , and with him three hundred males .
and of the sons of elam ; jeshaiah the son of athaliah , and with him seventy males .
of the sons of joab ; obadiah the son of jehiel , and with him two hundred and eighteen males .
now when solomon had made an end of praying , the fire came down from heaven , and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices ; and the glory of the lord filled the house .
these are now the chief of their fathers , and this is the genealogy of them that went up with me from babylon , in the reign of artaxerxes the king .
and when all the children of israel saw how the fire came down , and the glory of the lord upon the house , they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement , and worshipped , and praised the lord , saying , for he is good ; for his mercy endureth for ever .
of the sons of phinehas ; gershom : of the sons of ithamar ; daniel : of the sons of david ; hattush .
and the priests could not enter into the house of the lord , because the glory of the lord had filled the lord ' s house .
and king solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen , and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep : so the king and all the people dedicated the house of god .
then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the lord .
moreover solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the lord : for there he offered burnt offerings , and the fat of the peace offerings , because the brasen altar which solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings , and the meat offerings , and the fat .
and the priests waited on their offices : the levites also with instruments of musick of the lord , which david the king had made to praise the lord , because his mercy endureth for ever , when david praised by their ministry ; and the priests sounded trumpets before them , and all israel stood .
and in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly : for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days , and the feast seven days .
also at the same time solomon kept the feast seven days , and all israel with him , a very great congregation , from the entering in of hamath unto the river of egypt .
and let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of vashti . and the thing pleased the king ; and he did so .
who had been carried away from jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with jeconiah king of judah , whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon had carried away .
and he brought up hadassah , that is , esther , his uncle ' s daughter : for she had neither father nor mother , and the maid was fair and beautiful ; whom mordecai , when her father and mother were dead , took for his own daughter .
after these things , when the wrath of king ahasuerus was appeased , he remembered vashti , and what she had done , and what was decreed against her .
let both grow together until the harvest : and in the time of harvest i will say to the reapers , gather ye together first the tares , and bind them in bundles to burn them : but gather the wheat into my barn .
then said the king ' s servants that ministered unto him , let there be fair young virgins sought for the king :
so it came to pass , when the king ' s commandment and his decree was heard , and when many maidens were gathered together unto shushan the palace , to the custody of hegai , that esther was brought also unto the king ' s house , to the custody of hegai , keeper of the women .
the enemy that sowed them is the devil ; the harvest is the end of the world ; and the reapers are the angels .
for if the ministration of condemnation be glory , much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory .
how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious ?
but if the ministration of death , written and engraven in stones , was glorious , so that the children of israel could not stedfastly behold the face of moses for the glory of his countenance ; which glory was to be done away :
all these things spake jesus unto the multitude in parables ; and without a parable spake he not unto them :
another parable spake he unto them ; the kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven , which a woman took , and hid in three measures of meal , till the whole was leavened .
which indeed is the least of all seeds : but when it is grown , it is the greatest among herbs , and becometh a tree , so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof .
another parable put he forth unto them , saying , the kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed , which a man took , and sowed in his field :
the field is the world ; the good seed are the children of the kingdom ; but the tares are the children of the wicked one ;
he answered and said unto them , he that soweth the good seed is the son of man ;
forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of christ ministered by us , written not with ink , but with the spirit of the living god ; not in tables of stone , but in fleshy tables of the heart .
and such trust have we through christ to god - ward :
not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves ; but our sufficiency is of god ;
who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament ; not of the letter , but of the spirit : for the letter killeth , but the spirit giveth life .
do we begin again to commend ourselves ? or need we , as some others , epistles of commendation to you , or letters of commendation from you ?
ye are our epistle written in our hearts , known and read of all men :
but he said , nay ; lest while ye gather up the tares , ye root up also the wheat with them .
he said unto them , an enemy hath done this . the servants said unto him , wilt thou then that we go and gather them up ?
yet hath he not root in himself , but dureth for a while : for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word , by and by he is offended .
but he that received the seed into stony places , the same is he that heareth the word , and anon with joy receiveth it ;
but he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word , and understandeth it ; which also beareth fruit , and bringeth forth , some an hundredfold , some sixty , some thirty .
he also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word ; and the care of this world , and the deceitfulness of riches , choke the word , and he becometh unfruitful .
but while men slept , his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat , and went his way .
another parable put he forth unto them , saying , the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field :
so the servants of the householder came and said unto him , sir , didst not thou sow good seed in thy field ? from whence then hath it tares ?
but when the blade was sprung up , and brought forth fruit , then appeared the tares also .
he is the tower of salvation for his king : and sheweth mercy to his anointed , unto david , and to his seed for evermore .
when any one heareth the word of the kingdom , and understandeth it not , then cometh the wicked one , and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart . this is he which received seed by the way side .
hear ye therefore the parable of the sower .
therefore i will give thanks unto thee , o lord , among the heathen , and i will sing praises unto thy name .
for verily i say unto you , that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see , and have not seen them ; and to hear those things which ye hear , and have not heard them .
but blessed are your eyes , for they see : and your ears , for they hear .
for this people ' s heart is waxed gross , and their ears are dull of hearing , and their eyes they have closed ; lest at any time they should see with their eyes , and hear with their ears , and should understand with their heart , and should be converted , and i should heal them .
and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of esaias , which saith , by hearing ye shall hear , and shall not understand ; and seeing ye shall see , and shall not perceive :
therefore speak i to them in parables : because they seeing see not ; and hearing they hear not , neither do they understand .
for whosoever hath , to him shall be given , and he shall have more abundance : but whosoever hath not , from him shall be taken away even that he hath .
he answered and said unto them , because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven , but to them it is not given .
and the disciples came , and said unto him , why speakest thou unto them in parables ?
and it came to pass , when men began to multiply on the face of the earth , and daughters were born unto them ,
as soon as the morning was light , the men were sent away , they and their asses .
and put my cup , the silver cup , in the sack ' s mouth of the youngest , and his corn money . and he did according to the word that joseph had spoken .
and he commanded the steward of his house , saying , fill the men ' s sacks with food , as much as they can carry , and put every man ' s money in his sack ' s mouth .
and he overtook them , and he spake unto them these same words .
and they said unto him , wherefore saith my lord these words ? god forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing :
and when they were gone out of the city , and not yet far off , joseph said unto his steward , up , follow after the men ; and when thou dost overtake them , say unto them , wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good ?
is not this it in which my lord drinketh , and whereby indeed he divineth ? ye have done evil in so doing .
behold , the money , which we found in our sacks ' mouths , we brought again unto thee out of the land of canaan : how then should we steal out of thy lord ' s house silver or gold ?
with whomsoever of thy servants it be found , both let him die , and we also will be my lord ' s bondmen .
and the lord said , i will destroy man whom i have created from the face of the earth ; both man , and beast , and the creeping thing , and the fowls of the air ; for it repenteth me that i have made them .
and it repented the lord that he had made man on the earth , and it grieved him at his heart .
these are the generations of noah : noah was a just man and perfect in his generations , and noah walked with god .
but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord .
and the lord said , my spirit shall not always strive with man , for that he also is flesh : yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years .
that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair ; and they took them wives of all which they chose .
and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth , and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually .
there were giants in the earth in those days ; and also after that , when the sons of god came in unto the daughters of men , and they bare children to them , the same became mighty men which were of old , men of renown .
correct thy son , and he shall give thee rest ; yea , he shall give delight unto thy soul .
where there is no vision , the people perish : but he that keepeth the law , happy is he .
a servant will not be corrected by words : for though he understand he will not answer .
but she is happier if she so abide , after my judgment : and i think also that i have the spirit of god .
he teacheth my hands to war ; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms .
thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation : and thy gentleness hath made me great .
god is my strength and power : and he maketh my way perfect .
he maketh my feet like hinds ' feet : and setteth me upon my high places .
as for god , his way is perfect ; the word of the lord is tried : he is a buckler to all them that trust in him .
draw me not away with the wicked , and with the workers of iniquity , which speak peace to their neighbours , but mischief is in their hearts .
for who is god , save the lord ? and who is a rock , save our god ?
hear the voice of my supplications , when i cry unto thee , when i lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle .
unto thee will i cry , o lord my rock ; be not silent to me : lest , if thou be silent to me , i become like them that go down into the pit .
for by thee i have run through a troop : by my god have i leaped over a wall .
the lord is my strength and my shield ; my heart trusted in him , and i am helped : therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth ; and with my song will i praise him .
he that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become his son at the length .
blessed be the lord , because he hath heard the voice of my supplications .
seest thou a man that is hasty in his words ? there is more hope of a fool than of him .
because they regard not the works of the lord , nor the operation of his hands , he shall destroy them , and not build them up .
a man ' s pride shall bring him low : but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit .
give them according to their deeds , and according to the wickedness of their endeavours : give them after the work of their hands ; render to them their desert .
an angry man stirreth up strife , and a furious man aboundeth in transgression .
and i have consumed them , and wounded them , that they could not arise : yea , they are fallen under my feet .
the fear of man bringeth a snare : but whoso putteth his trust in the lord shall be safe .
whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul : he heareth cursing , and bewrayeth it not .
thou hast enlarged my steps under me ; so that my feet did not slip .
save thy people , and bless thine inheritance : feed them also , and lift them up for ever .
an unjust man is an abomination to the just : and he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked .
i have pursued mine enemies , and destroyed them ; and turned not again until i had consumed them .
the lord is their strength , and he is the saving strength of his anointed .
many seek the ruler ' s favour ; but every man ' s judgment cometh from the lord .
thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people , thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen : a people which i knew not shall serve me .
strangers shall submit themselves unto me : as soon as they hear , they shall be obedient unto me .
the lord liveth ; and blessed be my rock ; and exalted be the god of the rock of my salvation .
for thou hast girded me with strength to battle : them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me .
thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies , that i might destroy them that hate me .
they looked , but there was none to save ; even unto the lord , but he answered them not .
then did i beat them as small as the dust of the earth , i did stamp them as the mire of the street , and did spread them abroad .
it is god that avengeth me , and that bringeth down the people under me ,
and that bringeth me forth from mine enemies : thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me : thou hast delivered me from the violent man .
i rejoice therefore that i have confidence in you in all things .
and he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief .
and it came to pass , that when jesus had finished these parables , he departed thence .
and when he was come into his own country , he taught them in their synagogue , insomuch that they were astonished , and said , whence hath this man this wisdom , and these mighty works ?
is not this the carpenter ' s son ? is not his mother called mary ? and his brethren , james , and joses , and simon , and judas ?
and his sisters , are they not all with us ? whence then hath this man all these things ?
for godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of : but the sorrow of the world worketh death .
wherefore , though i wrote unto you , i did it not for his cause that had done the wrong , nor for his cause that suffered wrong , but that our care for you in the sight of god might appear unto you .
for if they fall , the one will lift up his fellow : but woe to him that is alone when he falleth ; for he hath not another to help him up .
therefore we were comforted in your comfort : yea , and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of titus , because his spirit was refreshed by you all .
again , if two lie together , then they have heat : but how can one be warm alone ?
for if i have boasted any thing to him of you , i am not ashamed ; but as we spake all things to you in truth , even so our boasting , which i made before titus , is found a truth .
and his inward affection is more abundant toward you , whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all , how with fear and trembling ye received him .
i considered all the living which walk under the sun , with the second child that shall stand up in his stead .
he bowed the heavens also , and came down ; and darkness was under his feet .
for out of prison he cometh to reign ; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor .
better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king , who will no more be admonished .
and if one prevail against him , two shall withstand him ; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken .
through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled .
the lord thundered from heaven , and the most high uttered his voice .
and he rode upon a cherub , and did fly : and he was seen upon the wings of the wind .
and he made darkness pavilions round about him , dark waters , and thick clouds of the skies .
he sent from above , he took me ; he drew me out of many waters ;
and shall cast them into the furnace of fire : there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth .
he delivered me from my strong enemy , and from them that hated me : for they were too strong for me .
and he sent out arrows , and scattered them ; lightning , and discomfited them .
then said he unto them , therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder , which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old .
and the channels of the sea appeared , the foundations of the world were discovered , at the rebuking of the lord , at the blast of the breath of his nostrils .
jesus saith unto them , have ye understood all these things ? they say unto him , yea , lord .
they prevented me in the day of my calamity : but the lord was my stay .
which , when it was full , they drew to shore , and sat down , and gathered the good into vessels , but cast the bad away .
so shall it be at the end of the world : the angels shall come forth , and sever the wicked from among the just ,
who , when he had found one pearl of great price , went and sold all that he had , and bought it .
again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net , that was cast into the sea , and gathered of every kind :
again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field ; the which when a man hath found , he hideth , and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath , and buyeth that field .
again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man , seeking goodly pearls :
and shall cast them into a furnace of fire : there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth .
then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their father . who hath ears to hear , let him hear .
the lord rewarded me according to my righteousness : according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me .
for i have kept the ways of the lord , and have not wickedly departed from my god .
for all his judgments were before me : and as for his statutes , i did not depart from them .
i was also upright before him , and have kept myself from mine iniquity .
therefore the lord hath recompensed me according to my righteousness ; according to my cleanness in his eye sight .
with the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful , and with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright .
the son of man shall send forth his angels , and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend , and them which do iniquity ;
with the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure ; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury .
as therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire ; so shall it be in the end of this world .
and the afflicted people thou wilt save : but thine eyes are upon the haughty , that thou mayest bring them down .
for thou art my lamp , o lord : and the lord will lighten my darkness .
and at taberah , and at massah , and at kibroth - hattaavah , ye provoked the lord to wrath .
and i took your sin , the calf which ye had made , and burnt it with fire , and stamped it , and ground it very small , even until it was as small as dust : and i cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount .
and the lord was very angry with aaron to have destroyed him : and i prayed for aaron also the same time .
i prayed therefore unto the lord , and said , o lord god , destroy not thy people and thine inheritance , which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness , which thou hast brought forth out of egypt with a mighty hand .
thus i fell down before the lord forty days and forty nights , as i fell down at the first ; because the lord had said he would destroy you .
ye have been rebellious against the lord from the day that i knew you .
likewise when the lord sent you from kadesh - barnea , saying , go up and possess the land which i have given you ; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the lord your god , and ye believed him not , nor hearkened to his voice .
he therefore that despiseth , despiseth not man , but god , who hath also given unto us his holy spirit .
for god hath not called us unto uncleanness , but unto holiness .
but as touching brotherly love ye need not that i write unto you : for ye yourselves are taught of god to love one another .
and i fell down before the lord , as at the first , forty days and forty nights : i did neither eat bread , nor drink water , because of all your sins which ye sinned , in doing wickedly in the sight of the lord , to provoke him to anger .
for i was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure , wherewith the lord was wroth against you to destroy you . but the lord hearkened unto me at that time also .
for ye know what commandments we gave you by the lord jesus .
and i looked , and , behold , ye had sinned against the lord your god , and had made you a molten calf : ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the lord had commanded you .
furthermore then we beseech you , brethren , and exhort you by the lord jesus , that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please god , so ye would abound more and more .
and i took the two tables , and cast them out of my two hands , and brake them before your eyes .
that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour ;
for this is the will of god , even your sanctification , that ye should abstain from fornication :
that no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter : because that the lord is the avenger of all such , as we also have forewarned you and testified .
not in the lust of concupiscence , even as the gentiles which know not god :
circumcision is nothing , and uncircumcision is nothing , but the keeping of the commandments of god .
is any man called being circumcised ? let him not become uncircumcised . is any called in uncircumcision ? let him not be circumcised .
but as god hath distributed to every man , as the lord hath called every one , so let him walk . and so ordain i in all churches .
for what knowest thou , o wife , whether thou shalt save thy husband ? or how knowest thou , o man , whether thou shalt save thy wife ?
but if the unbelieving depart , let him depart . a brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases : but god hath called us to peace .
for the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife , and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband : else were your children unclean ; but now are they holy .
but to the rest speak i , not the lord : if any brother hath a wife that believeth not , and she be pleased to dwell with him , let him not put her away .
but and if she depart , let her remain unmarried , or be reconciled to her husband : and let not the husband put away his wife .
and unto the married i command , yet not i , but the lord , let not the wife depart from her husband :
and many resorted unto him , and said , john did no miracle : but all things that john spake of this man were true .
and went away again beyond jordan into the place where john at first baptized ; and there he abode .
and many believed on him there .
remember thy servants , abraham , isaac , and jacob ; look not unto the stubbornness of this people , nor to their wickedness , nor to their sin :
lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say , because the lord was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them , and because he hated them , he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness .
yet they are thy people and thine inheritance , which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm .
art thou bound unto a wife ? seek not to be loosed . art thou loosed from a wife ? seek not a wife .
i suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress , i say , that it is good for a man so to be .
but this i say , brethren , the time is short : it remaineth , that both they that have wives be as though they had none ;
art thou called being a servant ? care not for it : but if thou mayest be made free , use it rather .
there shall be no more thence an infant of days , nor an old man that hath not filled his days : for the child shall die an hundred years old ; but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed .
and they shall build houses , and inhabit them ; and they shall plant vineyards , and eat the fruit of them .
ye are bought with a price ; be not ye the servants of men .
they shall not build , and another inhabit ; they shall not plant , and another eat : for as the days of a tree are the days of my people , and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands .
for he that is called in the lord , being a servant , is the lord ' s freeman : likewise also he that is called , being free , is christ ' s servant .
they shall not labour in vain , nor bring forth for trouble ; for they are the seed of the blessed of the lord , and their offspring with them .
now concerning virgins i have no commandment of the lord : yet i give my judgment , as one that hath obtained mercy of the lord to be faithful .
and it shall come to pass , that before they call , i will answer ; and while they are yet speaking , i will hear .
brethren , let every man , wherein he is called , therein abide with god .
the wolf and the lamb shall feed together , and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock : and dust shall be the serpent ' s meat . they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain , saith the lord .
furthermore the lord spake unto me , saying , i have seen this people , and , behold , it is a stiffnecked people :
the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth ; but if her husband be dead , she is at liberty to be married to whom she will ; only in the lord .
and the lord said unto me , arise , get thee down quickly from hence ; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of egypt have corrupted themselves ; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which i commanded them ; they have made them a molten image .
so then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well ; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better .
so i turned and came down from the mount , and the mount burned with fire : and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands .
nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart , having no necessity , but hath power over his own will , and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin , doeth well .
let me alone , that i may destroy them , and blot out their name from under heaven : and i will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they .
and it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights , that the lord gave me the two tables of stone , even the tables of the covenant .
but i would have you without carefulness . he that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the lord , how he may please the lord :
and they that use this world , as not abusing it : for the fashion of this world passeth away .
and sharon shall be a fold of flocks , and the valley of achor a place for the herds to lie down in , for my people that have sought me .
and they that weep , as though they wept not ; and they that rejoice , as though they rejoiced not ; and they that buy , as though they possessed not ;
but if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin , if she pass the flower of her age , and need so require , let him do what he will , he sinneth not : let them marry .
and this i speak for your own profit ; not that i may cast a snare upon you , but for that which is comely , and that ye may attend upon the lord without distraction .
behold , my servants shall sing for joy of heart , but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart , and shall howl for vexation of spirit .
there is difference also between a wife and a virgin . the unmarried woman careth for the things of the lord , that she may be holy both in body and in spirit : but she that is married careth for the things of the world , how she may please her husband .
but ye are they that forsake the lord , that forget my holy mountain , that prepare a table for that troop , and that furnish the drink offering unto that number .
but he that is married careth for the things that are of the world , how he may please his wife .
therefore will i number you to the sword , and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter : because when i called , ye did not answer ; when i spake , ye did not hear ; but did evil before mine eyes , and did choose that wherein i delighted not .
but be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which i create : for , behold , i create jerusalem a rejoicing , and her people a joy .
for , behold , i create new heavens and a new earth : and the former shall not be remembered , nor come into mind .
that he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the god of truth ; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the god of truth ; because the former troubles are forgotten , and because they are hid from mine eyes .
and ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen : for the lord god shall slay thee , and call his servants by another name :
and i will rejoice in jerusalem , and joy in my people : and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her , nor the voice of crying .
and the lord said unto moses , write thou these words : for after the tenor of these words i have made a covenant with thee and with israel .
and it came to pass , when moses came down from mount sinai with the two tables of testimony in moses ' hand , when he came down from the mount , that moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him .
thrice in the year shall all your men children appear before the lord god , the god of israel .
the first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the lord thy god . thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother ' s milk .
thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven ; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning .
six days thou shalt work , but on the seventh day thou shalt rest : in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest .
and thou shalt observe the feast of weeks , of the firstfruits of wheat harvest , and the feast of ingathering at the year ' s end .
all that openeth the matrix is mine ; and every firstling among thy cattle , whether ox or sheep , that is male .
thou shalt make thee no molten gods .
and thou take of their daughters unto thy sons , and their daughters go a whoring after their gods , and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods .
lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land , and they go a whoring after their gods , and do sacrifice unto their gods , and one call thee , and thou eat of his sacrifice ;
for thou shalt worship no other god : for the lord , whose name is jealous , is a jealous god :
but ye shall destroy their altars , break their images , and cut down their groves :
take heed to thyself , lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest , lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee :
observe thou that which i command thee this day : behold , i drive out before thee the amorite , and the canaanite , and the hittite , and the perizzite , and the hivite , and the jebusite .
and for the leprosy of a garment , and of a house ,
and for a rising , and for a scab , and for a bright spot :
this is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy , and scall ,
and he shall take the cedar wood , and the hyssop , and the scarlet , and the living bird , and dip them in the blood of the slain bird , and in the running water , and sprinkle the house seven times :
and he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water :
to teach when it is unclean , and when it is clean : this is the law of leprosy .
greet ye one another with a kiss of charity . peace be with you all that are in christ jesus . amen .
the church that is at babylon , elected together with you , saluteth you ; and so doth marcus my son .
by silvanus , a faithful brother unto you , as i suppose , i have written briefly , exhorting , and testifying that this is the true grace of god wherein ye stand .
to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever . amen .
but the god of all grace , who hath called us unto his eternal glory by christ jesus , after that ye have suffered a while , make you perfect , stablish , strengthen , settle you .
because he hath inclined his ear unto me , therefore will i call upon him as long as i live .
the sorrows of death compassed me , and the pains of hell gat hold upon me : i found trouble and sorrow .
i love the lord , because he hath heard my voice and my supplications .
and he shall offer the one of the turtledoves , or of the young pigeons , such as he can get ;
that , according as it is written , he that glorieth , let him glory in the lord .
when ye be come into the land of canaan , which i give to you for a possession , and i put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession ;
and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron , saying ,
this is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy , whose hand is not able to get that which pertaineth to his cleansing .
even such as he is able to get , the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering , with the meat offering : and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed before the lord .
then called i upon the name of the lord ; o lord , i beseech thee , deliver my soul .
gracious is the lord , and righteous ; yea , our god is merciful .
the lord preserveth the simple : i was brought low , and he helped me .
return unto thy rest , o my soul ; for the lord hath dealt bountifully with thee .
but of him are ye in christ jesus , who of god is made unto us wisdom , and righteousness , and sanctification , and redemption :
for thou hast delivered my soul from death , mine eyes from tears , and my feet from falling .
i will walk before the lord in the land of the living .
and he shall look on the plague , and , behold , if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow strakes , greenish or reddish , which in sight are lower than the wall ;
then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house , and shut up the house seven days :
and base things of the world , and things which are despised , hath god chosen , yea , and things which are not , to bring to nought things that are :
and he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest , saying , it seemeth to me there is as it were a plague in the house :
then the priest shall command that they empty the house , before the priest go into it to see the plague , that all that is in the house be not made unclean : and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house :
and the priest shall come again the seventh day , and shall look : and , behold , if the plague be spread in the walls of the house ;
for after that in the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god , it pleased god by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe .
where is the wise ? where is the scribe ? where is the disputer of this world ? hath not god made foolish the wisdom of this world ?
but we preach christ crucified , unto the jews a stumblingblock , and unto the greeks foolishness ;
and he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about , and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place :
for the jews require a sign , and the greeks seek after wisdom :
then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague is , and they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city :
because the foolishness of god is wiser than men ; and the weakness of god is stronger than men .
and if the plague come again , and break out in the house , after that he hath taken away the stones , and after he hath scraped the house , and after it is plaistered ;
but unto them which are called , both jews and greeks , christ the power of god , and the wisdom of god .
and they shall take other stones , and put them in the place of those stones ; and he shall take other morter , and shall plaister the house .
but god hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise ; and god hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty ;
and he shall break down the house , the stones of it , and the timber thereof , and all the morter of the house ; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place .
for ye see your calling , brethren , how that not many wise men after the flesh , not many mighty , not many noble , are called :
and i will send the sword , the famine , and the pestilence , among them , till they be consumed from off the land that i gave unto them and to their fathers .
for christ sent me not to baptize , but to preach the gospel : not with wisdom of words , lest the cross of christ should be made of none effect .
moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even .
for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness ; but unto us which are saved it is the power of god .
and he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes ; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes .
for it is written , i will destroy the wisdom of the wise , and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent .
and if the priest shall come in , and look upon it , and , behold , the plague hath not spread in the house , after the house was plaistered : then the priest shall pronounce the house clean , because the plague is healed .
and he shall take to cleanse the house two birds , and cedar wood , and scarlet , and hyssop :
and for their sakes i sanctify myself , that they also might be sanctified through the truth .
and the priest shall take one he lamb , and offer him for a trespass offering , and the log of oil , and wave them for a wave offering before the lord :
for the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument , neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin ; but the fitches are beaten out with a staff , and the cummin with a rod .
as thou hast sent me into the world , even so have i also sent them into the world .
and the priest that maketh him clean shall present the man that is to be made clean , and those things , before the lord , at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation :
the bloodthirsty hate the upright : but the just seek his soul .
bread corn is bruised ; because he will not ever be threshing it , nor break it with the wheel of his cart , nor bruise it with his horsemen .
and on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without blemish , and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish , and three tenth deals of fine flour for a meat offering , mingled with oil , and one log of oil .
a fool uttereth all his mind : but a wise man keepeth it in till afterwards .
when he hath made plain the face thereof , doth he not cast abroad the fitches , and scatter the cummin , and cast in the principal wheat and the appointed barley and rie in their place ?
for his god doth instruct him to discretion , and doth teach him .
and thus they returned us answer , saying , we are the servants of the god of heaven and earth , and build the house that was builded these many years ago , which a great king of israel builded and set up .
the poor and the deceitful man meet together : the lord lighteneth both their eyes .
but after that our fathers had provoked the god of heaven unto wrath , he gave them into the hand of nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon , the chaldean , who destroyed this house , and carried the people away into babylon .
this also cometh forth from the lord of hosts , which is wonderful in counsel , and excellent in working .
we asked their names also , to certify thee , that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them .
when the wicked are multiplied , transgression increaseth : but the righteous shall see their fall .
and now i am no more in the world , but these are in the world , and i come to thee . holy father , keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me , that they may be one , as we are .
and said unto him , take these vessels , go , carry them into the temple that is in jerusalem , and let the house of god be builded in his place .
also bakbukiah and unni , their brethren , were over against them in the watches .
and all mine are thine , and thine are mine ; and i am glorified in them .
then came the same sheshbazzar , and laid the foundation of the house of god which is in jerusalem : and since that time even until now hath it been in building , and yet it is not finished .
moreover the levites : jeshua , binnui , kadmiel , sherebiah , judah , and mattaniah , which was over the thanksgiving , he and his brethren .
for the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it : and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it .
but in the first year of cyrus the king of babylon the same king cyrus made a decree to build this house of god .
while i was with them in the world , i kept them in thy name : those that thou gavest me i have kept , and none of them is lost , but the son of perdition ; that the scripture might be fulfilled .
i pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world , but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil .
miamin , maadiah , bilgah ,
give ye ear , and hear my voice ; hearken , and hear my speech .
i have given them thy word ; and the world hath hated them , because they are not of the world , even as i am not of the world .
iddo , ginnetho , abijah ,
doth the plowman plow all day to sow ? doth he open and break the clods of his ground ?
sanctify them through thy truth : thy word is truth .
sallu , amok , hilkiah , jedaiah . these were the chief of the priests and of their brethren in the days of jeshua .
for the lord shall rise up as in mount perazim , he shall be wroth as in the valley of gibeon , that he may do his work , his strange work ; and bring to pass his act , his strange act .
they are not of the world , even as i am not of the world .
shemaiah , and joiarib , jediah ,
now therefore be ye not mockers , lest your bands be made strong : for i have heard from the lord god of hosts a consumption , even determined upon the whole earth .
now these are the priests and the levites that went up with zerubbabel the son of shealtiel , and jeshua : seraiah , jeremiah , ezra ,
amariah , malluch , hattush ,
shechaniah , rehum , meremoth ,
after all this , when josiah had prepared the temple , necho king of egypt came up to fight against carchemish by euphrates : and josiah went out against him .
nevertheless josiah would not turn his face from him , but disguised himself , that he might fight with him , and hearkened not unto the words of necho from the mouth of god , and came to fight in the valley of megiddo .
and the priest shall offer the sin offering , and make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness ; and afterward he shall kill the burnt offering :
his servants therefore took him out of that chariot , and put him in the second chariot that he had ; and they brought him to jerusalem , and he died , and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers . and all judah and jerusalem mourned for josiah .
and of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed , and upon the thumb of his right hand , and upon the great toe of his right foot , upon the blood of the trespass offering :
and the archers shot at king josiah ; and the king said to his servants , have me away ; for i am sore wounded .
and the remnant of the oil that is in the priest ' s hand he shall pour upon the head of him that is to be cleansed : and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the lord .
now the rest of the acts of josiah , and his goodness , according to that which was written in the law of the lord ,
and the priest shall take some of the log of oil , and pour it into the palm of his own left hand :
and jeremiah lamented for josiah : and all the singing men and the singing women spake of josiah in their lamentations to this day , and made them an ordinance in israel : and , behold , they are written in the lamentations .
and he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin offering and the burnt offering , in the holy place : for as the sin offering is the priest ' s , so is the trespass offering : it is most holy :
and the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering , and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed , and upon the thumb of his right hand , and upon the great toe of his right foot :
for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion : in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me ; he shall set me up upon a rock .
and the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meat offering upon the altar : and the priest shall make an atonement for him , and he shall be clean .
and now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me : therefore will i offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy ; i will sing , yea , i will sing praises unto the lord .
as a snail which melteth , let every one of them pass away : like the untimely birth of a woman , that they may not see the sun .
and he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing unto the priest , unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , before the lord .
hear , o lord , when i cry with my voice : have mercy also upon me , and answer me .
before your pots can feel the thorns , he shall take them away as with a whirlwind , both living , and in his wrath .
in the eighteenth year of the reign of josiah was this passover kept .
and two turtledoves , or two young pigeons , such as he is able to get ; and the one shall be a sin offering , and the other a burnt offering .
when thou saidst , seek ye my face ; my heart said unto thee , thy face , lord , will i seek .
hide not thy face far from me ; put not thy servant away in anger : thou hast been my help ; leave me not , neither forsake me , o god of my salvation .
father , i will that they also , whom thou hast given me , be with me where i am ; that they may behold my glory , which thou hast given me : for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world .
i in them , and thou in me , that they may be made perfect in one ; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me , and hast loved them , as thou hast loved me .
and the glory which thou gavest me i have given them ; that they may be one , even as we are one :
do ye indeed speak righteousness , o congregation ? do ye judge uprightly , o ye sons of men ?
that they all may be one ; as thou , father , art in me , and i in thee , that they also may be one in us : that the world may believe that thou hast sent me .
yea , in heart ye work wickedness ; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth .
the lord is my light and my salvation ; whom shall i fear ? the lord is the strength of my life ; of whom shall i be afraid ?
the wicked are estranged from the womb : they go astray as soon as they be born , speaking lies .
when the wicked , even mine enemies and my foes , came upon me to eat up my flesh , they stumbled and fell .
their poison is like the poison of a serpent : they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear ;
and i have declared unto them thy name , and will declare it : that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them , and i in them .
though an host should encamp against me , my heart shall not fear : though war should rise against me , in this will i be confident .
which will not hearken to the voice of charmers , charming never so wisely .
o righteous father , the world hath not known thee : but i have known thee , and these have known that thou hast sent me .
one thing have i desired of the lord , that will i seek after ; that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life , to behold the beauty of the lord , and to inquire in his temple .
break their teeth , o god , in their mouth : break out the great teeth of the young lions , o lord .
neither pray i for these alone , but for them also which shall believe on me through their word ;
and they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance : but the other holy offerings sod they in pots , and in caldrons , and in pans , and divided them speedily among all the people .
and the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed , and upon the thumb of his right hand , and upon the great toe of his right foot , upon the place of the blood of the trespass offering :
and they removed the burnt offerings , that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people , to offer unto the lord , as it is written in the book of moses . and so did they with the oxen .
and the rest of the oil that is in the priest ' s hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed , to make an atonement for him before the lord .
and they killed the passover , and the priests sprinkled the blood from their hands , and the levites flayed them .
so the service was prepared , and the priests stood in their place , and the levites in their courses , according to the king ' s commandment .
and the children of israel that were present kept the passover at that time , and the feast of unleavened bread seven days .
and the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering , and the log of oil , and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the lord :
so all the service of the lord was prepared the same day , to keep the passover , and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the lord , according to the commandment of king josiah .
and afterward they made ready for themselves , and for the priests : because the priests the sons of aaron were busied in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night ; therefore the levites prepared for themselves , and for the priests the sons of aaron .
and the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before the lord :
and it came to pass , when jabin king of hazor had heard those things , that he sent to jobab king of madon , and to the king of shimron , and to the king of achshaph ,
now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me : it is good for a man not to touch a woman .
and to the kings that were on the north of the mountains , and of the plains south of chinneroth , and in the valley , and in the borders of dor on the west ,
and to the canaanite on the east and on the west , and to the amorite , and the hittite , and the perizzite , and the jebusite in the mountains , and to the hivite under hermon in the land of mizpeh .
let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence : and likewise also the wife unto the husband .
and they went out , they and all their hosts with them , much people , even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude , with horses and chariots very many .
nevertheless , to avoid fornication , let every man have his own wife , and let every woman have her own husband .
and when all these kings were met together , they came and pitched together at the waters of merom , to fight against israel .
and the lord said unto joshua , be not afraid because of them : for to morrow about this time will i deliver them up all slain before israel : thou shalt hough their horses , and burn their chariots with fire .
so joshua came , and all the people of war with him , against them by the waters of merom suddenly ; and they fell upon them .
and the lord delivered them into the hand of israel , who smote them , and chased them unto great zidon , and unto misrephoth - maim , and unto the valley of mizpeh eastward ; and they smote them , until they left them none remaining .
and joshua did unto them as the lord bade him : he houghed their horses , and burnt their chariots with fire .
and from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away , and the abomination that maketh desolate set up , there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days .
blessed is he that waiteth , and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days .
but go thou thy way till the end be : for thou shalt rest , and stand in thy lot at the end of the days .
many shall be purified , and made white , and tried ; but the wicked shall do wickedly : and none of the wicked shall understand ; but the wise shall understand .
if they say thus unto us , tarry until we come to you ; then we will stand still in our place , and will not go up unto them .
then said jonathan , behold , we will pass over unto these men , and we will discover ourselves unto them .
and his armourbearer said unto him , do all that is in thine heart : turn thee ; behold , i am with thee according to thy heart .
and jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour , come , and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised : it may be that the lord will work for us : for there is no restraint to the lord to save by many or by few .
i say therefore to the unmarried and widows , it is good for them if they abide even as i .
the forefront of the one was situate northward over against michmash , and the other southward over against gibeah .
but if they cannot contain , let them marry : for it is better to marry than to burn .
and between the passages , by which jonathan sought to go over unto the philistines ' garrison , there was a sharp rock on the one side and a sharp rock on the other side : and the name of the one was bozez , and the name of the other seneh .
but i speak this by permission , and not of commandment .
and ahiah , the son of ahitub , i - chabod ' s brother , the son of phinehas , the son of eli , the lord ' s priest in shiloh , wearing an ephod . and the people knew not that jonathan was gone .
for i would that all men were even as i myself . but every man hath his proper gift of god , one after this manner , and another after that .
and saul tarried in the uttermost part of gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in migron : and the people that were with him were about six hundred men ;
the wife hath not power of her own body , but the husband : and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body , but the wife .
now it came to pass upon a day , that jonathan the son of saul said unto the young man that bare his armour , come , and let us go over to the philistines ' garrison , that is on the other side . but he told not his father .
defraud ye not one the other , except it be with consent for a time , that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer ; and come together again , that satan tempt you not for your incontinency .
egypt is like a very fair heifer , but destruction cometh ; it cometh out of the north .
also her hired men are in the midst of her like fatted bullocks ; for they also are turned back , and are fled away together : they did not stand , because the day of their calamity was come upon them , and the time of their visitation .
the voice thereof shall go like a serpent ; for they shall march with an army , and come against her with axes , as hewers of wood .
they shall cut down her forest , saith the lord , though it cannot be searched ; because they are more than the grasshoppers , and are innumerable .
the daughter of egypt shall be confounded ; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north .
the lord of hosts , the god of israel , saith ; behold , i will punish the multitude of no , and pharaoh , and egypt , with their gods , and their kings ; even pharaoh , and all them that trust in him :
and i will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives , and into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon , and into the hand of his servants : and afterward it shall be inhabited , as in the days of old , saith the lord .
but fear not thou , o my servant jacob , and be not dismayed , o israel : for , behold , i will save thee from afar off , and thy seed from the land of their captivity ; and jacob shall return , and be in rest and at ease , and none shall make him afraid .
and it came to pass in the fourth year of king hezekiah , which was the seventh year of hoshea son of elah king of israel , that shalmaneser king of assyria came up against samaria , and besieged it .
o thou daughter dwelling in egypt , furnish thyself to go into captivity : for noph shall be waste and desolate without an inhabitant .
as i live , saith the king , whose name is the lord of hosts , surely as tabor is among the mountains , and as carmel by the sea , so shall he come .
he trusted in the lord god of israel ; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of judah , nor any that were before him .
for he clave to the lord , and departed not from following him , but kept his commandments , which the lord commanded moses .
and the lord was with him ; and he prospered whithersoever he went forth : and he rebelled against the king of assyria , and served him not .
he smote the philistines , even unto gaza , and the borders thereof , from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city .
now it came to pass in the third year of hoshea son of elah king of israel , that hezekiah the son of ahaz king of judah began to reign .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord , according to all that david his father did .
he removed the high places , and brake the images , and cut down the groves , and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that moses had made : for unto those days the children of israel did burn incense to it : and he called it nehushtan .
the nations have heard of thy shame , and thy cry hath filled the land : for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty , and they are fallen both together .
go up into gilead , and take balm , o virgin , the daughter of egypt : in vain shalt thou use many medicines ; for thou shalt not be cured .
he made many to fall , yea , one fell upon another : and they said , arise , and let us go again to our own people , and to the land of our nativity , from the oppressing sword .
they did cry there , pharaoh king of egypt is but a noise ; he hath passed the time appointed .
declare ye in egypt , and publish in migdol , and publish in noph and in tahpanhes : say ye , stand fast , and prepare thee ; for the sword shall devour round about thee .
why are thy valiant men swept away ? they stood not , because the lord did drive them .
rejoice , o young man , in thy youth ; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth , and walk in the ways of thine heart , and in the sight of thine eyes : but know thou , that for all these things god will bring thee into judgment .
give a portion to seven , and also to eight ; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth .
cast thy bread upon the waters : for thou shalt find it after many days .
he that observeth the wind shall not sow ; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap .
if the clouds be full of rain , they empty themselves upon the earth : and if the tree fall toward the south , or toward the north , in the place where the tree falleth , there it shall be .
in the morning sow thy seed , and in the evening withhold not thine hand : for thou knowest not whether shall prosper , either this or that , or whether they both shall be alike good .
as thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit , nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child : even so thou knowest not the works of god who maketh all .
but if a man live many years , and rejoice in them all ; yet let him remember the days of darkness ; for they shall be many . all that cometh is vanity .
truly the light is sweet , and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun :
the son of shallum , the son of zadok , the son of ahitub ,
the son of amariah , the son of azariah , the son of meraioth ,
now after these things , in the reign of artaxerxes king of persia , ezra the son of seraiah , the son of azariah , the son of hilkiah ,
in the first month , that is , the month nisan , in the twelfth year of king ahasuerus , they cast pur , that is , the lot , before haman from day to day , and from month to month , to the twelfth month , that is , the month adar .
and haman said unto king ahasuerus , there is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom ; and their laws are diverse from all people ; neither keep they the king ' s laws : therefore it is not for the king ' s profit to suffer them .
if it please the king , let it be written that they may be destroyed : and i will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business , to bring it into the king ' s treasuries .
after these things did king ahasuerus promote haman the son of hammedatha the agagite , and advanced him , and set his seat above all the princes that were with him .
and all the king ' s servants , that were in the king ' s gate , bowed , and reverenced haman : for the king had so commanded concerning him . but mordecai bowed not , nor did him reverence .
then the king ' s servants , which were in the king ' s gate , said unto mordecai , why transgressest thou the king ' s commandment ?
now it came to pass , when they spake daily unto him , and he hearkened not unto them , that they told haman , to see whether mordecai ' s matters would stand : for he had told them that he was a jew .
and when haman saw that mordecai bowed not , nor did him reverence , then was haman full of wrath .
and he thought scorn to lay hands on mordecai alone ; for they had shewed him the people of mordecai : wherefore haman sought to destroy all the jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of ahasuerus , even the people of mordecai .
and he came to jerusalem in the fifth month , which was in the seventh year of the king .
for upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from babylon , and on the first day of the fifth month came he to jerusalem , according to the good hand of his god upon him .
the son of zerahiah , the son of uzzi , the son of bukki ,
this ezra went up from babylon ; and he was a ready scribe in the law of moses , which the lord god of israel had given : and the king granted him all his request , according to the hand of the lord his god upon him .
and there went up some of the children of israel , and of the priests , and the levites , and the singers , and the porters , and the nethinims , unto jerusalem , in the seventh year of artaxerxes the king .
persecuted , but not forsaken ; cast down , but not destroyed ;
we are troubled on every side , yet not distressed ; we are perplexed , but not in despair ;
but we have this treasure in earthen vessels , that the excellency of the power may be of god , and not of us .
for god , who commanded the light to shine out of darkness , hath shined in our hearts , to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ .
and the coast of og king of bashan , which was of the remnant of the giants , that dwelt at ashtaroth and at edrei ,
and from the plain to the sea of chinneroth on the east , and unto the sea of the plain , even the salt sea on the east , the way to beth - jeshimoth ; and from the south , under ashdoth - pisgah :
sihon king of the amorites , who dwelt in heshbon , and ruled from aroer , which is upon the bank of the river arnon , and from the middle of the river , and from half gilead , even unto the river jabbok , which is the border of the children of ammon ;
therefore seeing we have this ministry , as we have received mercy , we faint not ;
now these are the kings of the land , which the children of israel smote , and possessed their land on the other side jordan toward the rising of the sun , from the river arnon unto mount hermon , and all the plain on the east :
but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty , not walking in craftiness , nor handling the word of god deceitfully ; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man ' s conscience in the sight of god .
in the mountains , and in the valleys , and in the plains , and in the springs , and in the wilderness , and in the south country ; the hittites , the amorites , and the canaanites , the perizzites , the hivites , and the jebusites :
but if our gospel be hid , it is hid to them that are lost :
in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not , lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ , who is the image of god , should shine unto them .
them did moses the servant of the lord and the children of israel smite : and moses the servant of the lord gave it for a possession unto the reubenites , and the gadites , and the half tribe of manasseh .
for we preach not ourselves , but christ jesus the lord ; and ourselves your servants for jesus ' sake .
and reigned in mount hermon , and in salcah , and in all bashan , unto the border of the geshurites and the maachathites , and half gilead , the border of sihon king of heshbon .
the king of jericho , one ; the king of ai , which is beside bethel , one ;
and from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence , and the violent take it by force .
verily i say unto you , among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than john the baptist : notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he .
and if ye will receive it , this is elias , which was for to come .
for all the prophets and the law prophesied until john .
for this is he , of whom it is written , behold , i send my messenger before thy face , which shall prepare thy way before thee .
the son of man came eating and drinking , and they say , behold a man gluttonous , and a winebibber , a friend of publicans and sinners . but wisdom is justified of her children .
but whereunto shall i liken this generation ? it is like unto children sitting in the markets , and calling unto their fellows ,
he that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
for john came neither eating nor drinking , and they say , he hath a devil .
and saying , we have piped unto you , and ye have not danced ; we have mourned unto you , and ye have not lamented .
and he wept aloud : and the egyptians and the house of pharaoh heard .
then said solomon , the lord hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness .
but i have built an house of habitation for thee , and a place for thy dwelling for ever .
now it was in the heart of david my father to build an house for the name of the lord god of israel .
but the lord said to david my father , forasmuch as it was in thine heart to build an house for my name , thou didst well in that it was in thine heart :
notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house ; but thy son which shall come forth out of thy loins , he shall build the house for my name .
and the king turned his face , and blessed the whole congregation of israel : and all the congregation of israel stood .
and he said , blessed be the lord god of israel , who hath with his hands fulfilled that which he spake with his mouth to my father david , saying ,
since the day that i brought forth my people out of the land of egypt i chose no city among all the tribes of israel to build an house in , that my name might be there ; neither chose i any man to be a ruler over my people israel :
but i have chosen jerusalem , that my name might be there ; and have chosen david to be over my people israel .
then abram removed his tent , and came and dwelt in the plain of mamre , which is in hebron , and built there an altar unto the lord .
arise , walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it ; for i will give it unto thee .
abram dwelled in the land of canaan , and lot dwelled in the cities of the plain , and pitched his tent toward sodom .
haste ye , and go up to my father , and say unto him , thus saith thy son joseph , god hath made me lord of all egypt : come down unto me , tarry not :
then lot chose him all the plain of jordan ; and lot journeyed east : and they separated themselves the one from the other .
and lot lifted up his eyes , and beheld all the plain of jordan , that it was well watered every where , before the lord destroyed sodom and gomorrah , even as the garden of the lord , like the land of egypt , as thou comest unto zoar .
and god sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth , and to save your lives by a great deliverance .
so now it was not you that sent me hither , but god : and he hath made me a father to pharaoh , and lord of all his house , and a ruler throughout all the land of egypt .
and i will make thy seed as the dust of the earth : so that if a man can number the dust of the earth , then shall thy seed also be numbered .
now therefore be not grieved , nor angry with yourselves , that ye sold me hither : for god did send me before you to preserve life .
for all the land which thou seest , to thee will i give it , and to thy seed for ever .
for these two years hath the famine been in the land : and yet there are five years , in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest .
and the lord said unto abram , after that lot was separated from him , lift up now thine eyes , and look from the place where thou art northward , and southward , and eastward , and westward :
and joseph said unto his brethren , i am joseph ; doth my father yet live ? and his brethren could not answer him ; for they were troubled at his presence .
but the men of sodom were wicked and sinners before the lord exceedingly .
now i beseech you , brethren , by the name of our lord jesus christ , that ye all speak the same thing , and that there be no divisions among you ; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment .
for it hath been declared unto me of you , my brethren , by them which are of the house of chloe , that there are contentions among you .
now this i say , that every one of you saith , i am of paul ; and i of apollos ; and i of cephas ; and i of christ .
is christ divided ? was paul crucified for you ? or were ye baptized in the name of paul ?
i thank god that i baptized none of you , but crispus and gaius ;
therefore their goods shall become a booty , and their houses a desolation : they shall also build houses , but not inhabit them ; and they shall plant vineyards , but not drink the wine thereof .
the great day of the lord is near , it is near , and hasteth greatly , even the voice of the day of the lord : the mighty man shall cry there bitterly .
a day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities , and against the high towers .
and it shall come to pass in that day , saith the lord , that there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate , and an howling from the second , and a great crashing from the hills .
howl , ye inhabitants of maktesh , for all the merchant people are cut down ; all they that bear silver are cut off .
and it shall come to pass at that time , that i will search jerusalem with candles , and punish the men that are settled on their lees : that say in their heart , the lord will not do good , neither will he do evil .
and i will bring distress upon men , that they shall walk like blind men , because they have sinned against the lord : and their blood shall be poured out as dust , and their flesh as the dung .
neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the lord ' s wrath ; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy : for he shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land .
and the lord said unto moses , lo , i come unto thee in a thick cloud , that the people may hear when i speak with thee , and believe thee for ever . and moses told the words of the people unto the lord .
and all the people answered together , and said , all that the lord hath spoken we will do . and moses returned the words of the people unto the lord .
and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests , and an holy nation . these are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of israel .
judgment also will i lay to the line , and righteousness to the plummet : and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies , and the waters shall overflow the hiding place .
and moses came and called for the elders of the people , and laid before their faces all these words which the lord commanded him .
ye have seen what i did unto the egyptians , and how i bare you on eagles ' wings , and brought you unto myself .
thy mother is like a vine in thy blood , planted by the waters : she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters .
now therefore , if ye will obey my voice indeed , and keep my covenant , then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people : for all the earth is mine :
wherefore hear the word of the lord , ye scornful men , that rule this people which is in jerusalem .
for they were departed from rephidim , and were come to the desert of sinai , and had pitched in the wilderness ; and there israel camped before the mount .
but she was plucked up in fury , she was cast down to the ground , and the east wind dried up her fruit : her strong rods were broken and withered ; the fire consumed them .
and she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule , and her stature was exalted among the thick branches , and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches .
from the time that it goeth forth it shall take you : for morning by morning shall it pass over , by day and by night : and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report .
and fire is gone out of a rod of her branches , which hath devoured her fruit , so that she hath no strong rod to be a sceptre to rule . this is a lamentation , and shall be for a lamentation .
in the third month , when the children of israel were gone forth out of the land of egypt , the same day came they into the wilderness of sinai .
and your covenant with death shall be disannulled , and your agreement with hell shall not stand ; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through , then ye shall be trodden down by it .
and now she is planted in the wilderness , in a dry and thirsty ground .
but the word of the lord was unto them precept upon precept , precept upon precept ; line upon line , line upon line ; here a little , and there a little ; that they might go , and fall backward , and be broken , and snared , and taken .
for with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people .
for precept must be upon precept , precept upon precept ; line upon line , line upon line ; here a little , and there a little :
because they met not the children of israel with bread and with water , but hired balaam against them , that he should curse them : howbeit our god turned the curse into a blessing .
on that day they read in the book of moses in the audience of the people ; and therein was found written , that the ammonite and the moabite should not come into the congregation of god for ever ;
there went in two and two unto noah into the ark , the male and the female , as god had commanded noah .
of fowls also of the air by sevens , the male and the female ; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth .
and the lord said unto noah , come thou and all thy house into the ark ; for thee have i seen righteous before me in this generation .
of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens , the male and his female : and of beasts that are not clean by two , the male and his female .
and noah went in , and his sons , and his wife , and his sons ' wives with him , into the ark , because of the waters of the flood .
of clean beasts , and of beasts that are not clean , and of fowls , and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth ,
and noah did according unto all that the lord commanded him .
and noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth .
thou art worthy , o lord , to receive glory and honour and power : for thou hast created all things , and for thy pleasure they are and were created .
then i commanded , and they cleansed the chambers : and thither brought i again the vessels of the house of god , with the meat offering and the frankincense .
the four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne , and worship him that liveth for ever and ever , and cast their crowns before the throne , saying ,
and i came to jerusalem , and understood of the evil that eliashib did for tobiah , in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of god .
and it grieved me sore : therefore i cast forth all the household stuff of tobiah out of the chamber .
but in all this time was not i at jerusalem : for in the two and thirtieth year of artaxerxes king of babylon came i unto the king , and after certain days obtained i leave of the king :
now it came to pass , when they had heard the law , that they separated from israel all the mixed multitude .
and before this , eliashib the priest , having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our god , was allied unto tobiah :
and when aaron and all the children of israel saw moses , behold , the skin of his face shone ; and they were afraid to come nigh him .
and till moses had done speaking with them , he put a vail on his face .
and afterward all the children of israel came nigh : and he gave them in commandment all that the lord had spoken with him in mount sinai .
for when they shall say , peace and safety ; then sudden destruction cometh upon them , as travail upon a woman with child ; and they shall not escape .
for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the lord so cometh as a thief in the night .
ye are all the children of light , and the children of the day : we are not of the night , nor of darkness .
but ye , brethren , are not in darkness , that that day should overtake you as a thief .
but when moses went in before the lord to speak with him , he took the vail off , until he came out . and he came out , and spake unto the children of israel that which he was commanded .
and the children of israel saw the face of moses , that the skin of moses ' face shone : and moses put the vail upon his face again , until he went in to speak with him .
but of the times and the seasons , brethren , ye have no need that i write unto you .
therefore let us not sleep , as do others ; but let us watch and be sober .
for god hath not appointed us to wrath , but to obtain salvation by our lord jesus christ ,
but let us , who are of the day , be sober , putting on the breastplate of faith and love ; and for an helmet , the hope of salvation .
the wicked shall see it , and be grieved ; he shall gnash with his teeth , and melt away : the desire of the wicked shall perish .
and many of them said , he hath a devil , and is mad ; why hear ye him ?
then came the jews round about him , and said unto him , how long dost thou make us to doubt ? if thou be the christ , tell us plainly .
then shalt thou be clear from this my oath , when thou comest to my kindred ; and if they give not thee one , thou shalt be clear from my oath .
jesus answered them , i told you , and ye believed not : the works that i do in my father ' s name , they bear witness of me .
and he said unto me , the lord , before whom i walk , will send his angel with thee , and prosper thy way ; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred , and of my father ' s house :
and it was at jerusalem the feast of the dedication , and it was winter .
and jesus walked in the temple in solomon ' s porch .
and i give unto them eternal life ; and they shall never perish , neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand .
my father , which gave them me , is greater than all ; and no man is able to pluck them out of my father ' s hand .
but ye believe not , because ye are not of my sheep , as i said unto you .
my sheep hear my voice , and i know them , and they follow me :
and my master made me swear , saying , thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the canaanites , in whose land i dwell :
but thou shalt go unto my father ' s house , and to my kindred , and take a wife unto my son .
there was a division therefore again among the jews for these sayings .
and sarah my master ' s wife bare a son to my master when she was old : and unto him hath he given all that he hath .
and there was set meat before him to eat : but he said , i will not eat , until i have told mine errand . and he said , speak on .
and he said , i am abraham ' s servant .
and he said , come in , thou blessed of the lord ; wherefore standest thou without ? for i have prepared the house , and room for the camels .
and the man came into the house : and he ungirded his camels , and gave straw and provender for the camels , and water to wash his feet , and the men ' s feet that were with him .
and i said unto my master , peradventure the woman will not follow me .
i and my father are one .
then the jews took up stones again to stone him .
jesus answered them , many good works have i shewed you from my father ; for which of those works do ye stone me ?
the jews answered him , saying , for a good work we stone thee not ; but for blasphemy ; and because that thou , being a man , makest thyself god .
then laban and bethuel answered and said , the thing proceedeth from the lord : we cannot speak unto thee bad or good .
jesus answered them , is it not written in your law , i said , ye are gods ?
if he called them gods , unto whom the word of god came , and the scripture cannot be broken ;
and it came to pass , that , when abraham ' s servant heard their words , he worshipped the lord , bowing himself to the earth .
say ye of him , whom the father hath sanctified , and sent into the world , thou blasphemest ; because i said , i am the son of god ?
behold , rebekah is before thee , take her , and go , and let her be thy master ' s son ' s wife , as the lord hath spoken .
if i do not the works of my father , believe me not .
but if i do , though ye believe not me , believe the works : that ye may know , and believe , that the father is in me , and i in him .
therefore they sought again to take him : but he escaped out of their hand ,
and she made haste , and let down her pitcher from her shoulder , and said , drink , and i will give thy camels drink also : so i drank , and she made the camels drink also .
when i say , my bed shall comfort me , my couch shall ease my complaint ;
shall iron break the northern iron and the steel ?
and i asked her , and said , whose daughter art thou ? and she said , the daughter of bethuel , nahor ' s son , whom milcah bare unto him : and i put the earring upon her face , and the bracelets upon her hands .
then thou scarest me with dreams , and terrifiest me through visions :
thy substance and thy treasures will i give to the spoil without price , and that for all thy sins , even in all thy borders .
and i bowed down my head , and worshipped the lord , and blessed the lord god of my master abraham , which had led me in the right way to take my master ' s brother ' s daughter unto his son .
therefore i will not refrain my mouth ; i will speak in the anguish of my spirit ; i will complain in the bitterness of my soul .
and i will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not : for a fire is kindled in mine anger , which shall burn upon you .
and now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master , tell me : and if not , tell me ; that i may turn to the right hand , or to the left .
am i a sea , or a whale , that thou settest a watch over me ?
and i came this day unto the well , and said , o lord god of my master abraham , if now thou do prosper my way which i go ;
think upon me , my god , for good , according to all that i have done for this people .
thy words were found , and i did eat them ; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart : for i am called by thy name , o lord god of hosts .
behold , i stand by the well of water ; and it shall come to pass , that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water , and i say to her , give me , i pray thee , a little water of thy pitcher to drink ;
he shall return no more to his house , neither shall his place know him any more .
i sat not in the assembly of the mockers , nor rejoiced ; i sat alone because of thy hand : for thou hast filled me with indignation .
and she say to me , both drink thou , and i will also draw for thy camels : let the same be the woman whom the lord hath appointed out for my master ' s son .
moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the jews and rulers , beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that are about us .
why is my pain perpetual , and my wound incurable , which refuseth to be healed ? wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar , and as waters that fail ?
and before i had done speaking in mine heart , behold , rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder ; and she went down unto the well , and drew water : and i said unto her , let me drink , i pray thee .
now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sheep ; also fowls were prepared for me , and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine : yet for all this required not i the bread of the governor , because the bondage was heavy upon this people .
therefore thus saith the lord , if thou return , then will i bring thee again , and thou shalt stand before me : and if thou take forth the precious from the vile , thou shalt be as my mouth : let them return unto thee ; but return not thou unto them .
for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother , and shall be joined unto his wife , and they two shall be one flesh .
but the former governors that had been before me were chargeable unto the people , and had taken of them bread and wine , beside forty shekels of silver ; yea , even their servants bare rule over the people : but so did not i , because of the fear of god .
yea , also i continued in the work of this wall , neither bought we any land : and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work .
nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself ; and the wife see that she reverence her husband .
how long wilt thou not depart from me , nor let me alone till i swallow down my spittle ?
moreover from the time that i was appointed to be their governor in the land of judah , from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of artaxerxes the king , that is , twelve years , i and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor .
restore , i pray you , to them , even this day , their lands , their vineyards , their oliveyards , and their houses , also the the hundredth part of the money , and of the corn , the wine , and the oil , that ye exact of them .
what is man , that thou shouldest magnify him ? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him ?
then said they , we will restore them , and will require nothing of them ; so will we do as thou sayest . then i called the priests , and took an oath of them , that they should do according to this promise .
and that thou shouldest visit him every morning , and try him every moment ?
so that my soul chooseth strangling , and death rather than my life .
woe is me , my mother , that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth ! i have neither lent on usury , nor men have lent to me on usury ; yet every one of them doth curse me .
for we are members of his body , of his flesh , and of his bones .
i likewise , and my brethren , and my servants , might exact of them money and corn : i pray you , let us leave off this usury .
i loathe it ; i would not live alway : let me alone ; for my days are vanity .
the lord said , verily it shall be well with thy remnant ; verily i will cause the enemy to entreat thee well in the time of evil and in the time of affliction .
my friends scorn me : but mine eye poureth out tears unto god .
o that one might plead for a man with god , as a man pleadeth for his neighbour !
when a few years are come , then i shall go the way whence i shall not return .
and he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening , even the time that women go out to draw water .
and he said , o lord god of my master abraham , i pray thee , send me good speed this day , and shew kindness unto my master abraham .
and the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master , and departed ; for all the goods of his master were in his hand : and he arose , and went to mesopotamia , unto the city of nahor .
and it came to pass , before he had done speaking , that , behold , rebekah came out , who was born to bethuel , son of milcah , the wife of nahor , abraham ' s brother , with her pitcher upon her shoulder .
and the damsel was very fair to look upon , a virgin , neither had any man known her : and she went down to the well , and filled her pitcher , and came up .
behold , i stand here by the well of water ; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water :
and when she had done giving him drink , she said , i will draw water for thy camels also , until they have done drinking .
and the servant ran to meet her , and said , let me , i pray thee , drink a little water of thy pitcher .
and i will plant them upon their land , and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land which i have given them , saith the lord thy god .
the thief cometh not , but for to steal , and to kill , and to destroy : i am come that they might have life , and that they might have it more abundantly .
wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret .
for if i pray in an unknown tongue , my spirit prayeth , but my understanding is unfruitful .
and other sheep i have , which are not of this fold : them also i must bring , and they shall hear my voice ; and there shall be one fold , and one shepherd .
what is it then ? i will pray with the spirit , and i will pray with the understanding also : i will sing with the spirit , and i will sing with the understanding also .
therefore doth my father love me , because i lay down my life , that i might take it again .
else when thou shalt bless with the spirit , how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say amen at thy giving of thanks , seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest ?
no man taketh it from me , but i lay it down of myself . i have power to lay it down , and i have power to take it again . this commandment have i received of my father .
for thou verily givest thanks well , but the other is not edified .
i am the good shepherd : the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep .
i thank my god , i speak with tongues more than ye all :
but he that is an hireling , and not the shepherd , whose own the sheep are not , seeth the wolf coming , and leaveth the sheep , and fleeth : and the wolf catcheth them , and scattereth the sheep .
yet in the church i had rather speak five words with my understanding , that by my voice i might teach others also , than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue .
the hireling fleeth , because he is an hireling , and careth not for the sheep .
and it came to pass , when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister ' s hands , and when he heard the words of rebekah his sister , saying , thus spake the man unto me ; that he came unto the man ; and , behold , he stood by the camels at the well .
i am the good shepherd , and know my sheep , and am known of mine .
and the man wondering at her held his peace , to wit whether the lord had made his journey prosperous or not .
and it came to pass , as the camels had done drinking , that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight , and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold ;
and said , whose daughter art thou ? tell me , i pray thee : is there room in thy father ' s house for us to lodge in ?
there are , it may be , so many kinds of voices in the world , and none of them is without signification .
and she said unto him , i am the daughter of bethuel the son of milcah , which she bare unto nahor .
she said moreover unto him , we have both straw and provender enough , and room to lodge in .
even so ye , forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts , seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church .
and the man bowed down his head , and worshipped the lord .
therefore if i know not the meaning of the voice , i shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian , and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me .
and he said , blessed be the lord god of my master abraham , who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth : i being in the way , the lord led me to the house of my master ' s brethren .
and the damsel ran , and told them of her mother ' s house these things .
and rebekah had a brother , and his name was laban : and laban ran out unto the man , unto the well .
all the sinners of my people shall die by the sword , which say , the evil shall not overtake nor prevent us .
that they may possess the remnant of edom , and of all the heathen , which are called by my name , saith the lord that doeth this .
in that day will i raise up the tabernacle of david that is fallen , and close up the breaches thereof ; and i will raise up his ruins , and i will build it as in the days of old :
and i will bring again the captivity of my people of israel , and they shall build the waste cities , and inhabit them ; and they shall plant vineyards , and drink the wine thereof ; they shall also make gardens , and eat the fruit of them .
behold , the days come , saith the lord , that the plowman shall overtake the reaper , and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed ; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine , and all the hills shall melt .
on the south side shall be the standard of the camp of reuben according to their armies : and the captain of the children of reuben shall be elizur the son of shedeur .
o israel , trust thou in the lord : he is their help and their shield .
let the prophets speak two or three , and let the other judge .
but if there be no interpreter , let him keep silence in the church ; and let him speak to himself , and to god .
if any man speak in an unknown tongue , let it be by two , or at the most by three , and that by course ; and let one interpret .
they have mouths , but they speak not : eyes have they , but they see not :
how is it then , brethren ? when ye come together , everyone of you hath a psalm , hath a doctrine , hath a tongue , hath a revelation , hath an interpretation . let all things be done unto edifying .
they have ears , but they hear not : noses have they , but they smell not :
and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest ; and so falling down on his face he will worship god , and report that god is in you of a truth .
they have hands , but they handle not : feet have they , but they walk not : neither speak they through their throat .
they that make them are like unto them ; so is every one that trusteth in them .
and his host , and those that were numbered of them , were forty thousand and five hundred .
wherefore tongues are for a sign , not to them that believe , but to them that believe not : but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not , but for them which believe .
then the tabernacle of the congregation shall set forward with the camp of the levites in the midst of the camp : as they encamp , so shall they set forward , every man in his place by their standards .
on the west side shall be the standard of the camp of ephraim according to their armies : and the captain of the sons of ephraim shall be elishama the son of ammihud .
brethren , be not children in understanding : howbeit in malice be ye children , but in understanding be men .
and his host , and those that were numbered of them , were forty and five thousand and six hundred and fifty .
in the law it is written , with men of other tongues and other lips will i speak unto this people ; and yet for all that will they not hear me , saith the lord .
all that were numbered in the camp of reuben were an hundred thousand and fifty and one thousand and four hundred and fifty , throughout their armies . and they shall set forth in the second rank .
then the tribe of gad : and the captain of the sons of gad shall be eliasaph the son of reuel .
and his host , and those that were numbered thereof , were forty and six thousand and five hundred .
and those which pitch by him shall be the tribe of simeon : and the captain of the children of simeon shall be shelumiel the son of zurishaddai .
wherefore , brethren , covet to prophesy , and forbid not to speak with tongues .
what ? came the word of god out from you ? or came it unto you only ?
and if they will learn any thing , let them ask their husbands at home : for it is a shame for women to speak in the church .
but if any man be ignorant , let him be ignorant .
if any man think himself to be a prophet , or spiritual , let him acknowledge that the things that i write unto you are the commandments of the lord .
i was at ease , but he hath broken me asunder : he hath also taken me by my neck , and shaken me to pieces , and set me up for his mark .
god hath delivered me to the ungodly , and turned me over into the hands of the wicked .
he breaketh me with breach upon breach , he runneth upon me like a giant .
his archers compass me round about , he cleaveth my reins asunder , and doth not spare ; he poureth out my gall upon the ground .
they have gaped upon me with their mouth ; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully ; they have gathered themselves together against me .
i have sewed sackcloth upon my skin , and defiled my horn in the dust .
my face is foul with weeping , and my eyelids is the shadow of death ;
not for any injustice in mine hands : also my prayer is pure .
o earth , cover not thou my blood , and let my cry have no place .
for ye may all prophesy one by one , that all may learn , and all may be comforted .
and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets .
let your women keep silence in the churches : for it is not permitted unto them to speak ; but they are commanded to be under obedience , as also saith the law .
if any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by , let the first hold his peace .
and i will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked , and i will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible .
and i will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall : and they shall fight against thee , but they shall not prevail against thee : for i am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee , saith the lord .
let all things be done decently and in order .
examine me , o lord , and prove me ; try my reins and my heart .
my soul is among lions : and i lie even among them that are set on fire , even the sons of men , whose teeth are spears and arrows , and their tongue a sharp sword .
for thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes : and i have walked in thy truth .
be thou exalted , o god , above the heavens ; let thy glory be above all the earth .
i have not sat with vain persons , neither will i go in with dissemblers .
they have prepared a net for my steps ; my soul is bowed down : they have digged a pit before me , into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves . selah .
i have hated the congregation of evil doers ; and will not sit with the wicked .
my heart is fixed , o god , my heart is fixed : i will sing and give praise .
be merciful unto me , o god , be merciful unto me : for my soul trusteth in thee : yea , in the shadow of thy wings will i make my refuge , until these calamities be overpast .
i will cry unto god most high ; unto god that performeth all things for me .
judge me , o lord ; for i have walked in mine integrity : i have trusted also in the lord ; therefore i shall not slide .
he shall send from heaven , and save from the reproach of him that would swallow me up . selah . god shall send forth his mercy and his truth .
i will wash mine hands in innocency : so will i compass thine altar , o lord :
awake up , my glory ; awake , psaltery and harp : i myself will awake early .
that i may publish with the voice of thanksgiving , and tell of all thy wondrous works .
i will praise thee , o lord , among the people : i will sing unto thee among the nations .
lord , i have loved the habitation of thy house , and the place where thine honour dwelleth .
gather not my soul with sinners , nor my life with bloody men :
their idols are silver and gold , the work of men ' s hands .
but our god is in the heavens : he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased .
wherefore should the heathen say , where is now their god ?
not unto us , o lord , not unto us , but unto thy name give glory , for thy mercy , and for thy truth ' s sake .
his sons , and his sons ' sons with him , his daughters , and his sons ' daughters , and all his seed brought he with him into egypt .
and they took their cattle , and their goods , which they had gotten in the land of canaan , and came into egypt , jacob , and all his seed with him :
and the sons of reuben ; hanoch , and phallu , and hezron , and carmi .
and these are the names of the children of israel , which came into egypt , jacob and his sons : reuben , jacob ' s firstborn .
and he said , i am god , the god of thy father : fear not to go down into egypt ; for i will there make of thee a great nation :
and god spake unto israel in the visions of the night , and said , jacob , jacob . and he said , here am i .
and jacob rose up from beer - sheba : and the sons of israel carried jacob their father , and their little ones , and their wives , in the wagons which pharaoh had sent to carry him .
i will go down with thee into egypt ; and i will also surely bring thee up again : and joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes .
and david said , what have i now done ? is there not a cause ?
and david spake to the men that stood by him , saying , what shall be done to the man that killeth this philistine , and taketh away the reproach from israel ? for who is this uncircumcised philistine , that he should defy the armies of the living god ?
and the people answered him after this manner , saying , so shall it be done to the man that killeth him .
which was the son of joanna , which was the son of rhesa , which was the son of zorobabel , which was the son of salathiel , which was the son of neri ,
and david left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage , and ran into the army , and came and saluted his brethren .
which was the son of melchi , which was the son of addi , which was the son of cosam , which was the son of elmodam , which was the son of er ,
for israel and the philistines had put the battle in array , army against army .
which was the son of jose , which was the son of eliezer , which was the son of jorim , which was the son of matthat , which was the son of levi ,
and all the men of israel , when they saw the man , fled from him , and were sore afraid .
and as he talked with them , behold , there came up the champion , the philistine of gath , goliath by name , out of the armies of the philistines , and spake according to the same words : and david heard them .
and david rose up early in the morning , and left the sheep with a keeper , and took , and went , as jesse had commanded him ; and he came to the trench , as the host was going forth to the fight , and shouted for the battle .
and the children of gad dwelt over against them , in the land of bashan unto salchah :
for the lord is our judge , the lord is our lawgiver , the lord is our king ; he will save us .
added yet this above all , that he shut up john in prison .
and in the days of saul they made war with the hagarites , who fell by their hand : and they dwelt in their tents throughout all the east land of gilead .
but there the glorious lord will be unto us a place of broad rivers and streams ; wherein shall go no galley with oars , neither shall gallant ship pass thereby .
now when all the people were baptized , it came to pass , that jesus also being baptized , and praying , the heaven was opened ,
and their brethren of the house of their fathers were , michael , and meshullam , and sheba , and jorai , and jachan , and zia , and heber , seven .
look upon zion , the city of our solemnities : thine eyes shall see jerusalem a quiet habitation , a tabernacle that shall not be taken down ; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed , neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken .
and the holy ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him , and a voice came from heaven , which said , thou art my beloved son ; in thee i am well pleased .
joel the chief , and shapham the next , and jaanai , and shaphat in bashan .
and israel took his journey with all that he had , and came to beer - sheba , and offered sacrifices unto the god of his father isaac .
do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world ? and if the world shall be judged by you , are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters ?
and jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age , being ( as was supposed ) the son of joseph , which was the son of heli ,
dare any of you , having a matter against another , go to law before the unjust , and not before the saints ?
if then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life , set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church .
which was the son of mattathias , which was the son of amos , which was the son of naum , which was the son of esli , which was the son of nagge ,
and the inhabitant shall not say , i am sick : the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity .
which was the son of maath , which was the son of mattathias , which was the son of semei , which was the son of joseph , which was the son of juda ,
thy tacklings are loosed ; they could not well strengthen their mast , they could not spread the sail : then is the prey of a great spoil divided ; the lame take the prey .
now therefore there is utterly a fault among you , because ye go to law one with another . why do ye not rather take wrong ? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded ?
for so it was , that the children of israel had sinned against the lord their god , which had brought them up out of the land of egypt , from under the hand of pharoah king of egypt , and had feared other gods ,
and all israel heard say that saul had smitten a garrison of the philistines , and that israel also was had in abomination with the philistines . and the people were called together after saul to gilgal .
he shall dwell on high : his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks : bread shall be given him ; his waters shall be sure .
nay , ye do wrong , and defraud , and that your brethren .
in the ninth year of hoshea the king of assyria took samaria , and carried israel away into assyria , and placed them in halah and in habor by the river of gozan , and in the cities of the medes .
and jonathan smote the garrison of the philistines that was in geba , and the philistines heard of it . and saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land , saying , let the hebrews hear .
thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty : they shall behold the land that is very far off .
i speak to your shame . is it so , that there is not a wise man among you ? no , not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren ?
the sons of reuben , and the gadites , and half the tribe of manasseh , of valiant men , men able to bear buckler and sword , and to shoot with bow , and skilful in war , were four and forty thousand seven hundred and threescore , that went out to the war .
and the children of israel did secretly those things that were not right against the lord their god , and they built them high places in all their cities , from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city .
saul chose him three thousand men of israel ; whereof two thousand were with saul in michmash and in mount bethel , and a thousand were with jonathan in gibeah of benjamin : and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent .
thine heart shall meditate terror . where is the scribe ? where is the receiver ? where is he that counted the towers ?
and they made war with the hagarites , with jetur , and nephish , and nodab .
and walked in the statutes of the heathen , whom the lord cast out from before the children of israel , and of the kings of israel , which they had made .
saul reigned one year ; and when he had reigned two years over israel ,
thou shalt not see a fierce people , a people of a deeper speech than thou canst perceive ; of a stammering tongue , that thou canst not understand .
and they dwelt in gilead in bashan , and in her towns , and in all the suburbs of sharon , upon their borders .
and he tarried seven days , according to the set time that samuel had appointed : but samuel came not to gilgal ; and the people were scattered from him .
all these were reckoned by genealogies in the days of jotham king of judah , and in the days of jeroboam king of israel .
and some of the hebrews went over jordan to the land of gad and gilead . as for saul , he was yet in gilgal , and all the people followed him trembling .
know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god ? be not deceived : neither fornicators , nor idolaters , nor adulterers , nor effeminate , nor abusers of themselves with mankind ,
these are the children of abihail the son of huri , the son of jaroah , the son of gilead , the son of michael , the son of jeshishai , the son of jahdo , the son of buz ;
when the men of israel saw that they were in a strait , ( for the people were distressed , ) then the people did hide themselves in caves , and in thickets , and in rocks , and in high places , and in pits .
ahi the son of abdiel , the son of guni , chief of the house of their fathers .
and the philistines gathered themselves together to fight with israel , thirty thousand chariots , and six thousand horsemen , and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude : and they came up , and pitched in michmash , eastward from beth - aven .
in the twelfth year of ahaz king of judah began hoshea the son of elah to reign in samaria over israel nine years .
and saul said , bring hither a burnt offering to me , and peace offerings . and he offered the burnt offering .
against him came up shalmaneser king of assyria ; and hoshea became his servant , and gave him presents .
and saul armed david with his armour , and he put an helmet of brass upon his head ; also he armed him with a coat of mail .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord , but not as the kings of israel that were before him .
and david girded his sword upon his armour , and he assayed to go ; for he had not proved it . and david said unto saul , i cannot go with these ; for i have not proved them . and david put them off him .
then the king of assyria came up throughout all the land , and went up to samaria , and besieged it three years .
thy servant slew both the lion and the bear : and this uncircumcised philistine shall be as one of them , seeing he hath defied the armies of the living god .
and the king of assyria found conspiracy in hoshea : for he had sent messengers to so king of egypt , and brought no present to the king of assyria , as he had done year by year : therefore the king of assyria shut him up , and bound him in prison .
david said moreover , the lord that delivered me out of the paw of the lion , and out of the paw of the bear , he will deliver me out of the hand of this philistine . and saul said unto david , go , and the lord be with thee .
and many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people .
and i went out after him , and smote him , and delivered it out of his mouth : and when he arose against me , i caught him by his beard , and smote him , and slew him .
but herod the tetrarch , being reproved by him for herodias his brother philip ' s wife , and for all the evils which herod had done ,
and david said unto saul , thy servant kept his father ' s sheep , and there came a lion , and a bear , and took a lamb out of the flock :
john answered , saying unto them all , i indeed baptize you with water ; but one mightier than i cometh , the latchet of whose shoes i am not worthy to unloose : he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire :
and saul said to david , thou art not able to go against this philistine to fight with him : for thou art but a youth , and he a man of war from his youth .
whose fan is in his hand , and he will throughly purge his floor , and will gather the wheat into his garner ; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable .
and david said to saul , let no man ' s heart fail because of him ; thy servant will go and fight with this philistine .
and when the words were heard which david spake , they rehearsed them before saul : and he sent for him .
and he turned from him toward another , and spake after the same manner : and the people answered him again after the former manner .
and the people asked him , saying , what shall we do then ?
and these were the heads of the house of their fathers , even epher , and ishi , and eliel , and azriel , and jeremiah , and hodaviah , and jahdiel , mighty men of valour , famous men , and heads of the house of their fathers .
he answereth and saith unto them , he that hath two coats , let him impart to him that hath none ; and he that hath meat , let him do likewise .
and the children of the half tribe of manasseh dwelt in the land : they increased from bashan unto baal - hermon and senir , and unto mount hermon .
for there fell down many slain , because the war was of god . and they dwelt in their steads until the captivity .
ye shall conceive chaff , ye shall bring forth stubble : your breath , as fire , shall devour you .
and they took away their cattle ; of their camels fifty thousand , and of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand , and of asses two thousand , and of men an hundred thousand .
now will i rise , saith the lord ; now will i be exalted ; now will i lift up myself .
and the soldiers likewise demanded of him , saying , and what shall we do ? and he said unto them , do violence to no man , neither accuse any falsely ; and be content with your wages .
and they were helped against them , and the hagarites were delivered into their hand , and all that were with them : for they cried to god in the battle , and he was intreated of them ; because they put their trust in him .
hear , ye that are far off , what i have done ; and , ye that are near , acknowledge my might .
and as the people were in expectation , and all men mused in their hearts of john , whether he were the christ , or not ;
and the people shall be as the burnings of lime : as thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire .
then came also publicans to be baptized , and said unto him , master , what shall we do ?
and he said unto them , exact no more than that which is appointed you .
the sinners in zion are afraid ; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites . who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire ? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings ?
and they transgressed against the god of their fathers , and went a whoring after the gods of the people of the land , whom god destroyed before them .
and the children of israel did according to all that the lord commanded moses : so they pitched by their standards , and so they set forward , every one after their families , according to the house of their fathers .
but the levites were not numbered among the children of israel ; as the lord commanded moses .
and all this assembly shall know that the lord saveth not with sword and spear : for the battle is the lord ' s , and he will give you into our hands .
and it came to pass , when the philistine arose , and came and drew nigh to meet david , that david hasted , and ran toward the army to meet the philistine .
and david put his hand in his bag , and took thence a stone , and slang it , and smote the philistine in his forehead , that the stone sunk into his forehead ; and he fell upon his face to the earth .
and he took his staff in his hand , and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook , and put them in a shepherd ' s bag which he had , even in a scrip ; and his sling was in his hand : and he drew near to the philistine .
and when the philistine looked about , and saw david , he disdained him : for he was but a youth , and ruddy , and of a fair countenance .
and the philistine came on and drew near unto david ; and the man that bare the shield went before him .
and the philistine said to david , come to me , and i will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air , and to the beasts of the field .
and the philistine said unto david , am i a dog , that thou comest to me with staves ? and the philistine cursed david by his gods .
then said david to the philistine , thou comest to me with a sword , and with a spear , and with a shield : but i come to thee in the name of the lord of hosts , the god of the armies of israel , whom thou hast defied .
and his host , and those that were numbered of them , were fifty and three thousand and four hundred .
all they that were numbered in the camp of dan were an hundred thousand and fifty and seven thousand and six hundred . they shall go hindmost with their standards .
these are those which were numbered of the children of israel by the house of their fathers : all those that were numbered of the camps throughout their hosts were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty .
all that were numbered of the camp of ephraim were an hundred thousand and eight thousand and an hundred , throughout their armies . and they shall go forward in the third rank .
and his host , and those that were numbered of them , were thirty and five thousand and four hundred .
then the tribe of benjamin : and the captain of the sons of benjamin shall be abidan the son of gideoni .
then the tribe of naphtali : and the captain of the children of naphtali shall be ahira the son of enan .
and his host , and those that were numbered of them , were forty and one thousand and five hundred .
and those that encamp by him shall be the tribe of asher : and the captain of the children of asher shall be pagiel the son of ocran .
and his host , and those that were numbered of them , were threescore and two thousand and seven hundred .
and saul said to him , whose son art thou , thou young man ? and david answered , i am the son of thy servant jesse the bethlehemite .
and the children of israel returned from chasing after the philistines , and they spoiled their tents .
and the men of israel and of judah arose , and shouted , and pursued the philistines , until thou come to the valley , and to the gates of ekron . and the wounded of the philistines fell down by the way to shaaraim , even unto gath , and unto ekron .
therefore david ran , and stood upon the philistine , and took his sword , and drew it out of the sheath thereof , and slew him , and cut off his head therewith . and when the philistines saw their champion was dead , they fled .
so david prevailed over the philistine with a sling and with a stone , and smote the philistine , and slew him ; but there was no sword in the hand of david .
and as david returned from the slaughter of the philistine , abner took him , and brought him before saul with the head of the philistine in his hand .
and the king said , inquire thou whose son the stripling is .
and when saul saw david go forth against the philistine , he said unto abner , the captain of the host , abner , whose son is this youth ? and abner said , as thy soul liveth , o king , i cannot tell .
and david took the head of the philistine , and brought it to jerusalem ; but he put his armour in his tent .
and by him shall be the tribe of manasseh : and the captain of the children of manasseh shall be gamaliel the son of pedahzur .
and his host , and those that were numbered of them , were thirty and two thousand and two hundred .
so again have i thought in these days to do well unto jerusalem and to the house of judah : fear ye not .
these are the things that ye shall do ; speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour ; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates :
and let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour ; and love no false oath : for all these are things that i hate , saith the lord .
and the word of the lord of hosts came unto me , saying ,
submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of god .
but now i will not be unto the residue of this people as in the former days , saith the lord of hosts .
giving thanks always for all things unto god and the father in the name of our lord jesus christ ;
for the seed shall be prosperous ; the vine shall give her fruit , and the ground shall give her increase , and the heavens shall give their dew ; and i will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things .
for the husband is the head of the wife , even as christ is the head of the church : and he is the saviour of the body .
vanity of vanities , saith the preacher ; all is vanity .
and it shall come to pass , that as ye were a curse among the heathen , o house of judah , and house of israel ; so will i save you , and ye shall be a blessing : fear not , but let your hands be strong .
wives , submit yourselves unto your own husbands , as unto the lord .
and moreover , because the preacher was wise , he still taught the people knowledge ; yea , he gave good heed , and sought out , and set in order many proverbs .
for thus saith the lord of hosts ; as i thought to punish you , when your fathers provoked me to wrath , saith the lord of hosts , and i repented not :
husbands , love your wives , even as christ also loved the church , and gave himself for it ;
and they did eat and drink , he and the men that were with him , and tarried all night ; and they rose up in the morning , and he said , send me away unto my master .
and why dost thou not pardon my transgression , and take away mine iniquity ? for now shall i sleep in the dust ; and thou shalt seek me in the morning , but i shall not be .
therefore as the church is subject unto christ , so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing .
and the servant brought forth jewels of silver , and jewels of gold , and raiment , and gave them to rebekah : he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things .
i have sinned ; what shall i do unto thee , o thou preserver of men ? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee , so that i am a burden to myself ?
that he might present it to himself a glorious church , not having spot , or wrinkle , or any such thing ; but that it should be holy and without blemish .
and he said unto them , hinder me not , seeing the lord hath prospered my way ; send me away that i may go to my master .
and her brother and her mother said , let the damsel abide with us a few days , at the least ten ; after that she shall go .
for before these days there was no hire for man , nor any hire for beast ; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction : for i set all men every one against his neighbour .
for no man ever yet hated his own flesh ; but nourisheth and cherisheth it , even as the lord the church :
so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies . he that loveth his wife loveth himself .
and they said , we will call the damsel , and inquire at her mouth .
and they sent away rebekah their sister , and her nurse , and abraham ' s servant , and his men .
and they blessed rebekah , and said unto her , thou art our sister , be thou the mother of thousands of millions , and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them .
and rebekah arose , and her damsels , and they rode upon the camels , and followed the man : and the servant took rebekah , and went his way .
and isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide : and he lifted up his eyes , and saw , and , behold , the camels were coming .
and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness , but rather reprove them .
proving what is acceptable unto the lord .
yea , many people and strong nations shall come to seek the lord of hosts in jerusalem , and to pray before the lord .
redeeming the time , because the days are evil .
and isaac brought her into his mother sarah ' s tent , and took rebekah , and she became his wife ; and he loved her : and isaac was comforted after his mother ' s death .
see then that ye walk circumspectly , not as fools , but as wise ,
and the servant told isaac all things that he had done .
and the inhabitants of one city shall go to another , saying , let us go speedily to pray before the lord , and to seek the lord of hosts : i will go also .
wherefore he saith , awake thou that sleepest , and arise from the dead , and christ shall give thee light .
for she had said unto the servant , what man is this that walketh in the field to meet us ? and the servant had said , it is my master : therefore she took a vail , and covered herself .
but all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light : for whatsoever doth make manifest is light .
and rebekah lifted up her eyes , and when she saw isaac , she lighted off the camel .
speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , singing and making melody in your heart to the lord ;
and be not drunk with wine , wherein is excess ; but be filled with the spirit ;
wherefore be ye not unwise , but understanding what the will of the lord is .
which was the son of mathusala , which was the son of enoch , which was the son of jared , which was the son of maleleel , which was the son of cainan ,
which was the son of cainan , which was the son of arphaxad , which was the son of sem , which was the son of noe , which was the son of lamech ,
which was the son of saruch , which was the son of ragau , which was the son of phalec , which was the son of heber , which was the son of sala ,

which was the son of aminadab , which was the son of aram , which was the son of esrom , which was the son of phares , which was the son of juda ,

also when they shall be afraid of that which is high , and fears shall be in the way , and the almond tree shall flourish , and the grasshopper shall be a burden , and desire shall fail : because man goeth to his long home , and the mourners go about the streets :
and the doors shall be shut in the streets , when the sound of the grinding is low , and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird , and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low ;
then shall the dust return to the earth as it was : and the spirit shall return unto god who gave it .
or ever the silver cord be loosed , or the golden bowl be broken , or the pitcher be broken at the fountain , or the wheel broken at the cistern .
remember now thy creator in the days of thy youth , while the evil days come not , nor the years draw nigh , when thou shalt say , i have no pleasure in them ;
in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble , and the strong men shall bow themselves , and the grinders cease because they are few , and those that look out of the windows be darkened ,
which was the son of enos , which was the son of seth , which was the son of adam , which was the son of god .
while the sun , or the light , or the moon , or the stars , be not darkened , nor the clouds return after the rain :
thus saith the lord of hosts ; the fast of the fourth month , and the fast of the fifth , and the fast of the seventh , and the fast of the tenth , shall be to the house of judah joy and gladness , and cheerful feasts ; therefore love the truth and peace .
now saul , and they , and all the men of israel , were in the valley of elah , fighting with the philistines .
and carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand , and look how thy brethren fare , and take their pledge .
but david went and returned from saul to feed his father ' s sheep at bethlehem .
and david was the youngest : and the three eldest followed saul .
and jesse said unto david his son , take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn , and these ten loaves , and run to the camp to thy brethren ;
and the philistine drew near morning and evening , and presented himself forty days .
and the philistine said , i defy the armies of israel this day ; give me a man , that we may fight together .
when saul and all israel heard those words of the philistine , they were dismayed , and greatly afraid .
now david was the son of that ephrathite of bethlehemjudah , whose name was jesse ; and he had eight sons : and the man went among men for an old man in the days of saul .
and the three eldest sons of jesse went and followed saul to the battle : and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were eliab the firstborn , and next unto him abinadab , and the third shammah .
give her of the fruit of her hands ; and let her own works praise her in the gates .
who can find a virtuous woman ? for her price is far above rubies .
the heart of her husband doth safely trust in her , so that he shall have no need of spoil .
and this i say , lest any man should beguile you with enticing words .
she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life .
for though i be absent in the flesh , yet am i with you in the spirit , joying and beholding your order , and the stedfastness of your faith in christ .
she seeketh wool , and flax , and worketh willingly with her hands .
that their hearts might be comforted , being knit together in love , and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding , to the acknowledgement of the mystery of god , and of the father , and of christ ;
she is like the merchants ' ships ; she bringeth her food from afar .
in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge .
she riseth also while it is yet night , and giveth meat to her household , and a portion to her maidens .
she perceiveth that her merchandise is good : her candle goeth not out by night .
she layeth her hands to the spindle , and her hands hold the distaff .
rooted and built up in him , and stablished in the faith , as ye have been taught , abounding therein with thanksgiving .
as ye have therefore received christ jesus the lord , so walk ye in him :
for in him dwelleth all the fulness of the godhead bodily .
beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit , after the tradition of men , after the rudiments of the world , and not after christ .
and all the elders of israel came ; and the levites took up the ark .
and this shall be an everlasting statute unto you , to make an atonement for the children of israel for all their sins once a year . and he did as the lord commanded moses .
she is not afraid of the snow for her household : for all her household are clothed with scarlet .
and they brought up the ark , and the tabernacle of the congregation , and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle , these did the priests and the levites bring up .
and he shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary , and he shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the congregation , and for the altar , and he shall make an atonement for the priests , and for all the people of the congregation .
she maketh herself coverings of tapestry ; her clothing is silk and purple .
also king solomon , and all the congregation of israel that were assembled unto him before the ark , sacrificed sheep and oxen , which could not be told nor numbered for multitude .
and the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the lord unto his place , to the oracle of the house , into the most holy place , even under the wings of the cherubims :
she stretcheth out her hand to the poor ; yea , she reacheth forth her hands to the needy .
for the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of the ark , and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above .
for on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you , to cleanse you , that ye may be clean from all your sins before the lord .
strength and honour are her clothing ; and she shall rejoice in time to come .
and they drew out the staves of the ark , that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle ; but they were not seen without . and there it is unto this day .
she openeth her mouth with wisdom ; and in her tongue is the law of kindness .
and the priest , whom he shall anoint , and whom he shall consecrate to minister in the priest ' s office in his father ' s stead , shall make the atonement , and shall put on the linen clothes , even the holy garments :
her husband is known in the gates , when he sitteth among the elders of the land .
it shall be a sabbath of rest unto you , and ye shall afflict your souls , by a statute for ever .
she maketh fine linen , and selleth it ; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant .
many daughters have done virtuously , but thou excellest them all .
she looketh well to the ways of her household , and eateth not the bread of idleness .
her children arise up , and call her blessed ; her husband also , and he praiseth her .
thus all the work that solomon made for the house of the lord was finished : and solomon brought in all the things that david his father had dedicated ; and the silver , and the gold , and all the instruments , put he among the treasures of the house of god .
then solomon assembled the elders of israel , and all the heads of the tribes , the chief of the fathers of the children of israel , unto jerusalem , to bring up the ark of the covenant of the lord out of the city of david , which is zion .
wherefore all the men of israel assembled themselves unto the king in the feast which was in the seventh month .
lest the lord see it , and it displease him , and he turn away his wrath from him .
fret not thyself because of evil men , neither be thou envious at the wicked ;
wherefore we labour , that , whether present or absent , we may be accepted of him .
and huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships , and servants that had knowledge of the sea ; and they went with the servants of solomon to ophir , and took thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold , and brought them to king solomon .
for a just man falleth seven times , and riseth up again : but the wicked shall fall into mischief .
rejoice not when thine enemy falleth , and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth :
( for we walk by faith , not by sight : )
so shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul : when thou hast found it , then there shall be a reward , and thy expectation shall not be cut off .
we are confident , i say , and willing rather to be absent from the body , and to be present with the lord .
lay not wait , o wicked man , against the dwelling of the righteous ; spoil not his resting place :
now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is god , who also hath given unto us the earnest of the spirit .
if thou sayest , behold , we knew it not ; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it ? and he that keepeth thy soul , doth not he know it ? and shall not he render to every man according to his works ?
therefore we are always confident , knowing that , whilst we are at home in the body , we are absent from the lord :
my son , eat thou honey , because it is good ; and the honeycomb , which is sweet to thy taste :
for their calamity shall rise suddenly ; and who knoweth the ruin of them both ?
my son , fear thou the lord and the king : and meddle not with them that are given to change :
for there shall be no reward to the evil man ; the candle of the wicked shall be put out .
for in this we groan , earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven :
and solomon brought up the daughter of pharaoh out of the city of david unto the house that he had built for her : for he said , my wife shall not dwell in the house of david king of israel , because the places are holy , whereunto the ark of the lord hath come .
for we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved , we have a building of god , an house not made with hands , eternal in the heavens .
and these were the chief of king solomon ' s officers , even two hundred and fifty , that bare rule over the people .
for we that are in this tabernacle do groan , being burdened : not for that we would be unclothed , but clothed upon , that mortality might be swallowed up of life .
even after a certain rate every day , offering according to the commandment of moses , on the sabbaths , and on the new moons , and on the solemn feasts , three times in the year , even in the feast of unleavened bread , and in the feast of weeks , and in the feast of tabernacles .
if thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death , and those that are ready to be slain ;
if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked .
then solomon offered burnt offerings unto the lord on the altar of the lord , which he had built before the porch ,
if thou faint in the day of adversity , thy strength is small .
and they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and levites concerning any matter , or concerning the treasures .
now all the work of solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of the lord , and until it was finished . so the house of the lord was perfected .
so shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth ; and thy want as an armed man .
every man praying or prophesying , having his head covered , dishonoureth his head .
but i would have you know , that the head of every man is christ ; and the head of the woman is the man ; and the head of christ is god .
now i praise you , brethren , that ye remember me in all things , and keep the ordinances , as i delivered them to you .
be ye followers of me , even as i also am of christ .
for the man is not of the woman ; but the woman of the man .
for a man indeed ought not to cover his head , forasmuch as he is the image and glory of god : but the woman is the glory of the man .
for if the woman be not covered , let her also be shorn : but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven , let her be covered .
but every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head : for that is even all one as if she were shaven .
these things also belong to the wise . it is not good to have respect of persons in judgment .
he that saith unto the wicked , thou are righteous ; him shall the people curse , nations shall abhor him :
neither was the man created for the woman ; but the woman for the man .
every man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answer .
prepare thy work without , and make it fit for thyself in the field ; and afterwards build thine house .
be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause ; and deceive not with thy lips .
say not , i will do so to him as he hath done to me : i will render to the man according to his work .
and , lo , it was all grown over with thorns , and nettles had covered the face thereof , and the stone wall thereof was broken down .
i went by the field of the slothful , and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding ;
yet a little sleep , a little slumber , a little folding of the hands to sleep :
then i saw , and considered it well : i looked upon it , and received instruction .
now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of israel were assembled with fasting , and with sackclothes , and earth upon them .
then stood up upon the stairs , of the levites , jeshua , and bani , kadmiel , shebaniah , bunni , sherebiah , bani , and chenani , and cried with a loud voice unto the lord their god .
then the levites , jeshua , and kadmiel , bani , hashabniah , sherebiah , hodijah , shebaniah , and pethahiah , said , stand up and bless the lord your god for ever and ever : and blessed be thy glorious name , which is exalted above all blessing and praise .
and the seed of israel separated themselves from all strangers , and stood and confessed their sins , and the iniquities of their fathers .
and they stood up in their place , and read in the book of the law of the lord their god one fourth part of the day ; and another fourth part they confessed , and worshipped the lord their god .
and didst see the affliction of our fathers in egypt , and heardest their cry by the red sea ;
thou , even thou , art lord alone ; thou hast made heaven , the heaven of heavens , with all their host , the earth , and all things that are therein , the seas , and all that is therein , and thou preservest them all ; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee .
thou art the lord the god , who didst choose abram , and broughtest him forth out of ur of the chaldees , and gavest him the name of abraham ;
yet within three days shall pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee , and shall hang thee on a tree ; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee .
the same was in the beginning with god .
all things were made by him ; and without him was not any thing made that was made .
in the beginning was the word , and the word was with god , and the word was god .
and in the vine were three branches : and it was as though it budded , and her blossoms shot forth ; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes :
and joseph said unto him , this is the interpretation of it : the three branches are three days :
and pharaoh ' s cup was in my hand : and i took the grapes , and pressed them into pharaoh ' s cup , and i gave the cup into pharaoh ' s hand .
but think on me when it shall be well with thee , and shew kindness , i pray thee , unto me , and make mention of me unto pharaoh , and bring me out of this house :
yet within three days shall pharaoh lift up thine head , and restore thee unto thy place : and thou shalt deliver pharaoh ' s cup into his hand , after the former manner when thou wast his butler .
when the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good , he said unto joseph , i also was in my dream , and , behold , i had three white baskets on my head :
for indeed i was stolen away out of the land of the hebrews : and here also have i done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon .
and joseph answered and said , this is the interpretation thereof : the three baskets are three days :
and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for pharaoh ; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head .
that was the true light , which lighteth every man that cometh into the world .
he was not that light , but was sent to bear witness of that light .
and the light shineth in darkness ; and the darkness comprehended it not .
and he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again ; and he gave the cup into pharaoh ' s hand :
in him was life ; and the life was the light of men .
and it came to pass the third day , which was pharaoh ' s birthday , that he made a feast unto all his servants : and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants .
there was a man sent from god , whose name was john .
yet did not the chief butler remember joseph , but forgat him .
but he hanged the chief baker : as joseph had interpreted to them .
for yourselves , brethren , know our entrance in unto you , that it was not in vain :
but even after that we had suffered before , and were shamefully entreated , as ye know , at philippi , we were bold in our god to speak unto you the gospel of god with much contention .
for our exhortation was not of deceit , nor of uncleanness , nor in guile :
but as we were allowed of god to be put in trust with the gospel , even so we speak ; not as pleasing men , but god , which trieth our hearts .
for neither at any time used we flattering words , as ye know , nor a cloke of covetousness ; god is witness :
and hatach came and told esther the words of mordecai .
nor of men sought we glory , neither of you , nor yet of others , when we might have been burdensome , as the apostles of christ .
but we were gentle among you , even as a nurse cherisheth her children :
and mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him , and of the sum of the money that haman had promised to pay to the king ' s treasuries for the jews , to destroy them .
so hatach went forth to mordecai unto the street of the city , which was before the king ' s gate .
for ye remember , brethren , our labour and travail : for labouring night and day , because we would not be chargeable unto any of you , we preached unto you the gospel of god .
then called esther for hatach , one of the king ' s chamberlains , whom he had appointed to attend upon her , and gave him a commandment to mordecai , to know what it was , and why it was .
so esther ' s maids and her chamberlains came and told it her . then was the queen exceedingly grieved ; and she sent raiment to clothe mordecai , and to take away his sackcloth from him : but he received it not .
and when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place , and the tabernacle of the congregation , and the altar , he shall bring the live goat :
and in every province , whithersoever the king ' s commandment and his decree came , there was great mourning among the jews , and fasting , and weeping , and wailing ; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes .
and came even before the king ' s gate : for none might enter into the king ' s gate clothed with sackcloth .
and the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited : and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness .
when mordecai perceived all that was done , mordecai rent his clothes , and put on sackcloth with ashes , and went out into the midst of the city , and cried with a loud and a bitter cry ;
and aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation , and shall put off the linen garments , which he put on when he went into the holy place , and shall leave them there :
and he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place , and put on his garments , and come forth , and offer his burnt offering , and the burnt offering of the people , and make an atonement for himself , and for the people .
and the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar .
and the bullock for the sin offering , and the goat for the sin offering , whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place , shall one carry forth without the camp ; and they shall burn in the fire their skins , and their flesh , and their dung .
and he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his clothes , and bathe his flesh in water , and afterward come into the camp .
and this shall be a statute for ever unto you : that in the seventh month , on the tenth day of the month , ye shall afflict your souls , and do no work at all , whether it be one of your own country , or a stranger that sojourneth among you :
and he that burneth them shall wash his clothes , and bathe his flesh in water , and afterward he shall come into the camp .
o give thanks unto the lord ; for he is good : for his mercy endureth for ever .
thou art my god , and i will praise thee : thou art my god , i will exalt thee .
blessed be he that cometh in the name of the lord : we have blessed you out of the house of the lord .
save now , i beseech thee , o lord : o lord , i beseech thee , send now prosperity .
this is the day which the lord hath made ; we will rejoice and be glad in it .
this is the lord ' s doing ; it is marvellous in our eyes .
the stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner .
i will praise thee : for thou hast heard me , and art become my salvation .
this gate of the lord , into which the righteous shall enter .
and he shall take of the blood of the bullock , and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward ; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times .
and aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering , which is for himself , and shall make an atonement for himself , and for his house , and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself :
and he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the lord , and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small , and bring it within the vail :
and he shall go out unto the altar that is before the lord , and make an atonement for it ; and shall take of the blood of the bullock , and of the blood of the goat , and put it upon the horns of the altar round about .
and there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place , until he come out , and have made an atonement for himself , and for his household , and for all the congregation of israel .
and he shall make an atonement for the holy place , because of the uncleanness of the children of israel , and because of their transgressions in all their sins : and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation , that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness .
i shall not die , but live , and declare the works of the lord .
and he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times , and cleanse it , and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of israel .
open to me the gates of righteousness : i will go into them , and i will praise the lord :
the lord is my strength and song , and is become my salvation .
thou hast thrust sore at me that i might fall : but the lord helped me .
the right hand of the lord is exalted : the right hand of the lord doeth valiantly .
the voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous : the right hand of the lord doeth valiantly .
all nations compassed me about : but in the name of the lord will i destroy them .
they compassed me about like bees ; they are quenched as the fire of thorns : for in the name of the lord i will destroy them .
they compassed me about ; yea , they compassed me about : but in the name of the lord i will destroy them .
and her two sons ; of which the name of the one was gershom ; for he said , i have been an alien in a strange land :
and the name of the other was eliezer ; for the god of my father , said he , was mine help , and delivered me from the sword of pharaoh :
when jethro , the priest of midian , moses ' father in law , heard of all that god had done for moses , and for israel his people , and that the lord had brought israel out of egypt ;
then jethro , moses ' father in law , took zipporah , moses ' wife , after he had sent her back ,
and moses went out to meet his father in law , and did obeisance , and kissed him ; and they asked each other of their welfare ; and they came into the tent .
and moses told his father in law all that the lord had done unto pharaoh and to the egyptians for israel ' s sake , and all the travail that had come upon them by the way , and how the lord delivered them .
and jethro , moses ' father in law , came with his sons and his wife unto moses into the wilderness , where he encamped at the mount of god :
and he said unto moses , i thy father in law jethro am come unto thee , and thy wife , and her two sons with her .
and jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the lord had done to israel , whom he had delivered out of the hand of the egyptians .
and i will establish my covenant with you ; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood ; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth .
and with every living creature that is with you , of the fowl , of the cattle , and of every beast of the earth with you ; from all that go out of the ark , to every beast of the earth .
then joab arose , and came to absalom unto his house , and said unto him , wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire ?
therefore he said unto his servants , see , joab ' s field is near mine , and he hath barley there ; go and set it on fire . and absalom ' s servants set the field on fire .
and it came to pass at the end of forty days , that noah opened the window of the ark which he had made :
and the ark rested in the seventh month , on the seventeenth day of the month , upon the mountains of ararat .
the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped , and the rain from heaven was restrained ;
and god remembered noah , and every living thing , and all the cattle that was with him in the ark : and god made a wind to pass over the earth , and the waters asswaged ;
so joab came to the king , and told him : and when he had called for absalom , he came to the king , and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king : and the king kissed absalom .
also he sent forth a dove from him , to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground ;
but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot , and she returned unto him into the ark , for the waters were on the face of the whole earth : then he put forth his hand , and took her , and pulled her in unto him into the ark .
then thine handmaid said , the word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable : for as an angel of god , so is my lord the king to discern good and bad : therefore the lord thy god will be with thee .
for the king will hear , to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of god .
now therefore that i am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king , it is because the people have made me afraid : and thy handmaid said , i will now speak unto the king ; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid .
for we must needs die , and are as water spilt on the ground , which cannot be gathered up again ; neither doth god respect any person : yet doth he devise means , that his banished be not expelled from him .
and the woman said , wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of god ? for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty , in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished .
then the woman said , let thine handmaid , i pray thee , speak one word unto my lord the king . and he said , say on .
then said she , i pray thee , let the king remember the lord thy god , that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more , lest they destroy my son . and he said , as the lord liveth , there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth .
and the king said , whosoever saith ought unto thee , bring him to me , and he shall not touch thee any more .
then the king answered and said unto the woman , hide not from me , i pray thee , the thing that i shall ask thee . and the woman said , let my lord the king now speak .
and they shall come against thee with chariots , wagons , and wheels , and with an assembly of people , which shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about : and i will set judgment before them , and they shall judge thee according to their judgments .
the babylonians , and all the chaldeans , pekod , and shoa , and koa , and all the assyrians with them : all of them desirable young men , captains and rulers , great lords and renowned , all of them riding upon horses .
they shall also strip thee out of thy clothes , and take away thy fair jewels .
and i will set my jealousy against thee , and they shall deal furiously with thee : they shall take away thy nose and thine ears ; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword : they shall take thy sons and thy daughters ; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire .
for she doted upon their paramours , whose flesh is as the flesh of asses , and whose issue is like the issue of horses .
there , o aholibah , thus saith the lord god ; behold , i will raise up thy lovers against thee , from whom thy mind is alienated , and i will bring them against thee on every side ;
thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth , in bruising thy teats by the egyptians for the paps of thy youth .
for thus saith the lord god ; behold , i will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest , into the hand of them from whom thy mind is alienated :
thus will i make thy lewdness to cease from thee , and thy whoredom brought from the land of egypt : so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them , nor remember egypt any more .
and when he polled his head , ( for it was at every year ' s end that he polled it : because the hair was heavy on him , therefore he polled it : ) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king ' s weight .
but in all israel there was none to be so much praised as absalom for his beauty : from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him .
so absalom dwelt two full years in jerusalem , and saw not the king ' s face .
and unto absalom there were born three sons , and one daughter , whose name was tamar : she was a woman of a fair countenance .
and joab fell to the ground on his face , and bowed himself , and thanked the king : and joab said , to day thy servant knoweth that i have found grace in thy sight , my lord , o king , in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant .
and the king said unto joab , behold now , i have done this thing : go therefore , bring the young man absalom again .
and the king said , let him turn to his own house , and let him not see my face . so absalom returned to his own house , and saw not the king ' s face .
so joab arose and went to geshur , and brought absalom to jerusalem .
and furthermore , that ye have sent for men to come from far , unto whom a messenger was sent ; and , lo , they came : for whom thou didst wash thyself , paintedst thy eyes , and deckedst thyself with ornaments ,
therefore absalom sent for joab , to have sent him to the king ; but he would not come to him : and when he sent again the second time , he would not come .
that they have committed adultery , and blood is in their hands , and with their idols have they committed adultery , and have also caused their sons , whom they bare unto me , to pass for them through the fire , to devour them .
the lord said moreover unto me ; son of man , wilt thou judge aholah and aholibah ? yea , declare unto them their abominations ;
therefore thus saith the lord god ; because thou hast forgotten me , and cast me behind thy back , therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms .
thou shalt even drink it and suck it out , and thou shalt break the sherds thereof , and pluck off thine own breasts : for i have spoken it , saith the lord god .
and he fell to the earth , and heard a voice saying unto him , saul , saul , why persecutest thou me ?
thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow , with the cup of astonishment and desolation , with the cup of thy sister samaria .
and as he journeyed , he came near damascus : and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven :
thus saith the lord god ; thou shalt drink of thy sister ' s cup deep and large : thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision ; it containeth much .
and desired of him letters to damascus to the synagogues , that if he found any of this way , whether they were men or women , he might bring them bound unto jerusalem .
thou hast walked in the way of thy sister ; therefore will i give her cup into thine hand .
and saul , yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the lord , went unto the high priest ,
i will do these things unto thee , because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen , and because thou art polluted with their idols .
and saul arose from the earth ; and when his eyes were opened , he saw no man : but they led him by the hand , and brought him into damascus .
and the men which journeyed with him stood speechless , hearing a voice , but seeing no man .
and he trembling and astonished said , lord , what wilt thou have me to do ? and the lord said unto him , arise , and go into the city , and it shall be told thee what thou must do .
and he said , who art thou , lord ? and the lord said , i am jesus whom thou persecutest : it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks .
to fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant joab done this thing : and my lord is wise , according to the wisdom of an angel of god , to know all things that are in the earth .
for when they had slain their children to their idols , then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it ; and , lo , thus have they done in the midst of mine house .
and he was three days without sight , and neither did eat nor drink .
moreover this they have done unto me : they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day , and have profaned my sabbaths .
he stood , and measured the earth : he beheld , and drove asunder the nations ; and the everlasting mountains were scattered , the perpetual hills did bow : his ways are everlasting .
i saw the tents of cushan in affliction : and the curtains of the land of midian did tremble .
and his brightness was as the light ; he had horns coming out of his hand : and there was the hiding of his power .
before him went the pestilence , and burning coals went forth at his feet .
was the lord displeased against the rivers ? was thine anger against the rivers ? was thy wrath against the sea , that thou didst ride upon thine horses and thy chariots of salvation ?
thy bow was made quite naked , according to the oaths of the tribes , even thy word . selah . thou didst cleave the earth with rivers .
o lord , i have heard thy speech , and was afraid : o lord , revive thy work in the midst of the years , in the midst of the years make known ; in wrath remember mercy .
god came from teman , and the holy one from mount paran . selah . his glory covered the heavens , and the earth was full of his praise .
a prayer of habakkuk the prophet upon shigionoth .
the mountains skipped like rams , and the little hills like lambs .
the sea saw it , and fled : jordan was driven back .
judah was his sanctuary , and israel his dominion .
when israel went out of egypt , the house of jacob from a people of strange language ;
and when her sister aholibah saw this , she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she , and in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms .
these discovered her nakedness : they took her sons and her daughters , and slew her with the sword : and she became famous among women ; for they had executed judgment upon her .
girded with girdles upon their loins , exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads , all of them princes to look to , after the manner of the babylonians of chaldea , the land of their nativity :
and that she increased her whoredoms : for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall , the images of the chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion ,
then i saw that she was defiled , that they took both one way ,
she doted upon the assyrians her neighbours , captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously , horsemen riding upon horses , all of them desirable young men .
yet she multiplied her whoredoms , in calling to remembrance the days of her youth , wherein she had played the harlot in the land of egypt .
so she discovered her whoredoms , and discovered her nakedness : then my mind was alienated from her , like as my mind was alienated from her sister .
and the babylonians came to her into the bed of love , and they defiled her with their whoredom , and she was polluted with them , and her mind was alienated from them .
and as soon as she saw them with her eyes , she doted upon them , and sent messengers unto them into chaldea .
but the eyes of the wicked shall fail , and they shall not escape , and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost .
and thine age shall be clearer than the noonday ; thou shalt shine forth , thou shalt be as the morning .
because thou shalt forget thy misery , and remember it as waters that pass away :
for then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot ; yea , thou shalt be stedfast , and shalt not fear :
if iniquity be in thine hand , put it far away , and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles .
if thou prepare thine heart , and stretch out thine hands toward him ;
for vain man would be wise , though man be born like a wild ass ' s colt .
if he cut off , and shut up , or gather together , then who can hinder him ?
also thou shalt lie down , and none shall make thee afraid ; yea , many shall make suit unto thee .
and thou shalt be secure , because there is hope ; yea , thou shalt dig about thee , and thou shalt take thy rest in safety .
who is among you that feareth the lord , that obeyeth the voice of his servant , that walketh in darkness , and hath no light ? let him trust in the name of the lord , and stay upon his god .
and they shall recompense your lewdness upon you , and ye shall bear the sins of your idols : and ye shall know that i am the lord god .
neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house , lest thou be a cursed thing like it : but thou shalt utterly detest it , and thou shalt utterly abhor it ; for it is a cursed thing .
the graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire : thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them , nor take it unto thee , lest thou be snared therein : for it is an abomination to the lord thy god .
behold , all ye that kindle a fire , that compass yourselves about with sparks : walk in the light of your fire , and in the sparks that ye have kindled . this shall ye have of mine hand ; ye shall lie down in sorrow .
and a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her : and with the men of the common sort were brought sabeans from the wilderness , which put bracelets upon their hands , and beautiful crowns upon their heads .
then said i unto her that was old in adulteries , will they now commit whoredoms with her , and she with them ?
yet they went in unto her , as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot : so went they in unto aholah and unto aholibah , the lewd women .
and the righteous men , they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses , and after the manner of women that shed blood ; because they are adulteresses , and blood is in their hands .
for thus saith the lord god ; i will bring up a company upon them , and will give them to be removed and spoiled .
and the company shall stone them with stones , and dispatch them with their swords ; they shall slay their sons and their daughters , and burn up their houses with fire .
thus will i cause lewdness to cease out of the land , that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness .
and the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings , which have received no kingdom as yet ; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast .
these have one mind , and shall give their power and strength unto the beast .
and there are seven kings : five are fallen , and one is , and the other is not yet come ; and when he cometh , he must continue a short space .
and the beast that was , and is not , even he is the eighth , and is of the seven , and goeth into perdition .
for god hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will , and to agree , and give their kingdom unto the beast , until the words of god shall be fulfilled .
these shall make war with the lamb , and the lamb shall overcome them : for he is lord of lords , and king of kings : and they that are with him are called , and chosen , and faithful .
and he saith unto me , the waters which thou sawest , where the whore sitteth , are peoples , and multitudes , and nations , and tongues .
but the lord thy god shall deliver them unto thee , and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction , until they be destroyed .
and he shall deliver their kings into thine hand , and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven : there shall no man be able to stand before thee , until thou have destroyed them .
and the woman which thou sawest is that great city , which reigneth over the kings of the earth .
thou shalt not be affrighted at them : for the lord thy god is among you , a mighty god and terrible .
and the lord thy god will put out those nations before thee by little and little : thou mayest not consume them at once , lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee .
moreover the lord thy god will send the hornet among them , until they that are left , and hide themselves from thee , be destroyed .
the great temptations which thine eyes saw , and the signs , and the wonders , and the mighty hand , and the stretched out arm , whereby the lord thy god brought thee out : so shall the lord thy god do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid .
thou shalt not be afraid of them : but shalt well remember what the lord thy god did unto pharaoh , and unto all egypt ;
and thou shalt consume all the people which the lord thy god shall deliver thee ; thine eye shall have no pity upon them : neither shalt thou serve their gods ; for that will be a snare unto thee .
and the lord will take away from thee all sickness , and will put none of the evil diseases of egypt , which thou knowest , upon thee ; but will lay them upon all them that hate thee .
thou shalt be blessed above all people : there shall not be male or female barren among you , or among your cattle .
and the children of joseph said , the hill is not enough for us : and all the canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron , both they who are of beth - shean and her towns , and they who are of the valley of jezreel .
and joshua answered them , if thou be a great people , then get thee up to the wood country , and cut down for thyself there in the land of the perizzites and of the giants , if mount ephraim be too narrow for thee .
but the mountain shall be thine ; for it is a wood , and thou shalt cut it down : and the outgoings of it shall be thine : for thou shalt drive out the canaanites , though they have iron chariots , and though they be strong .
and joshua spake unto the house of joseph , even to ephraim and to manasseh , saying , thou art a great people , and hast great power : thou shalt not have one lot only :
am i not an apostle ? am i not free ? have i not seen jesus christ our lord ? are not ye my work in the lord ?
wherefore it shall come to pass , if ye hearken to these judgments , and keep , and do them , that the lord thy god shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers :
thou shalt therefore keep the commandments , and the statutes , and the judgments , which i command thee this day , to do them .
and repayeth them that hate him to their face , to destroy them : he will not be slack to him that hateth him , he will repay him to his face .
for it is written in the law of moses , thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn . doth god take care for oxen ?
and samuel did that which the lord spake , and came to bethlehem . and the elders of the town trembled at his coming , and said , comest thou peaceably ?
say i these things as a man ? or saith not the law the same also ?
and he said , peaceably : i am come to sacrifice unto the lord : sanctify yourselves , and come with me to the sacrifice . and he sanctified jesse and his sons , and called them to the sacrifice .
who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges ? who planteth a vineyard , and eateth not of the fruit thereof ? or who feedeth a flock , and eateth not of the milk of the flock ?
and samuel said , how can i go ? if saul hear it , he will kill me . and the lord said , take an heifer with thee , and say , i am come to sacrifice to the lord .
or i only and barnabas , have not we power to forbear working ?
and call jesse to the sacrifice , and i will shew thee what thou shalt do : and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom i name unto thee .
have we not power to lead about a sister , a wife , as well as other apostles , and as the brethren of the lord , and cephas ?
have we not power to eat and to drink ?
and the lord said unto samuel , how long wilt thou mourn for saul , seeing i have rejected him from reigning over israel ? fill thine horn with oil , and go , i will send thee to jesse the bethlehemite : for i have provided me a king among his sons .
mine answer to them that do examine me is this ,
if i be not an apostle unto others , yet doubtless i am to you : for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the lord .
yet it came to pass , when the children of israel were waxen strong , that they put the canaanites to tribute ; but did not utterly drive them out .
and the children of joseph spake unto joshua , saying , why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit , seeing i am a great people , forasmuch as the lord hath blessed me hitherto ?
yet the children of manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities ; but the canaanites would dwell in that land .
then jesse called abinadab , and made him pass before samuel . and he said , neither hath the lord chosen this .
then jesse made shammah to pass by . and he said , neither hath the lord chosen this .
southward it was ephraim ' s , and northward it was manasseh ' s , and the sea is his border ; and they met together in asher on the north , and in issachar on the east .
and it came to pass , when they were come , that he looked on eliab , and said , surely the lord ' s anointed is before him .
but the lord said unto samuel , look not on his countenance , or on the height of his stature ; because i have refused him : for the lord seeth not as man seeth ; for man looketh on the outward appearance , but the lord looketh on the heart .
which turned the rock into a standing water , the flint into a fountain of waters .
tremble , thou earth , at the presence of the lord , at the presence of the god of jacob ;
ye mountains , that ye skipped like rams ; and ye little hills , like lambs ?
and jacob said unto pharaoh , the days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years : few and evil have the days of the years of my life been , and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage .
and he took some of his brethren , even five men , and presented them unto pharaoh .
then joseph came and told pharaoh , and said , my father and my brethren , and their flocks , and their herds , and all that they have , are come out of the land of canaan ; and , behold , they are in the land of goshen .
they said moreover unto pharaoh , for to sojourn in the land are we come ; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks ; for the famine is sore in the land of canaan : now therefore , we pray thee , let thy servants dwell in the land of goshen .
and it came to pass , when he began to reign , as soon as he sat on his throne , that he slew all the house of baasha : he left him not one that pisseth against a wall , neither of his kinsfolks , nor of his friends .
the land of egypt is before thee ; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell ; in the land of goshen let them dwell : and if thou knowest any men of activity among them , then make them rulers over my cattle .
thus did zimri destroy all the house of baasha , according to the word of the lord , which he spake against baasha by jehu the prophet ,
and pharaoh spake unto joseph , saying , thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee :
and pharaoh said unto jacob , how old art thou ?
and zimri went in and smote him , and killed him , in the twenty and seventh year of asa king of judah , and reigned in his stead .
and joseph brought in jacob his father , and set him before pharaoh : and jacob blessed pharaoh .
now the rest of the acts of elah , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel ?
for all the sins of baasha , and the sins of elah his son , by which they sinned , and by which they made israel to sin , in provoking the lord god of israel to anger with their vanities .
and the people that were encamped heard say , zimri hath conspired , and hath also slain the king : wherefore all israel made omri , the captain of the host , king over israel that day in the camp .
in the twenty and seventh year of asa king of judah did zimri reign seven days in tirzah . and the people were encamped against gibbethon , which belonged to the philistines .
and it came to pass , when zimri saw that the city was taken , that he went into the palace of the king ' s house , and burnt the king ' s house over him with fire , and died ,
and he beat down the tower of penuel , and slew the men of the city .
and omri went up from gibbethon , and all israel with him , and they besieged tirzah .
and he took the elders of the city , and thorns of the wilderness and briers , and with them he taught the men of succoth .
and he said , they were my brethren , even the sons of my mother : as the lord liveth , if ye had saved them alive , i would not slay you .
for his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the lord , in walking in the way of jeroboam , and in his sin which he did , to make israel to sin .
then said he unto zebah and zalmunna , what manner of men were they whom ye slew at tabor ? and they answered , as thou art , so were they ; each one resembled the children of a king .
and gideon the son of joash returned from battle before the sun was up ,
and when zebah and zalmunna fled , he pursued after them , and took the two kings of midian , zebah and zalmunna , and discomfited all the host .
and he came unto the men of succoth , and said , behold zebah and zalmunna , with whom ye did upbraid me , saying , are the hands of zebah and zalmunna now in thine hand , that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary ?
and caught a young man of the men of succoth , and inquired of him : and he described unto him the princes of succoth , and the elders thereof , even threescore and seventeen men .
and gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of nobah and jogbehah , and smote the host : for the host was secure .
now zebah and zalmunna were in karkor , and their hosts with them , about fifteen thousand men , all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east : for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword .
and he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places , and on the hills , and under every green tree .
but he walked in the way of the kings of israel , yea , and made his son to pass through the fire , according to the abominations of the heathen , whom the lord cast out from before the children of israel .
at that time rezin king of syria recovered elath to syria , and drave the jews from elath : and the syrians came to elath , and dwelt there unto this day .
then rezin king of syria and pekah son of remaliah king of israel came up to jerusalem to war : and they besieged ahaz , but could not overcome him .
twenty years old was ahaz when he began to reign , and reigned sixteen years in jerusalem , and did not that which was right in the sight of the lord his god , like david his father .
in the seventeenth year of pekah the son of remaliah ahaz the son of jotham king of judah began to reign .
and ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the lord , and in the treasures of the king ' s house , and sent it for a present to the king of assyria .
now the rest of the acts of zimri , and his treason that he wrought , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel ?
so ahaz sent messengers to tiglath - pileser king of assyria , saying , i am thy servant and thy son : come up , and save me out of the hand of the king of syria , and out of the hand of the king of israel , which rise up against me .
then were the people of israel divided into two parts : half of the people followed tibni the son of ginath , to make him king ; and half followed omri .
but the people that followed omri prevailed against the people that followed tibni the son of ginath : so tibni died , and omri reigned .
and the king of assyria hearkened unto him : for the king of assyria went up against damascus , and took it , and carried the people of it captive to kir , and slew rezin .
in the thirty and first year of asa king of judah began omri to reign over israel , twelve years : six years reigned he in tirzah .
and jerubbaal the son of joash went and dwelt in his own house .
thus was midian subdued before the children of israel , so that they lifted up their heads no more . and the country was in quietness forty years in the days of gideon .
and gideon made an ephod thereof , and put it in his city , even in ophrah : and all israel went thither a whoring after it : which thing became a snare unto gideon , and to his house .
now the rest of the acts of omri which he did , and his might that he shewed , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel ?
for he walked in all the way of jeroboam the son of nebat , and in his sin wherewith he made israel to sin , to provoke the lord god of israel to anger with their vanities .
but omri wrought evil in the eyes of the lord , and did worse than all that were before him .
and he bought the hill samaria of shemer for two talents of silver , and built on the hill , and called the name of the city which he built , after the name of shemer , owner of the hill , samaria .
then the men of israel said unto gideon , rule thou over us , both thou , and thy son , and thy son ' s son also : for thou hast delivered us from the hand of midian .
then zebah and zalmunna said , rise thou , and fall upon us : for as the man is , so is his strength . and gideon arose , and slew zebah and zalmunna , and took away the ornaments that were on their camels ' necks .
and the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold ; beside ornaments , and collars , and purple raiment that was on the kings of midian , and beside the chains that were about their camels ' necks .
and they answered , we will willingly give them . and they spread a garment , and did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey .
and gideon said unto them , i would desire a request of you , that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey . ( for they had golden earrings , because they were ishmaelites . )
and gideon said unto them , i will not rule over you , neither shall my son rule over you : the lord shall rule over you .
and ahab made a grove ; and ahab did more to provoke the lord god of israel to anger than all the kings of israel that were before him .
in his days did hiel the bethelite build jericho : he laid the foundation thereof in abiram his firstborn , and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son segub , according to the word of the lord , which he spake by joshua the son of nun .
and it came to pass , as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat , that he took to wife jezebel the daughter of ethbaal king of the zidonians , and went and served baal , and worshipped him .
and he reared up an altar for baal in the house of baal , which he had built in samaria .
and ahab the son of omri did evil in the sight of the lord above all that were before him .
and gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten : for he had many wives .
and it came to pass , as soon as gideon was dead , that the children of israel turned again , and went a whoring after baalim , and made baal - berith their god .
and gideon the son of joash died in a good old age , and was buried in the sepulchre of joash his father , in ophrah of the abi - ezrites .
neither shewed they kindness to the house of jerubbaal , namely , gideon , according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto israel .
and the children of israel remembered not the lord their god , who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side :
also amaziah said unto amos , o thou seer , go , flee thee away into the land of judah , and there eat bread , and prophesy there :
then amaziah the priest of bethel sent to jeroboam king of israel , saying , amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of israel : the land is not able to bear all his words .
therefore thus saith the lord ; thy wife shall be an harlot in the city , and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword , and thy land shall be divided by line ; and thou shalt die in a polluted land : and israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land .
now therefore hear thou the word of the lord : thou sayest , prophesy not against israel , and drop not thy word against the house of isaac .
and the lord took me as i followed the flock , and the lord said unto me , go , prophesy unto my people israel .
then answered amos , and said to amaziah , i was no prophet , neither was i a prophet ' s son ; but i was an herdman , and a gatherer of sycomore fruit :
but prophesy not again any more at bethel : for it is the king ' s chapel , and it is the king ' s court .
i had many things to write , but i will not with ink and pen write unto thee :
demetrius hath good report of all men , and of the truth itself : yea , and we also bear record ; and ye know that our record is true .
lift up your eyes , and behold them that come from the north : where is the flock that was given thee , thy beautiful flock ?
and if thou say in thine heart , wherefore come these things upon me ? for the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts discovered , and thy heels made bare .
what wilt thou say when he shall punish thee ? for thou hast taught them to be captains , and as chief over thee : shall not sorrows take thee , as a woman in travail ?
therefore will i scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the wind of the wilderness .
can the ethiopian change his skin , or the leopard his spots ? then may ye also do good , that are accustomed to do evil .
therefore will i discover thy skirts upon thy face , that thy shame may appear .
this is thy lot , the portion of thy measures from me , saith the lord ; because thou hast forgotten me , and trusted in falsehood .
i have seen thine adulteries , and thy neighings , the lewdness of thy whoredom , and thine abominations on the hills in the fields . woe unto thee , o jerusalem ! wilt thou not be made clean ? when shall it once be ?
the ungodly are not so : but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away .
and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water , that bringeth forth his fruit in his season ; his leaf also shall not wither ; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper .
but his delight is in the law of the lord ; and in his law doth he meditate day and night .
blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly , nor standeth in the way of sinners , nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful .
for the lord knoweth the way of the righteous : but the way of the ungodly shall perish .
therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment , nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous .
but if ye will not hear it , my soul shall weep in secret places for your pride ; and mine eye shall weep sore , and run down with tears , because the lord ' s flock is carried away captive .
give glory to the lord your god , before he cause darkness , and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains , and , while ye look for light , he turn it into the shadow of death , and make it gross darkness .
and he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance , and hath called all the sons of the king , and abiathar the priest , and joab the captain of the host : but solomon thy servant hath he not called .
hear ye , and give ear ; be not proud : for the lord hath spoken .
then shalt thou say unto them , thus saith the lord , behold , i will fill all the inhabitants of this land , even the kings that sit upon david ' s throne , and the priests , and the prophets , and all the inhabitants of jerusalem , with drunkenness .
this evil people , which refuse to hear my words , which walk in the imagination of their heart , and walk after other gods , to serve them , and to worship them , shall even be as this girdle , which is good for nothing .
behold , while thou yet talkest there with the king , i also will come in after thee , and confirm thy words .
go and get thee in unto king david , and say unto him , didst not thou , my lord , o king , swear unto thine handmaid , saying , assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me , and he shall sit upon my throne ? why then doth adonijah reign ?
now therefore come , let me , i pray thee , give thee counsel , that thou mayest save thine own life , and the life of thy son solomon .
and all the congregation of the children of israel journeyed from the wilderness of sin , after their journeys , according to the commandment of the lord , and pitched in rephidim : and there was no water for the people to drink .
wherefore nathan spake unto bath - sheba the mother of solomon , saying , hast thou not heard that adonijah the son of haggith doth reign , and david our lord knoweth it not ?
and now , behold , adonijah reigneth ; and now , my lord the king , thou knowest it not :
and she said unto him , my lord , thou swarest by the lord thy god unto thine handmaid , saying , assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me , and he shall sit upon my throne .
and bath - sheba bowed , and did obeisance unto the king . and the king said , what wouldest thou ?
say unto the king and to the queen , humble yourselves , sit down : for your principalities shall come down , even the crown of your glory .
and bath - sheba went in unto the king into the chamber : and the king was very old ; and abishag the shunammite ministered unto the king .
the cities of the south shall be shut up , and none shall open them : judah shall be carried away captive all of it , it shall be wholly carried away captive .
and he called the name of the place massah , and meribah , because of the chiding of the children of israel , and because they tempted the lord , saying , is the lord among us , or not ?
behold , i will stand before thee there upon the rock in horeb ; and thou shalt smite the rock , and there shall come water out of it , that the people may drink . and moses did so in the sight of the elders of israel .
and moses said unto joshua , choose us out men , and go out , fight with amalek : to morrow i will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of god in mine hand .
then came amalek , and fought with israel in rephidim .
but nathan the prophet , and benaiah , and the mighty men , and solomon his brother , he called not .
and the people thirsted there for water ; and the people murmured against moses , and said , wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of egypt , to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst ?
wherefore the people did chide with moses , and said , give us water that we may drink . and moses said unto them , why chide ye with me ? wherefore do ye tempt the lord ?
and the lord said unto moses , go on before the people , and take with thee of the elders of israel ; and thy rod , wherewith thou smotest the river , take in thine hand , and go .
and moses cried unto the lord , saying , what shall i do unto this people ? they be almost ready to stone me .
and they told the king , saying , behold nathan the prophet . and when he was come in before the king , he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground .
and , lo , while she yet talked with the king , nathan the prophet also came in .
and nathan said , my lord , o king , hast thou said , adonijah shall reign after me , and he shall sit upon my throne ?
is this thing done by my lord the king , and thou hast not shewed it unto thy servant , who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him ?
but me , even me thy servant , and zadok the priest , and benaiah the son of jehoiada , and thy servant solomon , hath he not called .
and the king sware , and said , as the lord liveth , that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress ,
then king david answered and said , call me bath - sheba . and she came into the king ' s presence , and stood before the king .
otherwise it shall come to pass , when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers , that i and my son solomon shall be counted offenders .
by pureness , by knowledge , by longsuffering , by kindness , by the holy ghost , by love unfeigned ,
by the word of truth , by the power of god , by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left ,
but in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of god , in much patience , in afflictions , in necessities , in distresses ,
in stripes , in imprisonments , in tumults , in labours , in watchings , in fastings ;
by honour and dishonour , by evil report and good report : as deceivers , and yet true ;
as unknown , and yet well known ; as dying , and , behold , we live ; as chastened , and not killed ;
and said , o my god , i am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee , my god : for our iniquities are increased over our head , and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens .
and ishmael his son was thirteen years old , when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin .
in the selfsame day was abraham circumcised , and ishmael his son .
and now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the lord our god , to leave us a remnant to escape , and to give us a nail in his holy place , that our god may lighten our eyes , and give us a little reviving in our bondage .
and all the men of his house , born in the house , and bought with money of the stranger , were circumcised with him .
and when i heard this thing , i rent my garment and my mantle , and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard , and sat down astonied .
for they have taken of their daughters for themselves , and for their sons : so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands : yea , the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass .
and at the evening sacrifice i arose up from my heaviness ; and having rent my garment and my mantle , i fell upon my knees , and spread out my hands unto the lord my god .
then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the god of israel , because of the transgression of those that had been carried away ; and i sat astonied until the evening sacrifice .
then bath - sheba bowed with her face to the earth , and did reverence to the king , and said , let my lord king david live for ever .
and king david said , call me zadok the priest , and nathan the prophet , and benaiah the son of jehoiada . and they came before the king .
even as i sware unto thee by the lord god of israel , saying , assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me , and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead ; even so will i certainly do this day .
and zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle , and anointed solomon . and they blew the trumpet ; and all the people said , god save king solomon .
as the lord hath been with my lord the king , even so be he with solomon , and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king david .
so zadok the priest , and nathan the prophet , and benaiah the son of jehoiada , and the cherethites , and the pelethites , went down , and caused solomon to ride upon king david ' s mule , and brought him to gihon .
then ye shall come up after him , that he may come and sit upon my throne ; for he shall be king in my stead : and i have appointed him to be ruler over israel and over judah .
and benaiah the son of jehoiada answered the king , and said , amen : the lord god of my lord the king say so too .
the king also said unto them , take with you the servants of your lord , and cause solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule , and bring him down to gihon :
and let zadok the priest and nathan the prophet anoint him there king over israel : and blow ye with the trumpet , and say , god save king solomon .
for a day in thy courts is better than a thousand . i had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my god , than to dwell in the tents of wickedness .
o lord of hosts , blessed is the man that trusteth in thee .
for the lord god is a sun and shield : the lord will give grace and glory : no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly .
and all the people came up after him , and the people piped with pipes , and rejoiced with great joy , so that the earth rent with the sound of them .
and adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating . and when joab heard the sound of the trumpet , he said , wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar ?
and while he yet spake , behold , jonathan the son of abiathar the priest came : and adonijah said unto him , come in ; for thou art a valiant man , and bringest good tidings .
and jonathan answered and said to adonijah , verily our lord king david hath made solomon king .
and also thus said the king , blessed be the lord god of israel , which hath given one to sit on my throne this day , mine eyes even seeing it .
and all the guests that were with adonijah were afraid , and rose up , and went every man his way .
we then , as workers together with him , beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of god in vain .
and the king hath sent with him zadok the priest , and nathan the prophet , and benaiah the son of jehoiada , and the cherethites , and the pelethites , and they have caused him to ride upon the king ' s mule :
and zadok the priest and nathan the prophet have anointed him king in gihon : and they are come up from thence rejoicing , so that the city rang again . this is the noise that ye have heard .
giving no offence in any thing , that the ministry be not blamed :
and also solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom .
( for he saith , i have heard thee in a time accepted , and in the day of salvation have i succoured thee : behold , now is the accepted time ; behold , now is the day of salvation . )
and moreover the king ' s servants came to bless our lord king david , saying , god make the name of solomon better than thy name , and make his throne greater than thy throne . and the king bowed himself upon the bed .
which is come unto you , as it is in all the world ; and bringeth forth fruit , as it doth also in you , since the day ye heard of it , and knew the grace of god in truth :
this is my covenant , which ye shall keep , between me and you and thy seed after thee ; every man child among you shall be circumcised .
for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven , whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel ;
and adonijah feared because of solomon , and arose , and went , and caught hold on the horns of the altar .
beloved , follow not that which is evil , but that which is good . he that doeth good is of god : but he that doeth evil hath not seen god .
since we heard of your faith in christ jesus , and of the love which ye have to all the saints ,
and he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you , every man child in your generations , he that is born in the house , or bought with money of any stranger , which is not of thy seed .
we give thanks to god and the father of our lord jesus christ , praying always for you ,
and ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin ; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you .
to the saints and faithful brethren in christ which are at colosse : grace be unto you , and peace , from god our father and the lord jesus christ .
so king solomon sent , and they brought him down from the altar . and he came and bowed himself to king solomon : and solomon said unto him , go to thine house .
paul , an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god , and timotheus our brother ,
and it was told solomon , saying , behold , adonijah feareth king solomon : for , lo , he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar , saying , let king solomon swear unto me to day that he will not slay his servant with the sword .
and solomon said , if he will shew himself a worthy man , there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth : but if wickedness shall be found in him , he shall die .
and god said , sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed ; and thou shalt call his name isaac : and i will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant , and with his seed after him .
then abraham fell upon his face , and laughed , and said in his heart , shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old ? and shall sarah , that is ninety years old , bear ?
and abraham said unto god , o that ishmael might live before thee !
as ye also learned of epaphras our dear fellowservant , who is for you a faithful minister of christ ;
and god said unto abraham , as for sarai thy wife , thou shalt not call her name sarai , but sarah shall her name be .
who also declared unto us your love in the spirit .
and i will bless her , and give thee a son also of her : yea , i will bless her , and she shall be a mother of nations ; kings of people shall be of her .
for this cause we also , since the day we heard it , do not cease to pray for you , and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding ;
he that is born in thy house , and he that is bought with thy money , must needs be circumcised : and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant .
and the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised , that soul shall be cut off from his people ; he hath broken my covenant .
and abraham took ishmael his son , and all that were born in his house , and all that were bought with his money , every male among the men of abraham ' s house ; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day , as god had said unto him .
and he left off talking with him , and god went up from abraham .
but my covenant will i establish with isaac , which sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year .
and as for ishmael , i have heard thee : behold , i have blessed him , and will make him fruitful , and will multiply him exceedingly ; twelve princes shall he beget , and i will make him a great nation .
and the third day there was a marriage in cana of galilee ; and the mother of jesus was there :
and both jesus was called , and his disciples , to the marriage .
moreover , brethren , i would not that ye should be ignorant , how that all our fathers were under the cloud , and all passed through the sea ;
now these things were our examples , to the intent we should not lust after evil things , as they also lusted .
and the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth , and upon every fowl of the air , upon all that moveth upon the earth , and upon all the fishes of the sea ; into your hand are they delivered .
neither be ye idolaters , as were some of them ; as it is written , the people sat down to eat and drink , and rose up to play .
and god blessed noah and his sons , and said unto them , be fruitful , and multiply , and replenish the earth .
neither let us commit fornication , as some of them committed , and fell in one day three and twenty thousand .
neither let us tempt christ , as some of them also tempted , and were destroyed of serpents .
and were all baptized unto moses in the cloud and in the sea ;
whoso sheddeth man ' s blood , by man shall his blood be shed : for in the image of god made he man .
and did all eat the same spiritual meat ;
and surely your blood of your lives will i require ; at the hand of every beast will i require it , and at the hand of man ; at the hand of every man ' s brother will i require the life of man .
and did all drink the same spiritual drink : for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them : and that rock was christ .
but flesh with the life thereof , which is the blood thereof , shall ye not eat .
but with many of them god was not well pleased : for they were overthrown in the wilderness .
every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you ; even as the green herb have i given you all things .
jesus saith unto her , woman , what have i to do with thee ? mine hour is not yet come .
and when they wanted wine , the mother of jesus saith unto him , they have no wine .
and i , behold , i establish my covenant with you , and with your seed after you ;
and there were set there six waterpots of stone , after the manner of the purifying of the jews , containing two or three firkins apiece .
and god spake unto noah , and to his sons with him , saying ,
his mother saith unto the servants , whatsoever he saith unto you , do it .
and he saith unto them , draw out now , and bear unto the governor of the feast . and they bare it .
when the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine , and knew not whence it was : ( but the servants which drew the water knew ; ) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom ,
the voice of the lord maketh the hinds to calve , and discovereth the forests : and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory .
the voice of the lord shaketh the wilderness ; the lord shaketh the wilderness of kadesh .
the voice of the lord divideth the flames of fire .
for now we live , if ye stand fast in the lord .
and esther answered , if it seem good unto the king , let the king and haman come this day unto the banquet that i have prepared for him .
he maketh them also to skip like a calf ; lebanon and sirion like a young unicorn .
for what thanks can we render to god again for you , for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our god ;
then said the king unto her , what wilt thou , queen esther ? and what is thy request ? it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom .
the voice of the lord breaketh the cedars ; yea , the lord breaketh the cedars of lebanon .
and it was so , when the king saw esther the queen standing in the court , that she obtained favour in his sight : and the king held out to esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand . so esther drew near , and touched the top of the sceptre .
the voice of the lord is powerful ; the voice of the lord is full of majesty .
now it came to pass on the third day , that esther put on her royal apparel , and stood in the inner court of the king ' s house , over against the king ' s house : and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house , over against the gate of the house .
the voice of the lord is upon the waters : the god of glory thundereth : the lord is upon many waters .
for verily , when we were with you , we told you before that we should suffer tribulation ; even as it came to pass , and ye know .
if i have found favour in the sight of the king , and if it please the king to grant my petition , and to perform my request , let the king and haman come to the banquet that i shall prepare for them , and i will do tomorrow as the king hath said .
give unto the lord the glory due unto his name ; worship the lord in the beauty of holiness .
for this cause , when i could no longer forbear , i sent to know your faith , lest by some means the tempter have tempted you , and our labour be in vain .
then answered esther , and said , my petition and my request is ;
give unto the lord , o ye mighty , give unto the lord glory and strength .
but now when timotheus came from you unto us , and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity , and that ye have good remembrance of us always , desiring greatly to see us , as we also to see you :
and the king said unto esther at the banquet of wine , what is thy petition ? and it shall be granted thee : and what is thy request ? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed .
therefore , brethren , we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith :
then the king said , cause haman to make haste , that he may do as esther hath said . so the king and haman came to the banquet that esther had prepared .
wherefore when we could no longer forbear , we thought it good to be left at athens alone ;
and sent timotheus , our brother , and minister of god , and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of christ , to establish you , and to comfort you concerning your faith :
that no man should be moved by these afflictions : for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto .
then went haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart : but when haman saw mordecai in the king ' s gate , that he stood not up , nor moved for him , he was full of indignation against mordecai .
furthermore he made the court of the priests , and the great court , and doors for the court , and overlaid the doors of them with brass .
he made also ten tables , and placed them in the temple , five on the right side , and five on the left . and he made an hundred basons of gold .
and he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form , and set them in the temple , five on the right hand , and five on the left .
he made also ten lavers , and put five on the right hand , and five on the left , to wash in them : such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them ; but the sea was for the priests to wash in .
and the thickness of it was an handbreadth , and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup , with flowers of lilies ; and it received and held three thousand baths .
it stood upon twelve oxen , three looking toward the north , and three looking toward the west , and three looking toward the south , and three looking toward the east : and the sea was set above upon them , and all their hinder parts were inward .
and under it was the similitude of oxen , which did compass it round about : ten in a cubit , compassing the sea round about . two rows of oxen were cast , when it was cast .
also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim , round in compass , and five cubits the height thereof ; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about .
moreover he made an altar of brass , twenty cubits the length thereof , and twenty cubits the breadth thereof , and ten cubits the height thereof .
send to all them of the captivity , saying , thus saith the lord concerning shemaiah the nehelamite ; because that shemaiah hath prophesied unto you , and i sent him not , and he caused you to trust in a lie :
therefore thus saith the lord ; behold , i will punish shemaiah the nehelamite , and his seed : he shall not have a man to dwell among this people ; neither shall he behold the good that i will do for my people , saith the lord ; because he hath taught rebellion against the lord .
then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah , saying ,
sixteen years old was he when he began to reign , and he reigned two and fifty years in jerusalem . and his mother ' s name was jecholiah of jerusalem .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord , according to all that his father amaziah had done ;
hear ye therefore the word of the lord , all ye of the captivity , whom i have sent from jerusalem to babylon :
in the twenty and seventh year of jeroboam king of israel began azariah son of amaziah king of judah to reign .
and the rest of the acts of azariah , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah ?
and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of judah which are in babylon , saying , the lord make thee like zedekiah and like ahab , whom the king of babylon roasted in the fire ;
so azariah slept with his fathers ; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of david : and jotham his son reigned in his stead .
save that the high places were not removed : the people sacrificed and burnt incense still on the high places .
thus shalt thou also speak to shemaiah the nehelamite , saying ,
the lord hath made thee priest in the stead of jehoiada the priest , that ye should be officers in the house of the lord , for every man that is mad , and maketh himself a prophet , that thou shouldest put him in prison , and in the stocks .
now therefore why hast thou not reproved jeremiah of anathoth , which maketh himself a prophet to you ?
in the thirty and eighth year of azariah king of judah did zachariah the son of jeroboam reign over israel in samaria six months .
for therefore he sent unto us in babylon , saying , this captivity is long : build ye houses , and dwell in them ; and plant gardens , and eat the fruit of them .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord , as his fathers had done : he departed not from the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat , who made israel to sin .
and zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of jeremiah the prophet .
but there was a certain man , called simon , which beforetime in the same city used sorcery , and bewitched the people of samaria , giving out that himself was some great one :
and there was great joy in that city .
for unclean spirits , crying with loud voice , came out of many that were possessed with them : and many taken with palsies , and that were lame , were healed .
then philip went down to the city of samaria , and preached christ unto them .
as for saul , he made havock of the church , entering into every house , and haling men and women committed them to prison .
and devout men carried stephen to his burial , and made great lamentation over him .
and saul was consenting unto his death . and at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at jerusalem ; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of judaea and samaria , except the apostles .
now when paul and his company loosed from paphos , they came to perga in pamphylia : and john departing from them returned to jerusalem .
for the vision is yet for an appointed time , but at the end it shall speak , and not lie : though it tarry , wait for it ; because it will surely come , it will not tarry .
but when they departed from perga , they came to antioch in pisidia , and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day , and sat down .
behold , his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him : but the just shall live by his faith .
and now , behold , the hand of the lord is upon thee , and thou shalt be blind , not seeing the sun for a season . and immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness ; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand .
i will stand upon my watch , and set me upon the tower , and will watch to see what he will say unto me , and what i shall answer when i am reproved .
then the deputy , when he saw what was done , believed , being astonished at the doctrine of the lord .
and the lord answered me , and said , write the vision , and make it plain upon tables , that he may run that readeth it .
and said , o full of all subtilty and all mischief , thou child of the devil , thou enemy of all righteousness , wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the lord ?
and when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of chanaan , he divided their land to them by lot .
woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house , that he may set his nest on high , that he may be delivered from the power of evil !
the god of this people of israel chose our fathers , and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of egypt , and with an high arm brought he them out of it .
shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee , and awake that shall vex thee , and thou shalt be for booties unto them ?
and about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness .
because thou hast spoiled many nations , all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee ; because of men ' s blood , and for the violence of the land , of the city , and of all that dwell therein .
and after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them , saying , ye men and brethren , if ye have any word of exhortation for the people , say on .
yea also , because he transgresseth by wine , he is a proud man , neither keepeth at home , who enlargeth his desire as hell , and is as death , and cannot be satisfied , but gathereth unto him all nations , and heapeth unto him all people :
then paul stood up , and beckoning with his hand said , men of israel , and ye that fear god , give audience .
shall not all these take up a parable against him , and a taunting proverb against him , and say , woe to him that increaseth that which is not his ! how long ? and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay !
he was unto me as a bear lying in wait , and as a lion in secret places .
he hath turned aside my ways , and pulled me in pieces : he hath made me desolate .
he hath bent his bow , and set me as a mark for the arrow .
he hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins .
my soul hath them still in remembrance , and is humbled in me .
and by him all that believe are justified from all things , from which ye could not be justified by the law of moses .
be it known unto you therefore , men and brethren , that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins :
but he , whom god raised again , saw no corruption .
the lord is my portion , saith my soul ; therefore will i hope in him .
they are new every morning : great is thy faithfulness .
it is of the lord ' s mercies that we are not consumed , because his compassions fail not .
this i recall to my mind , therefore have i hope .
and we declare unto you glad tidings , how that the promise which was made unto the fathers ,
and he was seen many days of them which came up with him from galilee to jerusalem , who are his witnesses unto the people .
but god raised him from the dead :
for david , after he had served his own generation by the will of god , fell on sleep , and was laid unto his fathers , and saw corruption :
wherefore he saith also in another psalm , thou shalt not suffer thine holy one to see corruption .
and as concerning that he raised him up from the dead , now no more to return to corruption , he said on this wise , i will give you the sure mercies of david .
god hath fulfilled the same unto us their children , in that he hath raised up jesus again ; as it is also written in the second psalm , thou art my son , this day have i begotten thee .
thou prevailest for ever against him , and he passeth : thou changest his countenance , and sendest him away .
his sons come to honour , and he knoweth it not ; and they are brought low , but he perceiveth it not of them .
but his flesh upon him shall have pain , and his soul within him shall mourn .
he hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones , he hath covered me with ashes .
and thou hast removed my soul far off from peace : i forgat prosperity .
i was a derision to all my people ; and their song all the day .
he hath filled me with bitterness , he hath made me drunken with wormwood .
remembering mine affliction and my misery , the wormwood and the gall .
for they that dwell at jerusalem , and their rulers , because they knew him not , nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day , they have fulfilled them in condemning him .
men and brethren , children of the stock of abraham , and whosoever among you feareth god , to you is the word of this salvation sent .
and when they had fulfilled all that was written of him , they took him down from the tree , and laid him in a sepulchre .
for the lord will not cast off for ever :
and though they found no cause of death in him , yet desired they pilate that he should be slain .
he giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him : he is filled full with reproach .
for he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men .
but though he cause grief , yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies .
to turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most high ,
to crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth ,
and afterward they desired a king : and god gave unto them saul the son of cis , a man of the tribe of benjamin , by the space of forty years .
and after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years , until samuel the prophet .
of this man ' s seed hath god according to his promise raised unto israel a saviour , jesus :
and when he had removed him , he raised up unto them david to be their king ; to whom also he gave testimony , and said , i have found david the son of jesse , a man after mine own heart , which shall fulfil all my will .
and as john fulfilled his course , he said , whom think ye that i am ? i am not he . but , behold , there cometh one after me , whose shoes of his feet i am not worthy to loose .
when john had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of israel .
hell and destruction are before the lord : how much more then the hearts of the children of men ?
correction is grievous unto him that forsaketh the way : and he that hateth reproof shall die .
a merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance : but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken .
a scorner loveth not one that reproveth him : neither will he go unto the wise .
the lord is good unto them that wait for him , to the soul that seeketh him .
it is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the lord .
it is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth .
he sitteth alone and keepeth silence , because he hath borne it upon him .
he putteth his mouth in the dust ; if so be there may be hope .
all our enemies have opened their mouths against us .
thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people .
thou hast covered thyself with a cloud , that our prayer should not pass through .
because they have not hearkened to my words , saith the lord , which i sent unto them by my servants the prophets , rising up early and sending them ; but ye would not hear , saith the lord .
thou hast covered with anger , and persecuted us : thou hast slain , thou hast not pitied .
and i will persecute them with the sword , with the famine , and with the pestilence , and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth , to be a curse , and an astonishment , and an hissing , and a reproach , among all the nations whither i have driven them :
we have transgressed and have rebelled : thou hast not pardoned .
thus saith the lord of hosts ; behold , i will send upon them the sword , the famine , and the pestilence , and will make them like vile figs , that cannot be eaten , they are so evil .
let us lift up our heart with our hands unto god in the heavens .
let us search and try our ways , and turn again to the lord .
because ye have said , the lord hath raised us up prophets in babylon ;
and ye shall seek me , and find me , when ye shall search for me with all your heart .
then shall ye call upon me , and ye shall go and pray unto me , and i will hearken unto you .
for i know the thoughts that i think toward you , saith the lord , thoughts of peace , and not of evil , to give you an expected end .
for thus saith the lord , that after seventy years be accomplished at babylon i will visit you , and perform my good word toward you , in causing you to return to this place .
and the disciples were filled with joy , and with the holy ghost .
but they shook off the dust of their feet against them , and came unto iconium .
out of the mouth of the most high proceedeth not evil and good ?
wherefore doth a living man complain , a man for the punishment of his sins ?
to subvert a man in his cause , the lord approveth not .
who is he that saith , and it cometh to pass , when the lord commandeth it not ?
i called upon thy name , o lord , out of the low dungeon .
thou drewest near in the day that i called upon thee : thou saidst , fear not .
thou hast heard my voice : hide not thine ear at my breathing , at my cry .
and the word of the lord was published throughout all the region .
then came the children of israel , even the whole congregation , into the desert of zin in the first month : and the people abode in kadesh ; and miriam died there , and was buried there .
mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city .
and when the gentiles heard this , they were glad , and glorified the word of the lord : and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed .
till the lord look down , and behold from heaven .
and the people chode with moses , and spake , saying , would god that we had died when our brethren died before the lord !
they have cut off my life in the dungeon , and cast a stone upon me .
and there was no water for the congregation : and they gathered themselves together against moses and against aaron .
mine enemies chased me sore , like a bird , without cause .
but when the jews saw the multitudes , they were filled with envy , and spake against those things which were spoken by paul , contradicting and blaspheming .
and wherefore have ye made us to come up out of egypt , to bring us in unto this evil place ? it is no place of seed , or of figs , or of vines , or of pomegranates ; neither is there any water to drink .
and the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of god .
the waters wear the stones : thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth ; and thou destroyest the hope of man .
for so hath the lord commanded us , saying , i have set thee to be a light of the gentiles , that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
and surely the mountain falling cometh to nought , and the rock is removed out of his place .
then paul and barnabas waxed bold , and said , it was necessary that the word of god should first have been spoken to you : but seeing ye put it from you , and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life , lo , we turn to the gentiles .
and moses and aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , and they fell upon their faces : and the glory of the lord appeared unto them .
so they hanged haman on the gallows that he had prepared for mordecai . then was the king ' s wrath pacified .
my transgression is sealed up in a bag , and thou sewest up mine iniquity .
behold , ye despisers , and wonder , and perish : for i work a work in your days , a work which ye shall in no wise believe , though a man declare it unto you .
and moses took the rod from before the lord , as he commanded him .
for now thou numberest my steps : dost thou not watch over my sin ?
take the rod , and gather thou the assembly together , thou , and aaron thy brother , and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes ; and it shall give forth his water , and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock : so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink .
thou shalt call , and i will answer thee : thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands .
now when the congregation was broken up , many of the jews and religious proselytes followed paul and barnabas : who , speaking to them , persuaded them to continue in the grace of god .
if a man die , shall he live again ? all the days of my appointed time will i wait , till my change come .
and when the jews were gone out of the synagogue , the gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath .
o that thou wouldest hide me in the grave , that thou wouldest keep me secret , until thy wrath be past , that thou wouldest appoint me a set time , and remember me !
as the waters fail from the sea , and the flood decayeth and drieth up :
he that diggeth a pit shall fall into it ; and whoso breaketh an hedge , a serpent shall bite him .
so man lieth down , and riseth not : till the heavens be no more , they shall not awake , nor be raised out of their sleep .
whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith ; and he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby .
folly is set in great dignity , and the rich sit in low place .
but the jews stirred up the devout and honourable women , and the chief men of the city , and raised persecution against paul and barnabas , and expelled them out of their coasts .
but man dieth , and wasteth away : yea , man giveth up the ghost , and where is he ?
i have seen servants upon horses , and princes walking as servants upon the earth .
if the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee , leave not thy place ; for yielding pacifieth great offences .
there is an evil which i have seen under the sun , as an error which proceedeth from the ruler :
a wise man ' s heart is at his right hand ; but a fool ' s heart at his left .
yea also , when he that is a fool walketh by the way , his wisdom faileth him , and he saith to every one that he is a fool .
dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour : so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour .
fear and a snare is come upon us , desolation and destruction .
mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people .
mine eye trickleth down , and ceaseth not , without any intermission ,
for moses had said , consecrate yourselves to day to the lord , even every man upon his son , and upon his brother ; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day .
o lord , thou hast seen my wrong : judge thou my cause .
o lord , thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul ; thou hast redeemed my life .
now as touching things offered unto idols , we know that we all have knowledge . knowledge puffeth up , but charity edifieth .
and if any man think that he knoweth anything , he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know .
and moses said unto aaron , what did this people unto thee , that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them ?
and aaron said , let not the anger of my lord wax hot : thou knowest the people , that they are set on mischief .
for they said unto me , make us gods , which shall go before us : for as for this moses , the man that brought us up out of the land of egypt , we wot not what is become of him .
and i said unto them , whosoever hath any gold , let them break it off . so they gave it me : then i cast it into the fire , and there came out this calf .
and when moses saw that the people were naked ; ( for aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies : )
then moses stood in the gate of the camp , and said , who is on the lord ' s side ? let him come unto me . and all the sons of levi gathered themselves together unto him .
and he said unto them , thus saith the lord god of israel , put every man his sword by his side , and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp , and slay every man his brother , and every man his companion , and every man his neighbour .
and the children of levi did according to the word of moses : and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men .
and israel beheld joseph ' s sons , and said , who are these ?
and joseph said unto his father , they are my sons , whom god hath given me in this place . and he said , bring them , i pray thee , unto me , and i will bless them .
and he took the calf which they had made , and burnt it in the fire , and ground it to powder , and strawed it upon the water , and made the children of israel drink of it .
thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations against me .
and said unto me , behold , i will make thee fruitful , and multiply thee , and i will make of thee a multitude of people ; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession .
thou hast heard their reproach , o lord , and all their imaginations against me ;
and now thy two sons , ephraim and manasseh , which were born unto thee in the land of egypt before i came unto thee into egypt , are mine ; as reuben and simeon , they shall be mine .
the lips of those that rose up against me , and their device against me all the day .
and thy issue , which thou begettest after them , shall be thine , and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance .
behold their sitting down , and their rising up ; i am their musick .
and as for me , when i came from padan , rachel died by me in the land of canaan in the way , when yet there was but a little way to come unto ephrath : and i buried her there in the way of ephrath ; the same is bethlehem .
render unto them a recompence , o lord , according to the work of their hands .
give them sorrow of heart , thy curse unto them .
and it came to pass after these things , that one told joseph , behold , thy father is sick : and he took with him his two sons , manasseh and ephraim .
persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the lord .
and one told jacob , and said , behold , thy son joseph cometh unto thee : and israel strengthened himself , and sat upon the bed .
and jacob said unto joseph , god almighty appeared unto me at luz in the land of canaan , and blessed me ,
and he said , it is not the voice of them that shout for mastery , neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome : but the noise of them that sing do i hear .
and it came to pass , as soon as he came nigh unto the camp , that he saw the calf , and the dancing : and moses ' anger waxed hot , and he cast the tables out of his hands , and brake them beneath the mount .
wherefore should the egyptians speak , and say , for mischief did he bring them out , to slay them in the mountains , and to consume them from the face of the earth ? turn from thy fierce wrath , and repent of this evil against thy people .
remember abraham , isaac , and israel , thy servants , to whom thou swarest by thine own self , and saidst unto them , i will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven , and all this land that i have spoken of will i give unto your seed , and they shall inherit it for ever .
now therefore let me alone , that my wrath may wax hot against them , and that i may consume them : and i will make of thee a great nation .
and moses besought the lord his god , and said , lord , why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people , which thou hast brought forth out of the land of egypt with great power , and with a mighty hand ?
and the tables were the work of god , and the writing was the writing of god , graven upon the tables .
and when joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted , he said unto moses , there is a noise of war in the camp .
and the lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people .
and moses turned , and went down from the mount , and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand : the tables were written on both their sides ; on the one side and on the other were they written .
but saul and the people spared agag , and the best of the sheep , and of the oxen , and of the fatlings , and the lambs , and all that was good , and would not utterly destroy them : but every thing that was vile and refuse , that they destroyed utterly .
and saul smote the amalekites from havilah until thou comest to shur , that is over against egypt .
and he took agag the king of the amalekites alive , and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword .
but to us there is but one god , the father , of whom are all things , and we in him ; and one lord jesus christ , by whom are all things , and we by him .
samuel also said unto saul , the lord sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people , over israel : now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the lord .
for though there be that are called gods , whether in heaven or in earth , ( as there be gods many , and lords many , )
thus saith the lord of hosts , i remember that which amalek did to israel , how he laid wait for him in the way , when he came up from egypt .
as concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols , we know that an idol is nothing in the world , and that there is none other god but one .
but if any man love god , the same is known of him .
and saul came to a city of amalek , and laid wait in the valley .
but take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak .
and saul said unto the kenites , go , depart , get you down from among the amalekites , lest i destroy you with them : for ye shewed kindness to all the children of israel , when they came up out of egypt . so the kenites departed from among the amalekites .
but meat commendeth us not to god : for neither , if we eat , are we the better ; neither , if we eat not , are we the worse .
now go and smite amalek , and utterly destroy all that they have , and spare them not ; but slay both man and woman , infant and suckling , ox and sheep , camel and ass .
howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge : for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol ; and their conscience being weak is defiled .
and saul gathered the people together , and numbered them in telaim , two hundred thousand footmen , and ten thousand men of judah .
folly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom : but a man of understanding walketh uprightly .
without counsel purposes are disappointed : but in the multitude of counsellers they are established .
a man hath joy by the answer of his mouth : and a word spoken in due season , how good is it !
the way of life is above to the wise , that he may depart from hell beneath .
a wise son maketh a glad father : but a foolish man despiseth his mother .
the way of the slothful man is as an hedge of thorns : but the way of the righteous is made plain .
a wrathful man stirreth up strife : but he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife .
all the days of the afflicted are evil : but he that is of a merry heart hath a continual feast .
the heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge : but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness .
better is a dinner of herbs where love is , than a stalled ox and hatred therewith .
better is little with the fear of the lord than great treasure and trouble therewith .
he that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul : but he that heareth reproof getteth understanding .
the fear of the lord is the instruction of wisdom ; and before honour is humility .
therefore now go , lead the people unto the place of which i have spoken unto thee : behold , mine angel shall go before thee : nevertheless in the day when i visit i will visit their sin upon them .
the light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart : and a good report maketh the bones fat .
and the lord plagued the people , because they made the calf , which aaron made .
the ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise .
yet now , if thou wilt forgive their sin - - ; and if not , blot me , i pray thee , out of thy book which thou hast written .
and the lord said unto moses , whosoever hath sinned against me , him will i blot out of my book .
and moses returned unto the lord , and said , oh , this people have sinned a great sin , and have made them gods of gold .
and it came to pass on the morrow , that moses said unto the people , ye have sinned a great sin : and now i will go up unto the lord ; peradventure i shall make an atonement for your sin .
the lord is far from the wicked : but he heareth the prayer of the righteous .
the heart of the righteous studieth to answer : but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things .
the thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the lord : but the words of the pure are pleasant words .
the lord will destroy the house of the proud : but he will establish the border of the widow .
so joshua ascended from gilgal , he , and all the people of war with him , and all the mighty men of valour .
joshua therefore came unto them suddenly , and went up from gilgal all night .
wherefore adoni - zedek king of jerusalem sent unto hoham king of hebron , and unto piram king of jarmuth , and unto japhia king of lachish , and unto debir king of eglon , saying ,
come up unto me , and help me , that we may smite gibeon : for it hath made peace with joshua and with the children of israel .
he maketh the barren woman to keep house , and to be a joyful mother of children . praise ye the lord .
therefore the five kings of the amorites , the king of jerusalem , the king of hebron , the king of jarmuth , the king of lachish , the king of eglon , gathered themselves together , and went up , they and all their hosts , and encamped before gibeon , and made war against it .
that he may set him with princes , even with the princes of his people .
and the men of gibeon sent unto joshua to the camp to gilgal , saying , slack not thy hand from thy servants ; come up to us quickly , and save us , and help us : for all the kings of the amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us .
he raiseth up the poor out of the dust , and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill ;
that they feared greatly , because gibeon was a great city , as one of the royal cities , and because it was greater than ai , and all the men thereof were mighty .
but thou , o lord , shalt laugh at them ; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision .
behold , they belch out with their mouth : swords are in their lips : for who , say they , doth hear ?
they return at evening : they make a noise like a dog , and go round about the city .
thou therefore , o lord god of hosts , the god of israel , awake to visit all the heathen : be not merciful to any wicked transgressors . selah .
they run and prepare themselves without my fault : awake to help me , and behold .
for , lo , they lie in wait for my soul : the mighty are gathered against me ; not for my transgression , nor for my sin , o lord .
deliver me from the workers of iniquity , and save me from bloody men .
deliver me from mine enemies , o my god : defend me from them that rise up against me .
praise ye the lord . praise , o ye servants of the lord , praise the name of the lord .
blessed be the name of the lord from this time forth and for evermore .
from the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the lord ' s name is to be praised .
the lord is high above all nations , and his glory above the heavens .
who is like unto the lord our god , who dwelleth on high ,
who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven , and in the earth !
the voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of babylon , to declare in zion the vengeance of the lord our god , the vengeance of his temple .
call together the archers against babylon : all ye that bend the bow , camp against it round about ; let none thereof escape : recompense her according to her work ; according to all that she hath done , do unto her : for she hath been proud against the lord , against the holy one of israel .
come against her from the utmost border , open her storehouses : cast her up as heaps , and destroy her utterly : let nothing of her be left .
slay all her bullocks ; let them go down to the slaughter : woe unto them ! for their day is come , the time of their visitation .
i have laid a snare for thee , and thou art also taken , o babylon , and thou wast not aware : thou art found , and also caught , because thou hast striven against the lord .
the lord hath opened his armoury , and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation : for this is the work of the lord god of hosts in the land of the chaldeans .
a sound of battle is in the land , and of great destruction .
how is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken ! how is babylon become a desolation among the nations !
( now the half that pertained unto the congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep ,
and of the children of israel ' s half , which moses divided from the men that warred ,
and moses gave the tribute , which was the lord ' s heave offering , unto eleazar the priest , as the lord commanded moses .
even of the children of israel ' s half , moses took one portion of fifty , both of man and of beast , and gave them unto the levites , which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the lord ; as the lord commanded moses .
and sixteen thousand persons ; )
and thirty thousand asses and five hundred ,
and the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred ; of which the lord ' s tribute was threescore and one .
and the lord ' s tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen .
and the beeves were thirty and six thousand ; of which the lord ' s tribute was threescore and twelve .
go up against the land of merathaim , even against it , and against the inhabitants of pekod : waste and utterly destroy after them , saith the lord , and do according to all that i have commanded thee .
in those days , and in that time , saith the lord , the iniquity of israel shall be sought for , and there shall be none ; and the sins of judah , and they shall not be found : for i will pardon them whom i reserve .
and all went to be taxed , every one into his own city .
( and this taxing was first made when cyrenius was governor of syria . )
and it came to pass in those days , that there went out a decree from caesar augustus , that all the world should be taxed .
and joseph also went up from galilee , out of the city of nazareth , into judaea , unto the city of david , which is called bethlehem ; ( because he was of the house and lineage of david : )
shout against her round about : she hath given her hand : her foundations are fallen , her walls are thrown down : for it is the vengeance of the lord : take vengeance upon her ; as she hath done , do unto her .
to be taxed with mary his espoused wife , being great with child .
cut off the sower from babylon , and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest : for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people , and they shall flee every one to his own land .
and so it was , that , while they were there , the days were accomplished that she should be delivered .
israel is a scattered sheep ; the lions have driven him away : first the king of assyria hath devoured him ; and last this nebuchadrezzar king of babylon hath broken his bones .
and she brought forth her firstborn son , and wrapped him in swaddling clothes , and laid him in a manger ; because there was no room for them in the inn .
therefore thus saith the lord of hosts , the god of israel ; behold , i will punish the king of babylon and his land , as i have punished the king of assyria .
and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field , keeping watch over their flock by night .
because ye were glad , because ye rejoiced , o ye destroyers of mine heritage , because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass , and bellow as bulls ;
and , lo , the angel of the lord came upon them , and the glory of the lord shone round about them : and they were sore afraid .
your mother shall be sore confounded ; she that bare you shall be ashamed : behold , the hindermost of the nations shall be a wilderness , a dry land , and a desert .
because of the wrath of the lord it shall not be inhabited , but it shall be wholly desolate : every one that goeth by babylon shall be astonished , and hiss at all her plagues .
put yourselves in array against babylon round about : all ye that bend the bow , shoot at her , spare no arrows : for she hath sinned against the lord .
and of the children of israel ' s half , thou shalt take one portion of fifty , of the persons , of the beeves , of the asses , and of the flocks , of all manner of beasts , and give them unto the levites , which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the lord .
and the booty , being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught , was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep ,
and moses and eleazar the priest did as the lord commanded moses .
and threescore and one thousand asses ,
and i will bring israel again to his habitation , and he shall feed on carmel and bashan , and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount ephraim and gilead .
and threescore and twelve thousand beeves ,
and the half , which was the portion of them that went out to war , was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep :
and thirty and two thousand persons in all , of woman that had not known man by lying with him .
take the sum of the prey that was taken , both of man and of beast , thou , and eleazar the priest , and the chief fathers of the congregation :
and divide the prey into two parts ; between them that took the war upon them , who went out to battle , and between all the congregation :
and levy a tribute unto the lord of the men of war which went out to battle : one soul of five hundred , both of the persons , and of the beeves , and of the asses , and of the sheep :
take it of their half , and give it unto eleazar the priest , for an heave offering of the lord .
and chaldea shall be a spoil : all that spoil her shall be satisfied , saith the lord .
at the noise of the taking of babylon the earth is moved , and the cry is heard among the nations .
therefore hear ye the counsel of the lord , that he hath taken against babylon ; and his purposes , that he hath purposed against the land of the chaldeans : surely the least of the flock shall draw them out : surely he shall make their habitation desolate with them .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
and ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day , and ye shall be clean , and afterward ye shall come into the camp .
every thing that may abide the fire , ye shall make it go through the fire , and it shall be clean : nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation : and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the water .
only the gold , and the silver , the brass , the iron , the tin , and the lead ,
and eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to the battle , this is the ordinance of the law which the lord commanded moses ;
and purify all your raiment , and all that is made of skins , and all work of goats ' hair , and all things made of wood .
and do ye abide without the camp seven days : whosoever hath killed any person , and whosoever hath touched any slain , purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day , and on the seventh day .
now therefore kill every male among the little ones , and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him .
but all the women children , that have not known a man by lying with him , keep alive for yourselves .
and moses said unto them , have ye saved all the women alive ?
behold , these caused the children of israel , through the counsel of balaam , to commit trespass against the lord in the matter of peor , and there was a plague among the congregation of the lord .
the king of babylon hath heard the report of them , and his hands waxed feeble : anguish took hold of him , and pangs as of a woman in travail .
they shall hold the bow and the lance : they are cruel , and will not shew mercy : their voice shall roar like the sea , and they shall ride upon horses , every one put in array , like a man to the battle , against thee , o daughter of babylon .
behold , a people shall come from the north , and a great nation , and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth .
as god overthrew sodom and gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof , saith the lord ; so shall no man abide there , neither shall any son of man dwell therein .
thus saith the lord of hosts ; the children of israel and the children of judah were oppressed together : and all that took them captives held them fast ; they refused to let them go .
her adversaries are the chief , her enemies prosper ; for the lord hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions : her children are gone into captivity before the enemy .
their redeemer is strong ; the lord of hosts is his name : he shall throughly plead their cause , that he may give rest to the land , and disquiet the inhabitants of babylon .
and from the daughter of zion all her beauty is departed : her princes are become like harts that find no pasture , and they are gone without strength before the pursuer .
a sword is upon the chaldeans , saith the lord , and upon the inhabitants of babylon , and upon her princes , and upon her wise men .
judah is gone into captivity because of affliction , and because of great servitude : she dwelleth among the heathen , she findeth no rest : all her persecutors overtook her between the straits .
a sword is upon the liars ; and they shall dote : a sword is upon her mighty men ; and they shall be dismayed .
the ways of zion do mourn , because none come to the solemn feasts : all her gates are desolate : her priests sigh , her virgins are afflicted , and she is in bitterness .
how doth the city sit solitary , that was full of people  how is she become as a widow she that was was great among the nations , and princess among the provinces , how is she become tributary
a drought is upon her waters ; and they shall be dried up : for it is the land of graven images , and they are mad upon their idols .
she weepeth sore in the night , and her tears are on her cheeks : among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her : all her friends have dealt treacherously with her , they are become her enemies .
therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell there , and the owls shall dwell therein : and it shall be no more inhabited for ever ; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation .
and they brought the captives , and the prey , and the spoil , unto moses , and eleazar the priest , and unto the congregation of the children of israel , unto the camp at the plains of moab , which are by jordan near jericho .
and they took all the spoil , and all the prey , both of men and of beasts .
and moses was wroth with the officers of the host , with the captains over thousands , and captains over hundreds , which came from the battle .
and moses , and eleazar the priest , and all the princes of the congregation , went forth to meet them without the camp .
her filthiness is in her skirts ; she remembereth not her last end ; therefore she came down wonderfully : she had no comforter . o lord , behold my affliction : for the enemy hath magnified himself .
and they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt , and all their goodly castles , with fire .
jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old , when her people fell into the hand of the enemy , and none did help her : the adversaries saw her , and did mock at her sabbaths .
jerusalem hath grievously sinned ; therefore she is removed : all that honoured her despise her , because they have seen her nakedness : yea , she sigheth , and turneth backward .
therefore shall her young men fall in the streets , and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day , saith the lord .
and the most proud shall stumble and fall , and none shall raise him up : and i will kindle a fire in his cities , and it shall devour all round about him .
behold , i am against thee , o thou most proud , saith the lord god of hosts : for thy day is come , the time that i will visit thee .
and lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven , and when thou seest the sun , and the moon , and the stars , even all the host of heaven , shouldest be driven to worship them , and serve them , which the lord thy god hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven .
take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves ; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the lord spake unto you in horeb out of the midst of the fire :
the likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground , the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth :
the likeness of any beast that is on the earth , the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air ,
and the lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire : ye heard the voice of the words , but saw no similitude ; only ye heard a voice .
and the lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments , that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it .
and he declared unto you his covenant , which he commanded you to perform , even ten commandments ; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone .
but the lord hath taken you , and brought you forth out of the iron furnace , even out of egypt , to be unto him a people of inheritance , as ye are this day .
furthermore the lord was angry with me for your sakes , and sware that i should not go over jordan , and that i should not go in unto that good land , which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance :
receive us ; we have wronged no man , we have corrupted no man , we have defrauded no man .
having therefore these promises , dearly beloved , let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit , perfecting holiness in the fear of god .
and not by his coming only , but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you , when he told us your earnest desire , your mourning , your fervent mind toward me ; so that i rejoiced the more .
now i rejoice , not that ye were made sorry , but that ye sorrowed to repentance : for ye were made sorry after a godly manner , that ye might receive damage by us in nothing .
i speak not this to condemn you : for i have said before , that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you .
great is my boldness of speech toward you , great is my glorying of you : i am filled with comfort , i am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation .
for , when we were come into macedonia , our flesh had no rest , but we were troubled on every side ; without were fightings , within were fears .
nevertheless god , that comforteth those that are cast down , comforted us by the coming of titus ;
and the king said , what honour and dignity hath been done to mordecai for this ? then said the king ' s servants that ministered unto him , there is nothing done for him .
and it was found written , that mordecai had told of bigthana and teresh , two of the king ' s chamberlains , the keepers of the door , who sought to lay hand on the king ahasuerus .
on that night could not the king sleep , and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles ; and they were read before the king .
let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear , and the horse that the king rideth upon , and the crown royal which is set upon his head :
and haman answered the king , for the man whom the king delighteth to honour ,
so haman came in . and the king said unto him , what shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour ? now haman thought in his heart , to whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself ?
and the king said , who is in the court ? now haman was come into the outward court of the king ' s house , to speak unto the king to hang mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him .
and they said unto him , we have dreamed a dream , and there is no interpreter of it . and joseph said unto them , do not interpretations belong to god ? tell me them , i pray you .
that the man of god may be perfect , throughly furnished unto all good works .
all scripture is given by inspiration of god , and is profitable for doctrine , for reproof , for correction , for instruction in righteousness :
and that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures , which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in christ jesus .
but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse , deceiving , and being deceived .
persecutions , afflictions , which came unto me at antioch , at iconium , at lystra ; what persecutions i endured : but out of them all the lord delivered me .
yea , and all that will live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution .
but thou hast fully known my doctrine , manner of life , purpose , faith , longsuffering , charity , patience ,
and it came to pass after these things , that the butler of the king of egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of egypt .
and pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers , against the chief of the butlers , and against the chief of the bakers .
and he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard , into the prison , the place where joseph was bound .
and the captain of the guard charged joseph with them , and he served them : and they continued a season in ward .
and they dreamed a dream both of them , each man his dream in one night , each man according to the interpretation of his dream , the butler and the baker of the king of egypt , which were bound in the prison .
and joseph came in unto them in the morning , and looked upon them , and , behold , they were sad .
and he asked pharaoh ' s officers that were with him in the ward of his lord ' s house , saying , wherefore look ye so sadly to day ?
and israel vowed a vow unto the lord , and said , if thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand , then i will utterly destroy their cities .
and when king arad the canaanite , which dwelt in the south , heard tell that israel came by the way of the spies ; then he fought against israel , and took some of them prisoners .
and the lord sent fiery serpents among the people , and they bit the people ; and much people of israel died .
and the people spake against god , and against moses , wherefore have ye brought us up out of egypt to die in the wilderness ? for there is no bread , neither is there any water ; and our soul loatheth this light bread .
and they journeyed from mount hor by the way of the red sea , to compass the land of edom : and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way .
and the lord hearkened to the voice of israel , and delivered up the canaanites ; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities : and he called the name of the place hormah .
and moses made a serpent of brass , and put it upon a pole , and it came to pass , that if a serpent had bitten any man , when he beheld the serpent of brass , he lived .
and the lord said unto moses , make thee a fiery serpent , and set it upon a pole : and it shall come to pass , that every one that is bitten , when he looketh upon it , shall live .
therefore the people came to moses , and said , we have sinned , for we have spoken against the lord , and against thee ; pray unto the lord , that he take away the serpents from us . and moses prayed for the people .
i have fed you with milk , and not with meat : for hitherto ye were not able to bear it , neither yet now are ye able .
for ye are yet carnal : for whereas there is among you envying , and strife , and divisions , are ye not carnal , and walk as men ?
and i , brethren , could not speak unto you as unto spiritual , but as unto carnal , even as unto babes in christ .
i have planted , apollos watered ; but god gave the increase .
so then neither is he that planteth any thing , neither he that watereth ; but god that giveth the increase .
for while one saith , i am of paul ; and another , i am of apollos ; are ye not carnal ?
who then is paul , and who is apollos , but ministers by whom ye believed , even as the lord gave to every man ?
for we are labourers together with god : ye are god ' s husbandry , ye are god ' s building .
and they will salute thee , and give thee two loaves of bread ; which thou shalt receive of their hands .
now he that planteth and he that watereth are one : and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour .
and the spirit of the lord will come upon thee , and thou shalt prophesy with them , and shalt be turned into another man .
and let it be , when these signs are come unto thee , that thou do as occasion serve thee ; for god is with thee .
and thou shalt go down before me to gilgal ; and , behold , i will come down unto thee , to offer burnt offerings , and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings : seven days shalt thou tarry , till i come to thee , and shew thee what thou shalt do .
and it was so , that when he had turned his back to go from samuel , god gave him another heart : and all those signs came to pass that day .
duke aholibamah , duke elah , duke pinon ,
duke kenaz , duke teman , duke mibzar ,
and when baal - hanan was dead , hadad reigned in his stead : and the name of his city was pai ; and his wife ' s name was mehetabel , the daughter of matred , the daughter of mezahab .
hadad died also . and the dukes of edom were ; duke timnah , duke aliah , duke jetheth ,
and when shaul was dead , baal - hanan the son of achbor reigned in his stead .
and when samlah was dead , shaul of rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead .
and when hadad was dead , samlah of masrekah reigned in his stead .
and when husham was dead , hadad the son of bedad , which smote midian in the field of moab , reigned in his stead : and the name of his city was avith .
and when jobab was dead , husham of the land of the temanites reigned in his stead .
and when bela was dead , jobab the son of zerah of bozrah reigned in his stead .
now these are the kings that reigned in the land of edom before any king reigned over the children of israel ; bela the son of beor : and the name of his city was dinhabah .
nicodemus answered and said unto him , how can these things be ?
and he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of moses , which he wrote in the presence of the children of israel .
the wind bloweth where it listeth , and thou hearest the sound thereof , but canst not tell whence it cometh , and whither it goeth : so is every one that is born of the spirit .
as moses the servant of the lord commanded the children of israel , as it is written in the book of the law of moses , an altar of whole stones , over which no man hath lift up any iron : and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the lord , and sacrificed peace offerings .
marvel not that i said unto thee , ye must be born again .
and the lord said unto moses , bring aaron ' s rod again before the testimony , to be kept for a token against the rebels ; and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me , that they die not .
and afterward he read all the words of the law , the blessings and cursings , according to all that is written in the book of the law .
that which is born of the flesh is flesh ; and that which is born of the spirit is spirit .
jesus answered , verily , verily , i say unto thee , except a man be born of water and of the spirit , he cannot enter into the kingdom of god .
and the children of israel spake unto moses , saying , behold , we die , we perish , we all perish .
nicodemus saith unto him , how can a man be born when he is old ? can he enter the second time into his mother ' s womb , and be born ?
and moses did so : as the lord commanded him , so did he .
there was not a word of all that moses commanded , which joshua read not before all the congregation of israel , with the women , and the little ones , and the strangers that were conversant among them .
jesus answered and said unto him , verily , verily , i say unto thee , except a man be born again , he cannot see the kingdom of god .
the same came to jesus by night , and said unto him , rabbi , we know that thou art a teacher come from god : for no man can do these miracles that thou doest , except god be with him .
whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the lord shall die : shall we be consumed with dying ?
there was a man of the pharisees , named nicodemus , a ruler of the jews :
then joshua built an altar unto the lord god of israel in mount ebal ,
and joshua burnt ai , and made it an heap for ever , even a desolation unto this day .
duke magdiel , duke iram . these are the dukes of edom .
and the king of ai they took alive , and brought him to joshua .
and the other issued out of the city against them ; so they were in the midst of israel , some on this side , and some on that side : and they smote them , so that they let none of them remain or escape .
and when joshua and all israel saw that the ambush had taken the city , and that the smoke of the city ascended , then they turned again , and slew the men of ai .
and when the men of ai looked behind them , they saw , and , behold , the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven , and they had no power to flee this way or that way : and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers .
only the cattle and the spoil of that city israel took for a prey unto themselves , according unto the word of the lord which he commanded joshua .
for joshua drew not his hand back , wherewith he stretched out the spear , until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of ai .
and so it was , that all that fell that day , both of men and women , were twelve thousand , even all the men of ai .
yet have i set my king upon my holy hill of zion .
i will declare the decree : the lord hath said unto me , thou art my son ; this day have i begotten thee .
he that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh : the lord shall have them in derision .
then shall he speak unto them in his wrath , and vex them in his sore displeasure .
the kings of the earth set themselves , and the rulers take counsel together , against the lord , and against his anointed , saying ,
why do the heathen rage , and the people imagine a vain thing ?
but i rejoiced in the lord greatly , that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again ; wherein ye were also careful , but ye lacked opportunity .
not that i speak in respect of want : for i have learned , in whatsoever state i am , therewith to be content .
i know both how to be abased , and i know how to abound : every where and in all things i am instructed both to be full and to be hungry , both to abound and to suffer need .
i can do all things through christ which strengtheneth me .
notwithstanding ye have well done , that ye did communicate with my affliction .
now ye philippians know also , that in the beginning of the gospel , when i departed from macedonia , no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving , but ye only .
for even in thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity .
not because i desire a gift : but i desire fruit that may abound to your account .
but i have all , and abound : i am full , having received of epaphroditus the things which were sent from you , an odour of a sweet smell , a sacrifice acceptable , wellpleasing to god .
but my god shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by christ jesus .
a false witness that speaketh lies , and he that soweth discord among brethren .
an heart that deviseth wicked imaginations , feet that be swift in running to mischief ,
thou shalt break them with a rod of iron ; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter ' s vessel .
therefore shall his calamity come suddenly ; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy .
ask of me , and i shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance , and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession .
frowardness is in his heart , he deviseth mischief continually ; he soweth discord .
a proud look , a lying tongue , and hands that shed innocent blood ,
these six things doth the lord hate : yea , seven are an abomination unto him :
yet a little sleep , a little slumber , a little folding of the hands to sleep :
he winketh with his eyes , he speaketh with his feet , he teacheth with his fingers ;
a naughty person , a wicked man , walketh with a froward mouth .
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all . amen .
salute every saint in christ jesus . the brethren which are with me greet you .
all the saints salute you , chiefly they that are of caesar ' s household .
now unto god and our father be glory for ever and ever . amen .
then shalt thou go on forward from thence , and thou shalt come to the plain of tabor , and there shall meet thee three men going up to god to bethel , one carrying three kids , and another carrying three loaves of bread , and another carrying a bottle of wine :
then samuel took a vial of oil , and poured it upon his head , and kissed him , and said , is it not because the lord hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance ?
and if a man shall lie with his uncle ' s wife , he hath uncovered his uncle ' s nakedness : they shall bear their sin ; they shall die childless .
can one go upon hot coals , and his feet not be burned ?
for we know in part , and we prophesy in part .
can a man take fire in his bosom , and his clothes not be burned ?
charity never faileth : but whether there be prophecies , they shall fail ; whether there be tongues , they shall cease ; whether there be knowledge , it shall vanish away .
ye shall therefore keep all my statutes , and all my judgments , and do them : that the land , whither i bring you to dwell therein , spue you not out .
for by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread : and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life .
beareth all things , believeth all things , hopeth all things , endureth all things .
and if a man shall take his brother ' s wife , it is an unclean thing : he hath uncovered his brother ' s nakedness ; they shall be childless .
lust not after her beauty in thine heart ; neither let her take thee with her eyelids .
but i have said unto you , ye shall inherit their land , and i will give it unto you to possess it , a land that floweth with milk and honey : i am the lord your god , which have separated you from other people .
and ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation , which i cast out before you : for they committed all these things , and therefore i abhorred them .
and ye shall be holy unto me : for i the lord am holy , and have severed you from other people , that ye should be mine .
ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean , and between unclean fowls and clean : and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast , or by fowl , or by any manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground , which i have separated from you as unclean .
so he that goeth in to his neighbour ' s wife ; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent .
and though i have the gift of prophecy , and understand all mysteries , and all knowledge ; and though i have all faith , so that i could remove mountains , and have not charity , i am nothing .
my son , keep thy father ' s commandment , and forsake not the law of thy mother :
though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels , and have not charity , i am become as sounding brass , or a tinkling cymbal .
a man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit , or that is a wizard , shall surely be put to death : they shall stone them with stones : their blood shall be upon them .
rejoiceth not in iniquity , but rejoiceth in the truth ;
to keep thee from the evil woman , from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman .
doth not behave itself unseemly , seeketh not her own , is not easily provoked , thinketh no evil ;
for the commandment is a lamp ; and the law is light ; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life :
charity suffereth long , and is kind ; charity envieth not ; charity vaunteth not itself , is not puffed up ,
when thou goest , it shall lead thee ; when thou sleepest , it shall keep thee ; and when thou awakest , it shall talk with thee .
and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor , and though i give my body to be burned , and have not charity , it profiteth me nothing .
and they said unto moses , thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war which are under our charge , and there lacketh not one man of us .
and the officers which were over thousands of the host , the captains of thousands , and captains of hundreds , came near unto moses :
and the man that lieth with his father ' s wife hath uncovered his father ' s nakedness : both of them shall surely be put to death ; their blood shall be upon them .
and the man that committeth adultery with another man ' s wife , even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour ' s wife , the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death .
and if a man lie with a beast , he shall surely be put to death : and ye shall slay the beast .
and if a man take a wife and her mother , it is wickedness : they shall be burnt with fire , both he and they ; that there be no wickedness among you .
and moses and eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds , and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation , for a memorial for the children of israel before the lord .
if a man also lie with mankind , as he lieth with a woman , both of them have committed an abomination : they shall surely be put to death ; their blood shall be upon them .
and moses and eleazar the priest took the gold of them , even all wrought jewels .
and if a man lie with his daughter in law , both of them shall surely be put to death : they have wrought confusion ; their blood shall be upon them .
and all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the lord , of the captains of thousands , and of the captains of hundreds , was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels .
and thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother ' s sister , nor of thy father ' s sister : for he uncovereth his near kin : they shall bear their iniquity .
and if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness , and shall uncover her nakedness ; he hath discovered her fountain , and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood : and both of them shall be cut off from among their people .
we have therefore brought an oblation for the lord , what every man hath gotten , of jewels of gold , chains , and bracelets , rings , earrings , and tablets , to make an atonement for our souls before the lord .
but if he be found , he shall restore sevenfold ; he shall give all the substance of his house .
and if a woman approach unto any beast , and lie down thereto , thou shalt kill the woman , and the beast : they shall surely be put to death ; their blood shall be upon them .
men do not despise a thief , if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry ;
a wound and dishonour shall he get ; and his reproach shall not be wiped away .
he will not regard any ransom ; neither will he rest content , though thou givest many gifts .
for jealousy is the rage of a man : therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance .
sing unto the lord , praise ye the lord : for he hath delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers .
but , o lord of hosts , that triest the righteous , and seest the reins and the heart , let me see thy vengeance on them : for unto thee have i opened my cause .
but the lord is with me as a mighty terrible one : therefore my persecutors shall stumble , and they shall not prevail : they shall be greatly ashamed ; for they shall not prosper : their everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten .
for i heard the defaming of many , fear on every side . report , say they , and we will report it . all my familiars watched for my halting , saying , peradventure he will be enticed , and we shall prevail against him , and we shall take our revenge on him .
because he slew me not from the womb ; or that my mother might have been my grave , and her womb to be always great with me .
cursed be the day wherein i was born : let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed .
cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father , saying , a man child is born unto thee ; making him very glad .
wherefore came i forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow , that my days should be consumed with shame ?
which long for death , but it cometh not ; and dig for it more than for hid treasures ;
wherefore is light given to him that is in misery , and life unto the bitter in soul ;
i was not in safety , neither had i rest , neither was i quiet ; yet trouble came .
for the thing which i greatly feared is come upon me , and that which i was afraid of is come unto me .
for my sighing cometh before i eat , and my roarings are poured out like the waters .
why is light given to a man whose way is hid , and whom god hath hedged in ?
which rejoice exceedingly , and are glad , when they can find the grave ?
the small and great are there ; and the servant is free from his master .
and afterward offered the continual burnt offering , both of the new moons , and of all the set feasts of the lord that were consecrated , and of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the lord .
they kept also the feast of tabernacles , as it is written , and offered the daily burnt offerings by number , according to the custom , as the duty of every day required ;
they gave money also unto the masons , and to the carpenters ; and meat , and drink , and oil , unto them of zidon , and to them of tyre , to bring cedar trees from lebanon to the sea of joppa , according to the grant that they had of cyrus king of persia .
from the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings unto the lord . but the foundation of the temple of the lord was not yet laid .
and when the seventh month was come , and the children of israel were in the cities , the people gathered themselves together as one man to jerusalem .
and they set the altar upon his bases ; for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries : and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the lord , even burnt offerings morning and evening .
then stood up jeshua the son of jozadak , and his brethren the priests , and zerubbabel the son of shealtiel , and his brethren , and builded the altar of the god of israel , to offer burnt offerings thereon , as it is written in the law of moses the man of god .
masters , give unto your servants that which is just and equal ; knowing that ye also have a master in heaven .
continue in prayer , and watch in the same with thanksgiving ;
withal praying also for us , that god would open unto us a door of utterance , to speak the mystery of christ , for which i am also in bonds :
with onesimus , a faithful and beloved brother , who is one of you . they shall make known unto you all things which are done here .
whom i have sent unto you for the same purpose , that he might know your estate , and comfort your hearts ;
the burden which habakkuk the prophet did see .
all my state shall tychicus declare unto you , who is a beloved brother , and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the lord :
o lord , how long shall i cry , and thou wilt not hear ! even cry out unto thee of violence , and thou wilt not save !
let your speech be alway with grace , seasoned with salt , that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man .
why dost thou shew me iniquity , and cause me to behold grievance ? for spoiling and violence are before me : and there are that raise up strife and contention .
walk in wisdom toward them that are without , redeeming the time .
therefore the law is slacked , and judgment doth never go forth : for the wicked doth compass about the righteous ; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth .
that i may make it manifest , as i ought to speak .
behold ye among the heathen , and regard , and wonder marvellously : for i will work a work in your days , which ye will not believe , though it be told you .
for , lo , i raise up the chaldeans , that bitter and hasty nation , which shall march through the breadth of the land , to possess the dwellingplaces that are not theirs .
they are terrible and dreadful : their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves .
their horses also are swifter than the leopards , and are more fierce than the evening wolves : and their horsemen shall spread themselves , and their horsemen shall come from far ; they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat .
they shall come all for violence : their faces shall sup up as the east wind , and they shall gather the captivity as the sand .
now these are thy servants and thy people , whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power , and by thy strong hand .
and all the people , even the people of war that were with him , went up , and drew nigh , and came before the city , and pitched on the north side of ai : now there was a valley between them and ai .
and he took about five thousand men , and set them to lie in ambush between bethel and ai , on the west side of the city .
and joshua rose up early in the morning , and numbered the people , and went up , he and the elders of israel , before the people to ai .
and joshua and all israel made as if they were beaten before them , and fled by the way of the wilderness .
and all the people that were in ai were called together to pursue after them : and they pursued after joshua , and were drawn away from the city .
and when they had set the people , even all the host that was on the north of the city , and their liers in wait on the west of the city , joshua went that night into the midst of the valley .
and the ambush arose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand : and they entered into the city , and took it , and hasted and set the city on fire .
and there was not a man left in ai or bethel , that went not out after israel : and they left the city open , and pursued after israel .
and the lord said unto joshua , stretch out the spear that is in thy hand toward ai ; for i will give it into thine hand . and joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city .
his watchmen are blind : they are all ignorant , they are all dumb dogs , they cannot bark ; sleeping , lying down , loving to slumber .
yea , they are greedy dogs which can never have enough , and they are shepherds that cannot understand : they all look to their own way , every one for his gain , from his quarter .
come ye , say they , i will fetch wine , and we will fill ourselves with strong drink ; and to morrow shall be as this day , and much more abundant .
why died i not from the womb ? why did i not give up the ghost when i came out of the belly ?
why did the knees prevent me ? or why the breasts that i should suck ?
for now should i have lain still and been quiet , i should have slept : then had i been at rest ,
with kings and counsellers of the earth , which built desolate places for themselves ;
or with princes that had gold , who filled their houses with silver :
or as an hidden untimely birth i had not been ; as infants which never saw light .
there the wicked cease from troubling ; and there the weary be at rest .
there the prisoners rest together ; they hear not the voice of the oppressor .
then stood jeshua with his sons and his brethren , kadmiel and his sons , the sons of judah , together , to set forward the workmen in the house of god : the sons of henadad , with their sons and their brethren the levites .
because it shut not up the doors of my mother ' s womb , nor hid sorrow from mine eyes .
and solomon did evil in the sight of the lord , and went not fully after the lord , as did david his father .
for while they be folden together as thorns , and while they are drunken as drunkards , they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry .
for solomon went after ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonians , and after milcom the abomination of the ammonites .
for it came to pass , when solomon was old , that his wives turned away his heart after other gods : and his heart was not perfect with the lord his god , as was the heart of david his father .
thus saith the lord : though they be quiet , and likewise many , yet thus shall they be cut down , when he shall pass through . though i have afflicted thee , i will afflict thee no more .
and he had seven hundred wives , princesses , and three hundred concubines : and his wives turned away his heart .
there is one come out of thee , that imagineth evil against the lord , a wicked counseller .
and the lord hath given a commandment concerning thee , that no more of thy name be sown : out of the house of thy gods will i cut off the graven image and the molten image : i will make thy grave ; for thou art vile .
and the lord was angry with solomon , because his heart was turned from the lord god of israel , which had appeared unto him twice ,
for now will i break his yoke from off thee , and will burst thy bonds in sunder .
and likewise did he for all his strange wives , which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods .
then did solomon build an high place for chemosh , the abomination of moab , in the hill that is before jerusalem , and for molech , the abomination of the children of ammon .
behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings , that publisheth peace ! o judah , keep thy solemn feasts , perform thy vows : for the wicked shall no more pass through thee ; he is utterly cut off .
but king solomon loved many strange women , together with the daughter of pharaoh , women of the moabites , ammonites , edomites , zidonians , and hittites ;
of the nations concerning which the lord said unto the children of israel , ye shall not go in to them , neither shall they come in unto you : for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods : solomon clave unto these in love .
and they were both naked , the man and his wife , and were not ashamed .
therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother , and shall cleave unto his wife : and they shall be one flesh .
and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept : and he took one of his ribs , and closed up the flesh instead thereof ;
and adam gave names to all cattle , and to the fowl of the air , and to every beast of the field ; but for adam there was not found an help meet for him .
and adam said , this is now bone of my bones , and flesh of my flesh : she shall be called woman , because she was taken out of man .
and the rib , which the lord god had taken from man , made he a woman , and brought her unto the man .
now in the eighteenth year of his reign , when he had purged the land , and the house , he sent shaphan the son of azaliah , and maaseiah the governor of the city , and joah the son of joahaz the recorder , to repair the house of the lord his god .
woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock ! the sword shall be upon his arm , and upon his right eye : his arm shall be clean dried up , and his right eye shall be utterly darkened .
and when he had broken down the altars and the groves , and had beaten the graven images into powder , and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of israel , he returned to jerusalem .
and so did he in the cities of manasseh , and ephraim , and simeon , even unto naphtali , with their mattocks round about .
and the lord said unto me , take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd .
and he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars , and cleansed judah and jerusalem .
for in the eighth year of his reign , while he was yet young , he began to seek after the god of david his father : and in the twelfth year he began to purge judah and jerusalem from the high places , and the groves , and the carved images , and the molten images .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord , and walked in the ways of david his father , and declined neither to the right hand , nor to the left .
josiah was eight years old when he began to reign , and he reigned in jerusalem one and thirty years .
and i took my staff , even beauty , and cut it assunder , that i might break my covenant which i had made with all the people .
and the lord said unto me , cast it unto the potter : a goodly price that i was prised at of them . and i took the thirty pieces of silver , and cast them to the potter in the house of the lord .
then i cut asunder mine other staff , even bands , that i might break the brotherhood between judah and israel .
and it was broken in that day : and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it was the word of the lord .
and i said unto them , if ye think good , give me my price ; and if not , forbear . so they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver .
but i suffer not a woman to teach , nor to usurp authority over the man , but to be in silence .
let the woman learn in silence with all subjection .
for adam was first formed , then eve .
notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing , if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety .
but ( which becometh women professing godliness ) with good works .
for we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly , working not at all , but are busybodies .
for even when we were with you , this we commanded you , that if any would not work , neither should he eat .
and if any man obey not our word by this epistle , note that man , and have no company with him , that he may be ashamed .
yet count him not as an enemy , but admonish him as a brother .
now them that are such we command and exhort by our lord jesus christ , that with quietness they work , and eat their own bread .
but ye , brethren , be not weary in well doing .
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all . amen .
now the lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means . the lord be with you all .
and jehoash the king of israel sent to amaziah king of judah , saying , the thistle that was in lebanon sent to the cedar that was in lebanon , saying , give thy daughter to my son to wife : and there passed by a wild beast that was in lebanon , and trode down the thistle .
then amaziah sent messengers to jehoash , the son of jehoahaz son of jehu , king of israel , saying , come , let us look one another in the face .
he slew of edom in the valley of salt ten thousand , and took selah by war , and called the name of it joktheel unto this day .
howbeit the high places were not taken away : as yet the people did sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord , yet not like david his father : he did according to all things as joash his father did .
he was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and reigned twenty and nine years in jerusalem . and his mother ' s name was jehoaddan of jerusalem .
in the second year of joash son of jehoahaz king of israel reigned amaziah the son of joash king of judah .
but that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected , and is nigh unto cursing ; whose end is to be burned .
for the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it , and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed , receiveth blessing from god :
if they shall fall away , to renew them again unto repentance ; seeing they crucify to themselves the son of god afresh , and put him to an open shame .
and have tasted the good word of god , and the powers of the world to come ,
for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened , and have tasted of the heavenly gift , and were made partakers of the holy ghost ,
and this will we do , if god permit .
of the doctrine of baptisms , and of laying on of hands , and of resurrection of the dead , and of eternal judgment .
therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ , let us go on unto perfection ; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works , and of faith toward god ,
while the king sitteth at his table , my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof .
thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels , thy neck with chains of gold .
we will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver .
behold , thou art fair , my beloved , yea , pleasant : also our bed is green .
the beams of our house are cedar , and our rafters of fir .
my beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of en - gedi .
behold , thou art fair , my love ; behold , thou art fair ; thou hast doves ' eyes .
the name of the first is pison : that is it which compasseth the whole land of havilah , where there is gold ;
and the gold of that land is good : there is bdellium and the onyx stone .
and a river went out of eden to water the garden ; and from thence it was parted , and became into four heads .
and the lord god took the man , and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it .
and the lord god commanded the man , saying , of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat :
and the name of the second river is gihon : the same is it that compasseth the whole land of ethiopia .
and the name of the third river is hiddekel : that is it which goeth toward the east of assyria . and the fourth river is euphrates .
and out of the ground the lord god formed every beast of the field , and every fowl of the air ; and brought them unto adam to see what he would call them : and whatsoever adam called every living creature , that was the name thereof .
but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil , thou shalt not eat of it : for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die .
and the lord god said , it is not good that the man should be alone ; i will make him an help meet for him .
and it came to pass , that while he executed the priest ' s office before god in the order of his course ,
and they had no child , because that elisabeth was barren , and they both were now well stricken in years .
and they were both righteous before god , walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the lord blameless .
there was in the days of herod , the king of judaea , a certain priest named zacharias , of the course of abia : and his wife was of the daughters of aaron , and her name was elisabeth .
forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us ,
even as they delivered them unto us , which from the beginning were eyewitnesses , and ministers of the word ;
it seemed good to me also , having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first , to write unto thee in order , most excellent theophilus ,
that thou mightest know the certainty of those things , wherein thou hast been instructed .
knowing this , that the law is not made for a righteous man , but for the lawless and disobedient , for the ungodly and for sinners , for unholy and profane , for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers , for manslayers ,
desiring to be teachers of the law ; understanding neither what they say , nor whereof they affirm .
but we know that the law is good , if a man use it lawfully ;
now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart , and of a good conscience , and of faith unfeigned :
from which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling ;
as i besought thee to abide still at ephesus , when i went into macedonia , that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine ,
neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies , which minister questions , rather than godly edifying which is in faith : so do .
paul , an apostle of jesus christ by the commandment of god our saviour , and lord jesus christ , which is our hope ;
unto timothy , my own son in the faith : grace , mercy , and peace , from god our father and jesus christ our lord .
and i will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity ; and i will bring upon them , and upon the inhabitants of jerusalem , and upon the men of judah , all the evil that i have pronounced against them ; but they hearkened not .
then took jeremiah another roll , and gave it to baruch the scribe , the son of neriah ; who wrote therein from the mouth of jeremiah all the words of the book which jehoiakim king of judah had burned in the fire : and there were added besides unto them many like words .
therefore thus saith the lord of jehoiakim king of judah ; he shall have none to sit upon the throne of david : and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat , and in the night to the frost .
as a dog returneth to his vomit , so a fool returneth to his folly .
the slothful man saith , there is a lion in the way ; a lion is in the streets .
seest thou a man wise in his own conceit ? there is more hope of a fool than of him .
the sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason .
he that passeth by , and meddleth with strife belonging not to him , is like one that taketh a dog by the ears .
for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect , by reason of the glory that excelleth .
as the door turneth upon his hinges , so doth the slothful upon his bed .
for if that which is done away was glorious , much more that which remaineth is glorious .
the slothful hideth his hand in his bosom ; it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth .
as a mad man who casteth firebrands , arrows , and death ,
so is the man that deceiveth his neighbour , and saith , am not i in sport ?
how that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality .
nevertheless when it shall turn to the lord , the vail shall be taken away .
for to their power , i bear record , yea , and beyond their power they were willing of themselves ;
now the lord is that spirit : and where the spirit of the lord is , there is liberty .
praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift , and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints .
but we all , with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord , are changed into the same image from glory to glory , even as by the spirit of the lord .
and this they did , not as we hoped , but first gave their own selves to the lord , and unto us by the will of god .
insomuch that we desired titus , that as he had begun , so he would also finish in you the same grace also .
seeing then that we have such hope , we use great plainness of speech :
therefore , as ye abound in every thing , in faith , and utterance , and knowledge , and in all diligence , and in your love to us , see that ye abound in this grace also .
and not as moses , which put a vail over his face , that the children of israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished :
i speak not by commandment , but by occasion of the forwardness of others , and to prove the sincerity of your love .
but their minds were blinded : for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament ; which vail is done away in christ .
for ye know the grace of our lord jesus christ , that , though he was rich , yet for your sakes he became poor , that ye through his poverty might be rich .
but even unto this day , when moses is read , the vail is upon their heart .
and esther said , the adversary and enemy is this wicked haman . then haman was afraid before the king and the queen .
then the king ahasuerus answered and said unto esther the queen , who is he , and where is he , that durst presume in his heart to do so ?
for we are sold , i and my people , to be destroyed , to be slain , and to perish . but if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen , i had held my tongue , although the enemy could not countervail the king ' s damage .
then esther the queen answered and said , if i have found favour in thy sight , o king , and if it please the king , let my life be given me at my petition , and my people at my request :
and harbonah , one of the chamberlains , said before the king , behold also , the gallows fifty cubits high , which haman had made for mordecai , who had spoken good for the king , standeth in the house of haman . then the king said , hang him thereon .
and the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace garden : and haman stood up to make request for his life to esther the queen ; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king .
where no wood is , there the fire goeth out : so where there is no talebearer , the strife ceaseth .
and the king said again unto esther on the second day at the banquet of wine , what is thy petition , queen esther ? and it shall be granted thee : and what is thy request ? and it shall be performed , even to the half of the kingdom .
he that hateth dissembleth with his lips , and layeth up deceit within him ;
so the king and haman came to banquet with esther the queen .
burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered with silver dross .
the words of a talebearer are as wounds , and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly .
as coals are to burning coals , and wood to fire ; so is a contentious man to kindle strife .
and it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled ; and he sent and called for all the magicians of egypt , and all the wise men thereof : and pharaoh told them his dream ; but there was none that could interpret them unto pharaoh .
and the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears . and pharaoh awoke , and , behold , it was a dream .
then spake the chief butler unto pharaoh , saying , i do remember my faults this day :
and , behold , seven other kine came up after them out of the river , ill favoured and leanfleshed ; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river .
and the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine . so pharaoh awoke .
and he slept and dreamed the second time : and , behold , seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk , rank and good .
and , behold , seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them .
and it came to pass at the end of two full years , that pharaoh dreamed : and , behold , he stood by the river .
and , behold , there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed ; and they fed in a meadow .
and god came unto balaam , and said , what men are these with thee ?
and he said unto them , lodge here this night , and i will bring you word again , as the lord shall speak unto me : and the princes of moab abode with balaam .
and the elders of moab and the elders of midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand ; and they came unto balaam , and spake unto him the words of balak .
and moab said unto the elders of midian , now shall this company lick up all that are round about us , as the ox licketh up the grass of the field . and balak the son of zippor was king of the moabites at that time .
and moab was sore afraid of the people , because they were many : and moab was distressed because of the children of israel .
and balak the son of zippor saw all that israel had done to the amorites .
and the children of israel set forward , and pitched in the plains of moab on this side jordan by jericho .
for yet a little while , and the wicked shall not be : yea , thou shalt diligently consider his place , and it shall not be .
the wicked plotteth against the just , and gnasheth upon him with his teeth .
but the meek shall inherit the earth ; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace .
but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery , even the hidden wisdom , which god ordained before the world unto our glory :
many there be which say of my soul , there is no help for him in god . selah .
which none of the princes of this world knew : for had they known it , they would not have crucified the lord of glory .
lord , how are they increased that trouble me ! many are they that rise up against me .
that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men , but in the power of god .
howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect : yet not the wisdom of this world , nor of the princes of this world , that come to nought :
and i was with you in weakness , and in fear , and in much trembling .
i will not be afraid of ten thousands of people , that have set themselves against me round about .
and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man ' s wisdom , but in demonstration of the spirit and of power :
i laid me down and slept ; i awaked ; for the lord sustained me .
and i , brethren , when i came to you , came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom , declaring unto you the testimony of god .
with all his reign and his might , and the times that went over him , and over israel , and over all the kingdoms of the countries .
i cried unto the lord with my voice , and he heard me out of his holy hill . selah .
for i determined not to know any thing among you , save jesus christ , and him crucified .
but thou , o lord , art a shield for me ; my glory , and the lifter up of mine head .
the lord shall laugh at him : for he seeth that his day is coming .
the wicked have drawn out the sword , and have bent their bow , to cast down the poor and needy , and to slay such as be of upright conversation .
their sword shall enter into their own heart , and their bows shall be broken .
a little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked .
for the arms of the wicked shall be broken : but the lord upholdeth the righteous .
the lord knoweth the days of the upright : and their inheritance shall be for ever .
and the rest , some on boards , and some on broken pieces of the ship . and so it came to pass , that they escaped all safe to land .
they shall not be ashamed in the evil time : and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied .
but the centurion , willing to save paul , kept them from their purpose ; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea , and get to land :
the steps of a good man are ordered by the lord : and he delighteth in his way .
the wicked borroweth , and payeth not again : but the righteous sheweth mercy , and giveth .
but the wicked shall perish , and the enemies of the lord shall be as the fat of lambs : they shall consume ; into smoke shall they consume away .
arise , o lord ; save me , o my god : for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone ; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly .
salvation belongeth unto the lord : thy blessing is upon thy people . selah .
but as it is written , eye hath not seen , nor ear heard , neither have entered into the heart of man , the things which god hath prepared for them that love him .
he is ever merciful , and lendeth ; and his seed is blessed .
depart from evil , and do good ; and dwell for evermore .
though he fall , he shall not be utterly cast down : for the lord upholdeth him with his hand .
i have been young , and now am old ; yet have i not seen the righteous forsaken , nor his seed begging bread .
for the lord loveth judgment , and forsaketh not his saints ; they are preserved for ever : but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off .
the righteous shall inherit the land , and dwell therein for ever .
o lord god of abraham , isaac , and of israel , our fathers , keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people , and prepare their heart unto thee :
the wicked watcheth the righteous , and seeketh to slay him .
and give unto solomon my son a perfect heart , to keep thy commandments , thy testimonies , and thy statutes , and to do all these things , and to build the palace , for the which i have made provision .
the law of his god is in his heart ; none of his steps shall slide .
o lord our god , all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand , and is all thine own .
wait on the lord , and keep his way , and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land : when the wicked are cut off , thou shalt see it .
i know also , my god , that thou triest the heart , and hast pleasure in uprightness . as for me , in the uprightness of mine heart i have willingly offered all these things : and now have i seen with joy thy people , which are present here , to offer willingly unto thee .
the lord will not leave him in his hand , nor condemn him when he is judged .
paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers , except these abide in the ship , ye cannot be saved .
the mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom , and his tongue talketh of judgment .
wherefore david blessed the lord before all the congregation : and david said , blessed be thou , lord god of israel our father , for ever and ever .
the land also shall be left of them , and shall enjoy her sabbaths , while she lieth desolate without them : and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity : because , even because they despised my judgments , and because their soul abhorred my statutes .
thine , o lord , is the greatness , and the power , and the glory , and the victory , and the majesty : for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine ; thine is the kingdom , o lord , and thou art exalted as head above all .
and yet for all that , when they be in the land of their enemies , i will not cast them away , neither will i abhor them , to destroy them utterly , and to break my covenant with them : for i am the lord their god .
but i will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors , whom i brought forth out of the land of egypt in the sight of the heathen , that i might be their god : i am the lord .
these are the statutes and judgments and laws , which the lord made between him and the children of israel in mount sinai by the hand of moses .
but who am i , and what is my people , that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort ? for all things come of thee , and of thine own have we given thee .
for we are strangers before thee , and sojourners , as were all our fathers : our days on the earth are as a shadow , and there is none abiding .
if they shall confess their iniquity , and the iniquity of their fathers , with their trespass which they trespassed against me , and that also they have walked contrary unto me ;
both riches and honour come of thee , and thou reignest over all ; and in thine hand is power and might ; and in thine hand it is to make great , and to give strength unto all .
and that i also have walked contrary unto them , and have brought them into the land of their enemies ; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled , and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity :
now therefore , our god , we thank thee , and praise thy glorious name .
then will i remember my covenant with jacob , and also my covenant with isaac , and also my covenant with abraham will i remember ; and i will remember the land .
and he must needs go through samaria .
he left judaea , and departed again into galilee .
( though jesus himself baptized not , but his disciples , )
then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks , they cast four anchors out of the stern , and wished for the day .
when therefore the lord knew how the pharisees had heard that jesus made and baptized more disciples than john ,
( for his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat . )
there cometh a woman of samaria to draw water : jesus saith unto her , give me to drink .
for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom ; to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit ;
now jacob ' s well was there . jesus therefore , being wearied with his journey , sat thus on the well : and it was about the sixth hour .
to another faith by the same spirit ; to another the gifts of healing by the same spirit ;
then cometh he to a city of samaria , which is called sychar , near to the parcel of ground that jacob gave to his son joseph .
and there are diversities of operations , but it is the same god which worketh all in all .
but the salvation of the righteous is of the lord : he is their strength in the time of trouble .
but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit withal .
for there stood by me this night the angel of god , whose i am , and whom i serve ,
now there are diversities of gifts , but the same spirit .
and now i exhort you to be of good cheer : for there shall be no loss of any man ' s life among you , but of the ship .
and there are differences of administrations , but the same lord .
but after long abstinence paul stood forth in the midst of them , and said , sirs , ye should have hearkened unto me , and not have loosed from crete , and to have gained this harm and loss .
then saith the woman of samaria unto him , how is it that thou , being a jew , askest drink of me , which am a woman of samaria ? for the jews have no dealings with the samaritans .
ye know that ye were gentiles , carried away unto these dumb idols , even as ye were led .
and sounded , and found it twenty fathoms : and when they had gone a little further , they sounded again , and found it fifteen fathoms .
i have seen the wicked in great power , and spreading himself like a green bay tree .
a lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it ; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin .
but when the fourteenth night was come , as we were driven up and down in adria , about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country ;
yet he passed away , and , lo , he was not : yea , i sought him , but he could not be found .
whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein : and he that rolleth a stone , it will return upon him .
howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island .
mark the perfect man , and behold the upright : for the end of that man is peace .
whose hatred is covered by deceit , his wickedness shall be shewed before the whole congregation .
now concerning spiritual gifts , brethren , i would not have you ignorant .
wherefore , sirs , be of good cheer : for i believe god , that it shall be even as it was told me .
but the transgressors shall be destroyed together : the end of the wicked shall be cut off .
when he speaketh fair , believe him not : for there are seven abominations in his heart .
and the time that he reigned over israel was forty years ; seven years reigned he in hebron , and thirty and three years reigned he in jerusalem .
and he died in a good old age , full of days , riches , and honour : and solomon his son reigned in his stead .
now the acts of david the king , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of samuel the seer , and in the book of nathan the prophet , and in the book of gad the seer ,
and when they had taken up the anchors , they committed themselves unto the sea , and loosed the rudder bands , and hoised up the mainsail to the wind , and made toward shore .
and the lord shall help them and deliver them : he shall deliver them from the wicked , and save them , because they trust in him .
and falling into a place where two seas met , they ran the ship aground ; and the forepart stuck fast , and remained unmoveable , but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves .
and the soldiers ' counsel was to kill the prisoners , lest any of them should swim out , and escape .
then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths , as long as it lieth desolate , and ye be in your enemies ' land ; even then shall the land rest , and enjoy her sabbaths .
if a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie , saying , i will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink ; he shall even be the prophet of this people .
and david said to all the congregation , now bless the lord your god . and all the congregation blessed the lord god of their fathers , and bowed down their heads , and worshipped the lord , and the king .
as long as it lieth desolate it shall rest ; because it did not rest in your sabbaths , when ye dwelt upon it .
arise ye , and depart ; for this is not your rest : because it is polluted , it shall destroy you , even with a sore destruction .
and they sacrificed sacrifices unto the lord , and offered burnt offerings unto the lord , on the morrow after that day , even a thousand bullocks , a thousand rams , and a thousand lambs , with their drink offerings , and sacrifices in abundance for all israel :
and i will bring the land into desolation : and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it .
and did eat and drink before the lord on that day with great gladness . and they made solomon the son of david king the second time , and anointed him unto the lord to be the chief governor , and zadok to be priest .
and i will scatter you among the heathen , and will draw out a sword after you : and your land shall be desolate , and your cities waste .
then solomon sat on the throne of the lord as king instead of david his father , and prospered ; and all israel obeyed him .
and i will destroy your high places , and cut down your images , and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols , and my soul shall abhor you .
and all the princes , and the mighty men , and all the sons likewise of king david , submitted themselves unto solomon the king .
and i will make your cities waste , and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation , and i will not smell the savour of your sweet odours .
and the lord magnified solomon exceedingly in the sight of all israel , and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in israel .
thus david the son of jesse reigned over all israel .
and joshua said , hereby ye shall know that the living god is among you , and that he will without fail drive out from before you the canaanites , and the hittites , and the hivites , and the perizzites , and the girgashites , and the amorites , and the jebusites .
behold , the ark of the covenant of the lord of all the earth passeth over before you into jordan .
and they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies ' lands ; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them .
and ye shall perish among the heathen , and the land of your enemies shall eat you up .
and they shall fall one upon another , as it were before a sword , when none pursueth : and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies .
i will surely assemble , o jacob , all of thee ; i will surely gather the remnant of israel ; i will put them together as the sheep of bozrah , as the flock in the midst of their fold : they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men .
and upon them that are left alive of you i will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies ; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them ; and they shall flee , as fleeing from a sword ; and they shall fall when none pursueth .
the breaker is come up before them : they have broken up , and have passed through the gate , and are gone out by it : and their king shall pass before them , and the lord on the head of them .
and while the day was coming on , paul besought them all to take meat , saying , this day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting , having taken nothing .
then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat , and let her fall off .
and when he had thus spoken , he took bread , and gave thanks to god in presence of them all : and when he had broken it , he began to eat .
that the waters which came down from above stood and rose up upon an heap very far from the city adam , that is beside zaretan : and those that came down toward the sea of the plain , even the salt sea , failed , and were cut off : and the people passed over right against jericho .
wherefore i pray you to take some meat : for this is for your health : for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you .
and the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of jordan , and all the israelites passed over on dry ground , until all the people were passed clean over jordan .
and we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls .
and it came to pass , when the people removed from their tents , to pass over jordan , and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people ;
then were they all of good cheer , and they also took some meat .
and as they that bare the ark were come unto jordan , and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water , ( for jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest , )
and when it was day , they knew not the land : but they discovered a certain creek with a shore , into the which they were minded , if it were possible , to thrust in the ship .
now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of israel , out of every tribe a man .
and when they had eaten enough , they lightened the ship , and cast out the wheat into the sea .
and your strength shall be spent in vain : for your land shall not yield her increase , neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits .
i will also send wild beasts among you , which shall rob you of your children , and destroy your cattle , and make you few in number ; and your highways shall be desolate .
and if ye walk contrary unto me , and will not hearken unto me ; i will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins .
then will i also walk contrary unto you , and will punish you yet seven times for your sins .
and if ye will not be reformed by me by these things , but will walk contrary unto me ;
and i will bring a sword upon you , that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant : and when ye are gathered together within your cities , i will send the pestilence among you ; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy .
and when i have broken the staff of your bread , ten women shall bake your bread in one oven , and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight : and ye shall eat , and not be satisfied .
and if ye will not for all this hearken unto me , but walk contrary unto me ;
then i will walk contrary unto you also in fury ; and i , even i , will chastise you seven times for your sins .
and ye shall eat the flesh of your sons , and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat .
i am the lord your god , which brought you forth out of the land of egypt , that ye should not be their bondmen ; and i have broken the bands of your yoke , and made you go upright .
and i will walk among you , and will be your god , and ye shall be my people .
and i will set my tabernacle among you : and my soul shall not abhor you .
and ye shall eat old store , and bring forth the old because of the new .
and when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared , and no small tempest lay on us , all hope that we should be saved was then taken away .
but not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind , called euroclydon .
and when the ship was caught , and could not bear up into the wind , we let her drive .
and running under a certain island which is called clauda , we had much work to come by the boat :
which when they had taken up , they used helps , undergirding the ship ; and , fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands , strake sail , and so were driven .
and said unto them , sirs , i perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage , not only of the lading and ship , but also of our lives .
nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship , more than those things which were spoken by paul .
and because the haven was not commodious to winter in , the more part advised to depart thence also , if by any means they might attain to phenice , and there to winter ; which is an haven of crete , and lieth toward the south west and north west .
and when the south wind blew softly , supposing that they had obtained their purpose , loosing thence , they sailed close by crete .
i also will do this unto you ; i will even appoint over you terror , consumption , and the burning ague , that shall consume the eyes , and cause sorrow of heart : and ye shall sow your seed in vain , for your enemies shall eat it .
and i will set my face against you , and ye shall be slain before your enemies : they that hate you shall reign over you ; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you .
but if ye will not hearken unto me , and will not do all these commandments ;
and if ye shall despise my statutes , or if your soul abhor my judgments , so that ye will not do all my commandments , but that ye break my covenant :
and we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest , the next day they lightened the ship ;
and the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship .
then said the princes unto baruch , go , hide thee , thou and jeremiah ; and let no man know where ye be .
lie not one to another , seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds ;
when michaiah the son of gemariah , the son of shaphan , had heard out of the book all the words of the lord ,
then michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard , when baruch read the book in the ears of the people .
mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth ; fornication , uncleanness , inordinate affection , evil concupiscence , and covetousness , which is idolatry :
now it came to pass , when they had heard all the words , they were afraid both one and other , and said unto baruch , we will surely tell the king of all these words .
for which things ' sake the wrath of god cometh on the children of disobedience :
and they said unto him , sit down now , and read it in our ears . so baruch read it in their ears .
in the which ye also walked some time , when ye lived in them .
then baruch answered them , he pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth , and i wrote them with ink in the book .
but now ye also put off all these ; anger , wrath , malice , blasphemy , filthy communication out of your mouth .
and they asked baruch , saying , tell us now , how didst thou write all these words at his mouth ?
then read baruch in the book the words of jeremiah in the house of the lord , in the chamber of gemariah the son of shaphan the scribe , in the higher court , at the entry of the new gate of the lord ' s house , in the ears of all the people .
when christ , who is our life , shall appear , then shall ye also appear with him in glory .
for ye are dead , and your life is hid with christ in god .
set your affection on things above , not on things on the earth .
if ye then be risen with christ , seek those things which are above , where christ sitteth on the right hand of god .
nevertheless elnathan and delaiah and gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll : but he would not hear them .
yet they were not afraid , nor rent their garments , neither the king , nor any of his servants that heard all these words .
and it came to pass , that when jehudi had read three or four leaves , he cut it with the penknife , and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth , until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth .
now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month : and there was a fire on the hearth burning before him .
and thou shalt say to jehoiakim the king of judah , thus saith the lord ; thou hast burned this roll , saying , why hast thou written therein , saying , the king of babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land , and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast ?
take thee again another roll , and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll , which jehoiakim the king of judah hath burned .
then the word of the lord came to jeremiah , after that the king had burned the roll , and the words which baruch wrote at the mouth of jeremiah , saying ,
but the king commanded jerahmeel the son of hammelech , and seraiah the son of azriel , and shelemiah the son of abdeel , to take baruch the scribe and jeremiah the prophet : but the lord hid them .
so the king sent jehudi to fetch the roll : and he took it out of elishama the scribe ' s chamber . and jehudi read it in the ears of the king , and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king .
and they went in to the king into the court , but they laid up the roll in the chamber of elishama the scribe , and told all the words in the ears of the king .
and said to his servant , go up now , look toward the sea . and he went up , and looked , and said , there is nothing . and he said , go again seven times .
so ahab went up to eat and to drink . and elijah went up to the top of carmel ; and he cast himself down upon the earth , and put his face between his knees ,
and elijah said unto ahab , get thee up , eat and drink ; for there is a sound of abundance of rain .
and elijah said unto them , take the prophets of baal ; let not one of them escape . and they took them : and elijah brought them down to the brook kishon , and slew them there .
thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of moses and aaron .
and the hand of the lord was on elijah ; and he girded up his loins , and ran before ahab to the entrance of jezreel .
and it came to pass in the mean while , that the heaven was black with clouds and wind , and there was a great rain . and ahab rode , and went to jezreel .
and it came to pass at the seventh time , that he said , behold , there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea , like a man ' s hand . and he said , go up , say unto ahab , prepare thy chariot , and get thee down , that the rain stop thee not .
and when all the people saw it , they fell on their faces : and they said , the lord , he is the god ; the lord , he is the god .
hear me , o lord , hear me , that this people may know that thou art the lord god , and that thou hast turned their heart back again .
then the fire of the lord fell , and consumed the burnt sacrifice , and the wood , and the stones , and the dust , and licked up the water that was in the trench .
the voice of thy thunder was in the heaven : the lightnings lightened the world : the earth trembled and shook .
the clouds poured out water : the skies sent out a sound : thine arrows also went abroad .
thy way is in the sea , and thy path in the great waters , and thy footsteps are not known .
and elijah said unto all the people , come near unto me . and all the people came near unto him . and he repaired the altar of the lord that was broken down .
and i said , this is my infirmity : but i will remember the years of the right hand of the most high .
and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the lord : and he made a trench about the altar , as great as would contain two measures of seed .
i will meditate also of all thy work , and talk of thy doings .
and elijah took twelve stones , according to the number of the tribes of the sons of jacob , unto whom the word of the lord came , saying , israel shall be thy name :
i will remember the works of the lord : surely i will remember thy wonders of old .
and he said , do it the second time . and they did it the second time . and he said , do it the third time . and they did it the third time .
thou art the god that doest wonders : thou hast declared thy strength among the people .
thy way , o god , is in the sanctuary : who is so great a god as our god ?
the waters saw thee , o god , the waters saw thee ; they were afraid : the depths also were troubled .
and the water ran round about the altar ; and he filled the trench also with water .
thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people , the sons of jacob and joseph . selah .
and they took the bullock which was given them , and they dressed it , and called on the name of baal from morning even until noon , saying , o baal , hear us . but there was no voice , nor any that answered . and they leaped upon the altar which was made .
and it came to pass at noon , that elijah mocked them , and said , cry aloud : for he is a god ; either he is talking , or he is pursuing , or he is in a journey , or peradventure he sleepeth , and must be awaked .
and they cried aloud , and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets , till the blood gushed out upon them .
and it came to pass , when midday was past , and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice , that there was neither voice , nor any to answer , nor any that regarded .
and call ye on the name of your gods , and i will call on the name of the lord : and the god that answereth by fire , let him be god . and all the people answered and said , it is well spoken .
and elijah said unto the prophets of baal , choose you one bullock for yourselves , and dress it first ; for ye are many ; and call on the name of your gods , but put no fire under .
then said elijah unto the people , i , even i only , remain a prophet of the lord ; but baal ' s prophets are four hundred and fifty men .
let them therefore give us two bullocks ; and let them choose one bullock for themselves , and cut it in pieces , and lay it on wood , and put no fire under : and i will dress the other bullock , and lay it on wood , and put no fire under :
so ahab sent unto all the children of israel , and gathered the prophets together unto mount carmel .
and elijah came unto all the people , and said , how long halt ye between two opinions ? if the lord be god , follow him : but if baal , then follow him . and the people answered him not a word .
man that is in honour , and understandeth not , is like the beasts that perish .
now therefore send , and gather to me all israel unto mount carmel , and the prophets of baal four hundred and fifty , and the prophets of the groves four hundred , which eat at jezebel ' s table .
and he answered , i have not troubled israel ; but thou , and thy father ' s house , in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the lord , and thou hast followed baalim .
so obadiah went to meet ahab , and told him : and ahab went to meet elijah .
and elijah said , as the lord of hosts liveth , before whom i stand , i will surely shew myself unto him to day .
was it not told my lord what i did when jezebel slew the prophets of the lord , how i hid an hundred men of the lord ' s prophets by fifty in a cave , and fed them with bread and water ?
and now thou sayest , go , tell thy lord , behold , elijah is here : and he shall slay me .
as the lord thy god liveth , there is no nation or kingdom , whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee : and when they said , he is not there ; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation , that they found thee not .
this their way is their folly : yet their posterity approve their sayings . selah .
nevertheless man being in honour abideth not : he is like the beasts that perish .
their inward thought is , that their houses shall continue for ever , and their dwelling places to all generations ; they call their lands after their own names .
for he seeth that wise men die , likewise the fool and the brutish person perish , and leave their wealth to others .
be not thou afraid when one is made rich , when the glory of his house is increased ;
like sheep they are laid in the grave ; death shall feed on them ; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning ; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling .
but god will redeem my soul from the power of the grave : for he shall receive me . selah .
though while he lived he blessed his soul : and men will praise thee , when thou doest well to thyself .
he shall go to the generation of his fathers ; they shall never see light .
now these are the children of the province that went up out of the captivity , of those which had been carried away , whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon had carried away unto babylon , and came again unto jerusalem and judah , every one unto his city ;
which came with zerubbabel : jeshua , nehemiah , seraiah , reelaiah , mordecai , bilshan , mispar , bigvai , rehum , baanah . the number of the men of the people of israel :
the children of shephatiah , three hundred seventy and two .
the children of arah , seven hundred seventy and five .
the children of pahath - moab , of the children of jeshua and joab , two thousand eight hundred and twelve .
the children of elam , a thousand two hundred fifty and four .
the children of zattu , nine hundred forty and five .
the children of zaccai , seven hundred and threescore .
blessed be the lord thy god , which delighted in thee , to set thee on the throne of israel : because the lord loved israel for ever , therefore made he thee king , to do judgment and justice .
happy are thy men , happy are these thy servants , which stand continually before thee , and that hear thy wisdom .
howbeit i believed not the words , until i came , and mine eyes had seen it : and , behold , the half was not told me : thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which i heard .
and she said to the king , it was a true report that i heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom .
and the meat of his table , and the sitting of his servants , and the attendance of his ministers , and their apparel , and his cupbearers , and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the lord ; there was no more spirit in her .
and she came to jerusalem with a very great train , with camels that bare spices , and very much gold , and precious stones : and when she was come to solomon , she communed with him of all that was in her heart .
and solomon told her all her questions : there was not any thing hid from the king , which he told her not .
and when the queen of sheba heard of the fame of solomon concerning the name of the lord , she came to prove him with hard questions .
in the three and twentieth year of joash the son of ahaziah king of judah jehoahaz the son of jehu began to reign over israel in samaria , and reigned seventeen years .
i am the lord thy god , which brought thee out of the land of egypt : open thy mouth wide , and i will fill it .
and needed not that any should testify of man : for he knew what was in man .
but my people would not hearken to my voice ; and israel would none of me .
but jesus did not commit himself unto them , because he knew all men ,
so i gave them up unto their own hearts ' lust : and they walked in their own counsels .
now when he was in jerusalem at the passover , in the feast day , many believed in his name , when they saw the miracles which he did .
oh that my people had hearkened unto me , and israel had walked in my ways !
when therefore he was risen from the dead , his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them ; and they believed the scripture , and the word which jesus had said .
i should soon have subdued their enemies , and turned my hand against their adversaries .
but he spake of the temple of his body .
whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment , and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him , he shall be put to death : only be strong and of a good courage .
the haters of the lord should have submitted themselves unto him : but their time should have endured for ever .
then said the jews , forty and six years was this temple in building , and wilt thou rear it up in three days ?
he should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat : and with honey out of the rock should i have satisfied thee .
your wives , your little ones , and your cattle , shall remain in the land which moses gave you on this side jordan ; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed , all the mighty men of valour , and help them ;
and they answered joshua , saying , all that thou commandest us we will do , and whithersoever thou sendest us , we will go .
according as we hearkened unto moses in all things , so will we hearken unto thee : only the lord thy god be with thee , as he was with moses .
then joshua commanded the officers of the people , saying ,
pass through the host , and command the people , saying , prepare you victuals ; for within three days ye shall pass over this jordan , to go in to possess the land , which the lord your god giveth you to possess it .
and to the reubenites , and to the gadites , and to half the tribe of manasseh , spake joshua , saying ,
remember the word which moses the servant of the lord commanded you , saying , the lord your god hath given you rest , and hath given you this land .
and jehoahaz besought the lord , and the lord hearkened unto him : for he saw the oppression of israel , because the king of syria oppressed them .
( and the lord gave israel a saviour , so that they went out from under the hand of the syrians : and the children of israel dwelt in their tents , as beforetime .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord , and followed the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat , which made israel to sin ; he departed not therefrom .
and the anger of the lord was kindled against israel , and he delivered them into the hand of hazael king of syria , and into the hand of ben - hadad the son of hazael , all their days .
now the rest of the acts of jehoahaz , and all that he did , and his might , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel ?
neither did he leave of the people to jehoahaz but fifty horsemen , and ten chariots , and ten thousand footmen ; for the king of syria had destroyed them , and had made them like the dust by threshing .
though he were a son , yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered ;
and being made perfect , he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him ;
as he saith also in another place , thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec .
who in the days of his flesh , when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death , and was heard in that he feared ;
and his disciples remembered that it was written , the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up .
jesus answered and said unto them , destroy this temple , and in three days i will raise it up .
then answered the jews and said unto him , what sign shewest thou unto us , seeing that thou doest these things ?
for every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to god , that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins :
after this he went down to capernaum , he , and his mother , and his brethren , and his disciples : and they continued there not many days .
and when he had made a scourge of small cords , he drove them all out of the temple , and the sheep , and the oxen ; and poured out the changers ' money , and overthrew the tables ;
and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves , and the changers of money sitting :
and no man taketh this honour unto himself , but he that is called of god , as was aaron .
so also christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest ; but he that said unto him , thou art my son , to day have i begotten thee .
who can have compassion on the ignorant , and on them that are out of the way ; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity .
this beginning of miracles did jesus in cana of galilee , and manifested forth his glory ; and his disciples believed on him .
and by reason hereof he ought , as for the people , so also for himself , to offer for sins .
and saith unto him , every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine ; and when men have well drunk , then that which is worse : but thou hast kept the good wine until now .
and god said to jonah , doest thou well to be angry for the gourd ? and he said , i do well to be angry , even unto death .
but god prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day , and it smote the gourd that it withered .
and it came to pass , when the sun did arise , that god prepared a vehement east wind ; and the sun beat upon the head of jonah , that he fainted , and wished in himself to die , and said , it is better for me to die than to live .
so jonah went out of the city , and sat on the east side of the city , and there made him a booth , and sat under it in the shadow , till he might see what would become of the city .
and the lord god prepared a gourd , and made it to come up over jonah , that it might be a shadow over his head , to deliver him from his grief . so jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd .
therefore now , o lord , take , i beseech thee , my life from me ; for it is better for me to die than to live .
then said the lord , doest thou well to be angry ?
and prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers , after your courses , according to the writing of david king of israel , and according to the writing of solomon his son .
but it displeased jonah exceedingly , and he was very angry .
and said unto the levites that taught all israel , which were holy unto the lord , put the holy ark in the house which solomon the son of david king of israel did build ; it shall not be a burden upon your shoulders : serve now the lord your god , and his people israel ,
and he set the priests in their charges , and encouraged them to the service of the house of the lord ,
moreover josiah kept a passover unto the lord in jerusalem : and they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month .
and his princes gave willingly unto the people , to the priests , and to the levites : hilkiah and zechariah and jehiel , rulers of the house of god , gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle , and three hundred oxen .
and josiah gave to the people , of the flock , lambs and kids , all for the passover offerings , for all that were present , to the number of thirty thousand , and three thousand bullocks : these were of the king ' s substance .
so kill the passover , and sanctify yourselves , and prepare your brethren , that they may do according to the word of the lord by the hand of moses .
and stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people , and after the division of the families of the levites .
conaniah also , and shemaiah and nethaneel , his brethren , and hashabiah and jeiel and jozabad , chief of the levites , gave unto the levites for passover offerings five thousand small cattle , and five hundred oxen .
which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession , unto the praise of his glory .
in whom ye also trusted , after that ye heard the word of truth , the gospel of your salvation : in whom also after that ye believed , ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise ,
cease not to give thanks for you , making mention of you in my prayers ;
wherefore i also , after i heard of your faith in the lord jesus , and love unto all the saints ,
that in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ , both which are in heaven , and which are on earth ; even in him :
in whom also we have obtained an inheritance , being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will :
and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to usward who believe , according to the working of his mighty power ,
that the god of our lord jesus christ , the father of glory , may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him :
which is his body , the fulness of him that filleth all in all .
and hath put all things under his feet , and gave him to be the head over all things to the church ,
far above all principality , and power , and might , and dominion , and every name that is named , not only in this world , but also in that which is to come :
which he wrought in christ , when he raised him from the dead , and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places ,
now the philistines fought against israel ; and the men of israel fled from before the philistines , and fell down slain in mount gilboa .
and the philistines followed hard after saul , and after his sons ; and the philistines slew jonathan , and abinadab , and malchi - shua , the sons of saul .
and when they had stripped him , they took his head , and his armour , and sent into the land of the philistines round about , to carry tidings unto their idols , and to the people .
and when all the men of israel that were in the valley saw that they fled , and that saul and his sons were dead , then they forsook their cities , and fled : and the philistines came and dwelt in them .
and it came to pass on the morrow , when the philistines came to strip the slain , that they found saul and his sons fallen in mount gilboa .
so saul died , and his three sons , and all his house died together .
and the battle went sore against saul , and the archers hit him , and he was wounded of the archers .
then said saul to his armourbearer , draw thy sword , and thrust me through therewith ; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me . but his armourbearer would not ; for he was sore afraid . so saul took a sword , and fell upon it .
i beheld , and the same horn made war with the saints , and prevailed against them ;
the lord is well pleased for his righteousness ' sake ; he will magnify the law , and make it honourable .
and of the ten horns that were in his head , and of the other which came up , and before whom three fell ; even of that horn that had eyes , and a mouth that spake very great things , whose look was more stout than his fellows .
who gave jacob for a spoil , and israel to the robbers ? did not the lord , he against whom we have sinned ? for they would not walk in his ways , neither were they obedient unto his law .
who among you will give ear to this ? who will hearken and hear for the time to come ?
if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things , thou shalt be a good minister of jesus christ , nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine , whereunto thou hast attained .
but refuse profane and old wives ' fables , and exercise thyself rather unto godliness .
for bodily exercise profiteth little : but godliness is profitable unto all things , having promise of the life that now is , and of that which is to come .
then i would know the truth of the fourth beast , which was diverse from all the others , exceeding dreadful , whose teeth were of iron , and his nails of brass ; which devoured , brake in pieces , and stamped the residue with his feet ;
this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation .
speaking lies in hypocrisy ; having their conscience seared with a hot iron ;
these great beasts , which are four , are four kings , which shall arise out of the earth .
forbidding to marry , and commanding to abstain from meats , which god hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth .
but the saints of the most high shall take the kingdom , and possess the kingdom for ever , even for ever and ever .
for every creature of god is good , and nothing to be refused , if it be received with thanksgiving :
i daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body , and the visions of my head troubled me .
for it is sanctified by the word of god and prayer .
i came near unto one of them that stood by , and asked him the truth of all this . so he told me , and made me know the interpretation of the things .
therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger , and the strength of battle : and it hath set him on fire round about , yet he knew not ; and it burned him , yet he laid it not to heart .
i saw in the night visions , and , behold , one like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven , and came to the ancient of days , and they brought him near before him .
and there was given him dominion , and glory , and a kingdom , that all people , nations , and languages , should serve him : his dominion is an everlasting dominion , which shall not pass away , and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed .
i beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake : i beheld even till the beast was slain , and his body destroyed , and given to the burning flame .
now the spirit speaketh expressly , that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith , giving heed to seducing spirits , and doctrines of devils ;
as concerning the rest of the beasts , they had their dominion taken away : yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time .
a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him : thousand thousands ministered unto him , and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him : the judgment was set , and the books were opened .
wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way ? by taking heed thereto according to thy word .
thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently .
they also do no iniquity : they walk in his ways .
blessed are they that keep his testimonies , and that seek him with the whole heart .
blessed are the undefiled in the way , who walk in the law of the lord .
i will keep thy statutes : o forsake me not utterly .
i will praise thee with uprightness of heart , when i shall have learned thy righteous judgments .
then shall i not be ashamed , when i have respect unto all thy commandments .
o that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes !
the lord shall go forth as a mighty man , he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war : he shall cry , yea , roar ; he shall prevail against his enemies .
let them give glory unto the lord , and declare his praise in the islands .
let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice , the villages that kedar doth inhabit : let the inhabitants of the rock sing , let them shout from the top of the mountains .
sing unto the lord a new song , and his praise from the end of the earth , ye that go down to the sea , and all that is therein ; the isles , and the inhabitants thereof .
and i will bring the blind by a way that they knew not ; i will lead them in paths that they have not known : i will make darkness light before them , and crooked things straight . these things will i do unto them , and not forsake them .
until the ancient of days came , and judgment was given to the saints of the most high ; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom .
they shall be turned back , they shall be greatly ashamed , that trust in graven images , that say to the molten images , ye are our gods .
thus he said , the fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth , which shall be diverse from all kingdoms , and shall devour the whole earth , and shall tread it down , and break it in pieces .
i have long time holden my peace ; i have been still , and refrained myself : now will i cry like a travailing woman ; i will destroy and devour at once .
and the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise : and another shall rise after them ; and he shall be diverse from the first , and he shall subdue three kings .
i will make waste mountains and hills , and dry up all their herbs ; and i will make the rivers islands , and i will dry up the pools .
and he shall speak great words against the most high , and shall wear out the saints of the most high , and think to change times and laws : and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time .
but the judgment shall sit , and they shall take away his dominion , to consume and to destroy it unto the end .
and the kingdom and dominion , and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven , shall be given to the people of the saints of the most high , whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom , and all dominions shall serve and obey him .
hear , ye deaf ; and look , ye blind , that ye may see .
hitherto is the end of the matter . as for me daniel , my cogitations much troubled me , and my countenance changed in me : but i kept the matter in my heart .
who is blind , but my servant ? or deaf , as my messenger that i sent ? who is blind as he that is perfect , and blind as the lord ' s servant ?
that thou hast also built unto thee an eminent place , and hast made thee an high place in every street .
and it came to pass after all thy wickedness , ( woe , woe unto thee ! saith the lord god ; )
thou hast also committed fornication with the egyptians thy neighbours , great of flesh ; and hast increased thy whoredoms , to provoke me to anger .
thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way , and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred , and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by , and multiplied thy whoredoms .
thou hast played the whore also with the assyrians , because thou wast unsatiable ; yea , thou hast played the harlot with them , and yet couldest not be satisfied .
behold , therefore i have stretched out my hand over thee , and have diminished thine ordinary food , and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee , the daughters of the philistines , which are ashamed of thy lewd way .
thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of canaan unto chaldea ; and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith .
solomon had a vineyard at baal - hamon ; he let out the vineyard unto keepers ; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver .
my vineyard , which is mine , is before me : thou , o solomon , must have a thousand , and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred .
i am a wall , and my breasts like towers : then was i in his eyes as one that found favour .
how weak is thine heart , saith the lord god , seeing thou doest all these things , the work of an imperious whorish woman ;
in that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way , and makest thine high place in every street ; and hast not been as an harlot , in that thou scornest hire ;
but as a wife that committeth adultery , which taketh strangers instead of her husband !
but thou didst trust in thine own beauty , and playedst the harlot because of thy renown , and pouredst out thy fornications on every one that passed by ; his it was .
and thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty : for it was perfect through my comeliness , which i had put upon thee , saith the lord god .
thus wast thou decked with gold and silver ; and thy raiment was of fine linen , and silk , and broidered work ; thou didst eat fine flour , and honey , and oil : and thou wast exceeding beautiful , and thou didst prosper into a kingdom .
and i put a jewel on thy forehead , and earrings in thine ears , and a beautiful crown upon thine head .
my meat also which i gave thee , fine flour , and oil , and honey , wherewith i fed thee , thou hast even set it before them for a sweet savour : and thus it was , saith the lord god .
and tookest thy broidered garments , and coveredst them : and thou hast set mine oil and mine incense before them .
thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver , which i had given thee , and madest to thyself images of men , and didst commit whoredom with them ,
and of thy garments thou didst take , and deckedst thy high places with divers colours , and playedst the harlot thereupon : the like things shall not come , neither shall it be so .
make haste , my beloved , and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices .
thou that dwellest in the gardens , the companions hearken to thy voice : cause me to hear it .
( as it is written , he hath dispersed abroad ; he hath given to the poor : his righteousness remaineth for ever .
but this i say , he which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly ; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully .
therefore i thought it necessary to exhort the brethren , that they would go before unto you , and make up beforehand your bounty , whereof ye had notice before , that the same might be ready , as a matter of bounty , and not as of covetousness .
and god is able to make all grace abound toward you ; that ye , always having all sufficiency in all things , may abound to every good work :
every man according as he purposeth in his heart , so let him give ; not grudgingly , or of necessity : for god loveth a cheerful giver .
for i know the forwardness of your mind , for which i boast of you to them of macedonia , that achaia was ready a year ago ; and your zeal hath provoked very many .
that thou hast slain my children , and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them ?
for as touching the ministering to the saints , it is superfluous for me to write to you :
and in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth , when thou wast naked and bare , and wast polluted in thy blood .
lest haply if they of macedonia come with me , and find you unprepared , we ( that we say not , ye ) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting .
yet have i sent the brethren , lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf ; that , as i said , ye may be ready :
moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters , whom thou hast borne unto me , and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured . is this of thy whoredoms a small matter ,
then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service , and a worldly sanctuary .
now when these things were thus ordained , the priests went always into the first tabernacle , accomplishing the service of god .
but into the second went the high priest alone once every year , not without blood , which he offered for himself , and for the errors of the people :
for from the top of the rocks i see him , and from the hills i behold him : lo , the people shall dwell alone , and shall not be reckoned among the nations .
the holy ghost this signifying , that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest , while as the first tabernacle was yet standing :
which was a figure for the time then present , in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices , that could not make him that did the service perfect , as pertaining to the conscience ;
for there was a tabernacle made ; the first , wherein was the candlestick , and the table , and the shewbread ; which is called the sanctuary .
and after the second veil , the tabernacle which is called the holiest of all ;
which had the golden censer , and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold , wherein was the golden pot that had manna , and aaron ' s rod that budded , and the tables of the covenant ;
and over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat ; of which we cannot now speak particularly .
and all the cities of those kings , and all the kings of them , did joshua take , and smote them with the edge of the sword , and he utterly destroyed them , as moses the servant of the lord commanded .
and they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword , utterly destroying them : there was not any left to breathe : and he burnt hazor with fire .
and joshua at that time turned back , and took hazor , and smote the king thereof with the sword : for hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms .
so joshua took all that land , the hills , and all the south country , and all the land of goshen , and the valley , and the plain , and the mountain of israel , and the valley of the same ;
as the lord commanded moses his servant , so did moses command joshua , and so did joshua ; he left nothing undone of all that the lord commanded moses .
and all the spoil of these cities , and the cattle , the children of israel took for a prey unto themselves ; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword , until they had destroyed them , neither left they any to breathe .
but as for the cities that stood still in their strength , israel burned none of them , save hazor only ; that did joshua burn .
there was not a city that made peace with the children of israel , save the hivites the inhabitants of gibeon : all other they took in battle .
joshua made war a long time with all those kings .
i clothed thee also with broidered work , and shod thee with badgers ' skin , and i girded thee about with fine linen , and i covered thee with silk .
even from the mount halak , that goeth up to seir , even unto baal - gad in the valley of lebanon under mount hermon : and all their kings he took , and smote them , and slew them .
i decked thee also with ornaments , and i put bracelets upon thy hands , and a chain on thy neck .
then she runneth , and cometh to simon peter , and to the other disciple , whom jesus loved , and saith unto them , they have taken away the lord out of the sepulchre , and we know not where they have laid him .
the first day of the week cometh mary magdalene early , when it was yet dark , unto the sepulchre , and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre .
so they ran both together : and the other disciple did outrun peter , and came first to the sepulchre .
peter therefore went forth , and that other disciple , and came to the sepulchre .
then cometh simon peter following him , and went into the sepulchre , and seeth the linen clothes lie ,
and he stooping down , and looking in , saw the linen clothes lying ; yet went he not in .
then went in also that other disciple , which came first to the sepulchre , and he saw , and believed .
and the napkin , that was about his head , not lying with the linen clothes , but wrapped together in a place by itself .
and balaam said unto balak , stand by thy burnt offering , and i will go : peradventure the lord will come to meet me : and whatsoever he sheweth me i will tell thee . and he went to an high place .
and god met balaam : and he said unto him , i have prepared seven altars , and i have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram .
and balaam said unto balak , build me here seven altars , and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams .
and he took up his parable , and said , balak the king of moab hath brought me from aram , out of the mountains of the east , saying , come , curse me jacob , and come , defy israel .
how shall i curse , whom god hath not cursed ? or how shall i defy , whom the lord hath not defied ?
and the lord put a word in balaam ' s mouth , and said , return unto balak , and thus thou shalt speak .
and he returned unto him , and , lo , he stood by his burnt sacrifice , he , and all the princes of moab .
to overthrow their seed also among the nations , and to scatter them in the lands .
they joined themselves also unto baal - peor , and ate the sacrifices of the dead .
thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions : and the plague brake in upon them .
therefore he said that he would destroy them , had not moses his chosen stood before him in the breach , to turn away his wrath , lest he should destroy them .
yea , they despised the pleasant land , they believed not his word :
but murmured in their tents , and hearkened not unto the voice of the lord .
therefore he lifted up his hand against them , to overthrow them in the wilderness :
of how much sorer punishment , suppose ye , shall he be thought worthy , who hath trodden under foot the son of god , and hath counted the blood of the covenant , wherewith he was sanctified , an unholy thing , and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace ?
he that despised moses ' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses :
thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass .
they forgat god their saviour , which had done great things in egypt ;
wondrous works in the land of ham , and terrible things by the red sea .
cast not away therefore your confidence , which hath great recompence of reward .
for ye have need of patience , that , after ye have done the will of god , ye might receive the promise .
for yet a little while , and he that shall come will come , and will not tarry .
now the just shall live by faith : but if any man draw back , my soul shall have no pleasure in him .
it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god .
but call to remembrance the former days , in which , after ye were illuminated , ye endured a great fight of afflictions ;
partly , whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions ; and partly , whilst ye became companions of them that were so used .
for ye had compassion of me in my bonds , and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods , knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance .
it is reported commonly that there is fornication among you , and such fornication as is not so much as named among the gentiles , that one should have his father ' s wife .
for we know him that hath said , vengeance belongeth unto me , i will recompense , saith the lord . and again , the lord shall judge his people .
to deliver such an one unto satan for the destruction of the flesh , that the spirit may be saved in the day of the lord jesus .
in the name of our lord jesus christ , when ye are gathered together , and my spirit , with the power of our lord jesus christ ,
for i verily , as absent in body , but present in spirit , have judged already , as though i were present , concerning him that hath so done this deed ,
and ye are puffed up , and have not rather mourned , that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you .
your glorying is not good . know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump ?
nevertheless i will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth , and i will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant .
purge out therefore the old leaven , that ye may be a new lump , as ye are unleavened . for even christ our passover is sacrificed for us :
and now , behold , the king walketh before you : and i am old and grayheaded ; and , behold , my sons are with you : and i have walked before you from my childhood unto this day .
therefore let us keep the feast , not with old leaven , neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness ; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth .
and he said unto them , the lord is witness against you , and his anointed is witness this day , that ye have not found ought in my hand . and they answered , he is witness .
and i will establish my covenant with thee ; and thou shalt know that i am the lord :
then thou shalt remember thy ways , and be ashamed , when thou shalt receive thy sisters , thine elder and thy younger : and i will give them unto thee for daughters , but not by thy covenant .
now therefore stand still , that i may reason with you before the lord of all the righteous acts of the lord , which he did to you and to your fathers .
and a fire was kindled in their company ; the flame burned up the wicked .
and samuel said unto the people , it is the lord that advanced moses and aaron , and that brought your fathers up out of the land of egypt .
they made a calf in horeb , and worshipped the molten image .
that thou mayest remember , and be confounded , and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame , when i am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done , saith the lord god .
and when they forgat the lord their god , he sold them into the hand of sisera , captain of the host of hazor , and into the hand of the philistines , and into the hand of the king of moab , and they fought against them .
they envied moses also in the camp , and aaron the saint of the lord .
now therefore , tatnai , governor beyond the river , shethar - boznai , and your companions the apharsachites , which are beyond the river , be ye far from thence :
but lusted exceedingly in the wilderness , and tempted god in the desert .
and he gave them their request ; but sent leanness into their soul .
moreover i made a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these jews for the building of this house of god : that of the king ' s goods , even of the tribute beyond the river , forthwith expences be given unto these men , that they be not hindered .
then believed they his words ; they sang his praise .
let the work of this house of god alone ; let the governor of the jews and the elders of the jews build this house of god in his place .
they soon forgat his works ; they waited not for his counsel :
and he saved them from the hand of him that hated them , and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy .
having therefore , brethren , boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus ,
and that which they have need of , both young bullocks , and rams , and lambs , for the burnt offerings of the god of heaven , wheat , salt , wine , and oil , according to the appointment of the priests which are at jerusalem , let it be given them day by day without fail :
and the waters covered their enemies : there was not one of them left .
now where remission of these is , there is no more offering for sin .
and their sins and iniquities will i remember no more .
for if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth , there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins ,
but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation , which shall devour the adversaries .
not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together , as the manner of some is ; but exhorting one another : and so much the more , as ye see the day approaching .
let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith , having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience , and our bodies washed with pure water .
let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering ; ( for he is faithful that promised ; )
by a new and living way , which he hath consecrated for us , through the veil , that is to say , his flesh ;
and having an high priest over the house of god ;
for thy sister sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride ,
before thy wickedness was discovered , as at the time of thy reproach of the daughters of syria , and all that are round about her , the daughters of the philistines , which despise thee round about .
thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations , saith the lord .
for thus saith the lord god ; i will even deal with thee as thou hast done , which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant .
when jesus saw him lie , and knew that he had been now a long time in that case , he saith unto him , wilt thou be made whole ?
when thy sisters , sodom and her daughters , shall return to their former estate , and samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate , then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate .
the impotent man answered him , sir , i have no man , when the water is troubled , to put me into the pool : but while i am coming , another steppeth down before me .
that thou mayest bear thine own shame , and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done , in that thou art a comfort unto them .
for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool , and troubled the water : whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had .
when i shall bring again their captivity , the captivity of sodom and her daughters , and the captivity of samaria and her daughters , then will i bring again the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them :
and a certain man was there , which had an infirmity thirty and eight years .
thou also , which hast judged thy sisters , bear thine own shame for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they : they are more righteous than thou : yea , be thou confounded also , and bear thy shame , in that thou hast justified thy sisters .
now there is at jerusalem by the sheep market a pool , which is called in the hebrew tongue bethesda , having five porches .
neither hath samaria committed half of thy sins ; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they , and hast justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done .
in these lay a great multitude of impotent folk , of blind , halt , withered , waiting for the moving of the water .
and they were haughty , and committed abomination before me : therefore i took them away as i saw good .
after this there was a feast of the jews ; and jesus went up to jerusalem .
jesus saith unto him , rise , take up thy bed , and walk .
and immediately the man was made whole , and took up his bed , and walked : and on the same day was the sabbath .
in the first year of cyrus the king the same cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of god at jerusalem , let the house be builded , the place where they offered sacrifices , and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid ; the height thereof threescore cubits , and the breadth thereof threescore cubits ;
with three rows of great stones , and a row of new timber : and let the expences be given out of the king ' s house :
then darius the king made a decree , and search was made in the house of the rolls , where the treasures were laid up in babylon .
and there was found at achmetha , in the palace that is in the province of the medes , a roll , and therein was a record thus written :
behold , this was the iniquity of thy sister sodom , pride , fulness of bread , and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters , neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy .
yet hast thou not walked after their ways , nor done after their abominations : but , as if that were a very little thing , thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways .
as i live , saith the lord god , sodom thy sister hath not done , she nor her daughters , as thou hast done , thou and thy daughters .
thou art thy mother ' s daughter , that lotheth her husband and her children ; and thou art the sister of thy sisters , which lothed their husbands and their children : your mother was an hittite , and your father an amorite .
and thine elder sister is samaria , she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand : and thy younger sister , that dwelleth at thy right hand , is sodom and her daughters .
so will i make my fury toward thee to rest , and my jealousy shall depart from thee , and i will be quiet , and will be no more angry .
and they shall burn thine houses with fire , and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women : and i will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot , and thou also shalt give no hire any more .
because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth , but hast fretted me in all these things ; behold , therefore i also will recompense thy way upon thine head , saith the lord god : and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations .
they shall also bring up a company against thee , and they shall stone thee with stones , and thrust thee through with their swords .
but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition ; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul .
and i will judge thee , as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged ; and i will give thee blood in fury and jealousy .
and i will also give thee into their hand , and they shall throw down thine eminent place , and shall break down thy high places : they shall strip thee also of thy clothes , and shall take thy fair jewels , and leave thee naked and bare .
and the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms , whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms : and in that thou givest a reward , and no reward is given unto thee , therefore thou art contrary .
wherefore , o harlot , hear the word of the lord :
thus saith the lord god ; because thy filthiness was poured out , and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers , and with all the idols of thy abominations , and by the blood of thy children , which thou didst give unto them ;
behold , therefore i will gather all thy lovers , with whom thou hast taken pleasure , and all them that thou hast loved , with all them that thou hast hated ; i will even gather them round about against thee , and will discover thy nakedness unto them , that they may see all thy nakedness .
offer the sacrifices of righteousness , and put your trust in the lord .
but know that the lord hath set apart him that is godly for himself : the lord will hear when i call unto him .
o ye sons of men , how long will ye turn my glory into shame ? how long will ye love vanity , and seek after leasing ? selah .
hear me when i call , o god of my righteousness : thou hast enlarged me when i was in distress ; have mercy upon me , and hear my prayer .
but had certain questions against him of their own superstition , and of one jesus , which was dead , whom paul affirmed to be alive .
be not a terror unto me : thou art my hope in the day of evil .
as for me , i have not hastened from being a pastor to follow thee : neither have i desired the woeful day ; thou knowest : that which came out of my lips was right before thee .
therefore , when they were come hither , without any delay on the morrow i sat on the judgment seat , and commanded the man to be brought forth .
behold , they say unto me , where is the word of the lord ? let it come now .
to whom i answered , it is not the manner of the romans to deliver any man to die , before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face , and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him .
heal me , o lord , and i shall be healed ; save me , and i shall be saved : for thou art my praise .
thus said the lord unto me ; go and stand in the gate of the children of the people , whereby the kings of judah come in , and by the which they go out , and in all the gates of jerusalem ;
let them be confounded that persecute me , but let not me be confounded : let them be dismayed , but let not me be dismayed : bring upon them the day of evil , and destroy them with double destruction .
for if i be an offender , or have committed any thing worthy of death , i refuse not to die : but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me , no man may deliver me unto them . i appeal unto caesar .
then said paul , i stand at caesar ' s judgment seat , where i ought to be judged : to the jews have i done no wrong , as thou very well knowest .
about whom , when i was at jerusalem , the chief priests and the elders of the jews informed me , desiring to have judgment against him .
there be many that say , who will shew us any good ? lord , lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us .
o lord , the hope of israel , all that forsake thee shall be ashamed , and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth , because they have forsaken the lord , the fountain of living waters .
and when they had been there many days , festus declared paul ' s cause unto the king , saying , there is a certain man left in bonds by felix :
a glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary .
and after certain days king agrippa and bernice came unto caesarea to salute festus .
i will both lay me down in peace , and sleep : for thou , lord , only makest me dwell in safety .
as the partridge sitteth on eggs , and hatcheth them not ; so he that getteth riches , and not by right , shall leave them in the midst of his days , and at his end shall be a fool .
then festus , when he had conferred with the council , answered , hast thou appealed unto caesar ? unto caesar shalt thou go .
i the lord search the heart , i try the reins , even to give every man according to his ways , and according to the fruit of his doings .
for it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner , and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him .
then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of david , riding in chariots and on horses , they , and their princes , the men of judah , and the inhabitants of jerusalem : and this city shall remain for ever .
and festus said , king agrippa , and all men which are here present with us , ye see this man , about whom all the multitude of the jews have dealt with me , both at jerusalem , and also here , crying that he ought not to live any longer .
and joseph knew his brethren , but they knew not him .
neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day , neither do ye any work , but hallow ye the sabbath day , as i commanded your fathers .
and on the morrow , when agrippa was come , and bernice , with great pomp , and was entered into the place of hearing , with the chief captains , and principal men of the city , at festus ' commandment paul was brought forth .
and joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them , and said unto them , ye are spies ; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come .
thus saith the lord ; take heed to yourselves , and bear no burden on the sabbath day , nor bring it in by the gates of jerusalem ;
and joseph was the governor over the land , and he it was that sold to all the people of the land : and joseph ' s brethren came , and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth .
and it shall come to pass , if ye diligently hearken unto me , saith the lord , to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day , but hallow the sabbath day , to do no work therein ;
but when i found that he had committed nothing worthy of death , and that he himself hath appealed to augustus , i have determined to send him .
and joseph saw his brethren , and he knew them , but made himself strange unto them , and spake roughly unto them ; and he said unto them , whence come ye ? and they said , from the land of canaan to buy food .
but they obeyed not , neither inclined their ear , but made their neck stiff , that they might not hear , nor receive instruction .
and because i doubted of such manner of questions , i asked him whether he would go to jerusalem , and there be judged of these matters .
then agrippa said unto festus , i would also hear the man myself . to morrow , said he , thou shalt hear him .
and say unto them , hear ye the word of the lord , ye kings of judah , and all judah , and all the inhabitants of jerusalem , that enter in by these gates :
but when paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of augustus , i commanded him to be kept till i might send him to caesar .
now when jacob saw that there was corn in egypt , jacob said unto his sons , why do ye look one upon another ?
and the sons of israel came to buy corn among those that came : for the famine was in the land of canaan .
and joseph ' s ten brethren went down to buy corn in egypt .
and he said , behold , i have heard that there is corn in egypt : get you down thither , and buy for us from thence ; that we may live , and not die .
by the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus christ once for all .
but this man , after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever , sat down on the right hand of god ;
and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices , which can never take away sins :
for by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified .
from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool .
this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days , saith the lord , i will put my laws into their hearts , and in their minds will i write them ;
whereof the holy ghost also is a witness to us : for after that he had said before ,
and delilah said unto samson , behold , thou hast mocked me , and told me lies : now tell me , i pray thee , wherewith thou mightest be bound .
and delilah said unto samson , hitherto thou hast mocked me , and told me lies : tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound . and he said unto her , if thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web .
and she fastened it with the pin , and said unto him , the philistines be upon thee , samson . and he awaked out of his sleep , and went away with the pin of the beam , and with the web .
and he said unto her , if they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied , then shall i be weak , and be as another man .
delilah therefore took new ropes , and bound him therewith , and said unto him , the philistines be upon thee , samson . and there were liers in wait abiding in the chamber . and he brake them from off his arms like a thread .
and it came to pass , when she pressed him daily with her words , and urged him , so that his soul was vexed unto death ;
and she said unto him , how canst thou say , i love thee , when thine heart is not with me ? thou hast mocked me these three times , and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth .
and when delilah saw that he had told her all his heart , she sent and called for the lords of the philistines , saying , come up this once , for he hath shewed me all his heart . then the lords of the philistines came up unto her , and brought money in their hand .
and she made him sleep upon her knees ; and she called for a man , and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head ; and she began to afflict him , and his strength went from him .
and she said , the philistines be upon thee , samson . and he awoke out of his sleep , and said , i will go out as at other times before , and shake myself . and he wist not that the lord was departed from him .
but the philistines took him , and put out his eyes , and brought him down to gaza , and bound him with fetters of brass ; and he did grind in the prison house .
howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven .
then the lords of the philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto dagon their god , and to rejoice : for they said , our god hath delivered samson our enemy into our hand .
and when the people saw him , they praised their god : for they said , our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy , and the destroyer of our country , which slew many of us .
and it came to pass , when their hearts were merry , that they said , call for samson , that he may make us sport . and they called for samson out of the prison house ; and he made them sport : and they set him between the pillars .
and the king of egypt made eliakim his brother king over judah and jerusalem , and turned his name to jehoiakim . and necho took jehoahaz his brother , and carried him to egypt .
jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem : and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord his god .
against him came up nebuchadnezzar king of babylon , and bound him in fetters , to carry him to babylon .
nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the lord to babylon , and put them in his temple at babylon .
and samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood , and on which it was borne up , of the one with his right hand , and of the other with his left .
then the people of the land took jehoahaz the son of josiah , and made him king in his father ' s stead in jerusalem .
and samson called unto the lord , and said , o lord god , remember me , i pray thee , and strengthen me , i pray thee , only this once , o god , that i may be at once avenged of the philistines for my two eyes .
jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign , and he reigned three months in jerusalem .
now the house was full of men and women ; and all the lords of the philistines were there ; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women , that beheld while samson made sport .
and the king of egypt put him down at jerusalem , and condemned the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold .
and samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand , suffer me that i may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth , that i may lean upon them .
and he changed his behaviour before them , and feigned himself mad in their hands , and scrabbled on the doors of the gate , and let his spittle fall down upon his beard .
then said achish unto his servants , lo , ye see the man is mad : wherefore then have ye brought him to me ?
and the servants of achish said unto him , is not this david the king of the land ? did they not sing one to another of him in dances , saying , saul hath slain his thousands , and david his ten thousands ?
and david laid up these words in his heart , and was sore afraid of achish the king of gath .
for there is no faithfulness in their mouth ; their inward part is very wickedness ; their throat is an open sepulchre ; they flatter with their tongue .
jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign , and he reigned three months and ten days in jerusalem : and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord .
then his brethren and all the house of his father came down , and took him , and brought him up , and buried him between zorah and eshtaol in the burying place of manoah his father . and he judged israel twenty years .
lead me , o lord , in thy righteousness because of mine enemies ; make thy way straight before my face .
now the rest of the acts of jehoiakim , and his abominations which he did , and that which was found in him , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of israel and judah : and jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead .
and david arose , and fled that day for fear of saul , and went to achish the king of gath .
but as for me , i will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy : and in thy fear will i worship toward thy holy temple .
thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing : the lord will abhor the bloody and deceitful man .
and samson said , let me die with the philistines . and he bowed himself with all his might ; and the house fell upon the lords , and upon all the people that were therein . so the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life .
the foolish shall not stand in thy sight : thou hatest all workers of iniquity .
have i need of mad men , that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence ? shall this fellow come into my house ?
give ear to my words , o lord , consider my meditation .
hearken unto the voice of my cry , my king , and my god : for unto thee will i pray .
my voice shalt thou hear in the morning , o lord ; in the morning will i direct my prayer unto thee , and will look up .
for thou art not a god that hath pleasure in wickedness : neither shall evil dwell with thee .
lover and friend hast thou put far from me , and mine acquaintance into darkness .
they came round about me daily like water ; they compassed me about together .
thy fierce wrath goeth over me ; thy terrors have cut me off .
i am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up : while i suffer thy terrors i am distracted .
lord , why castest thou off my soul ? why hidest thou thy face from me ?
but unto thee have i cried , o lord ; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee .
shall thy wonders be known in the dark ? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness ?
shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave ? or thy faithfulness in destruction ?
and the sons of neariah ; elioenai , and hezekiah , and azrikam , three .
wilt thou shew wonders to the dead ? shall the dead arise and praise thee ? selah .
and the sons of elioenai were , hodaiah , and eliashib , and pelaiah , and akkub , and johanan , and dalaiah , and anani , seven .
and hashubah , and ohel , and berechiah , and hasadiah , jushab - hesed , five .
and the sons of hananiah ; pelatiah , and jesaiah : the sons of rephaiah , the sons of arnan , the sons of obadiah , the sons of shechaniah .
and the sons of shechaniah ; shemaiah ; and the sons of shemaiah ; hattush , and igeal , and bariah , and neariah , and shaphat , six .
ahaz his son , hezekiah his son , manasseh his son ,
amaziah his son , azariah his son , jotham his son ,
and the sons of josiah were , the firstborn johanan , the second jehoiakim , the third zedekiah , the fourth shallum .
amon his son , josiah his son .
but as for you , ye thought evil against me ; but god meant it unto good , to bring to pass , as it is this day , to save much people alive .
and the sons of jeconiah ; assir , salathiel his son ,
and the sons of jehoiakim : jeconiah his son , zedekiah his son .
and the sons of pedaiah were , zerubbabel , and shimei : and the sons of zerubbabel ; meshullam , and hananiah , and shelomith their sister :
malchiram also , and pedaiah , and shenazar , jecamiah , hoshama , and nedabiah .
ye shall offer at your own will a male without blemish , of the beeves , of the sheep , or of the goats .
and joseph took an oath of the children of israel , saying , god will surely visit you , and ye shall carry up my bones from hence .
so joseph died , being an hundred and ten years old : and they embalmed him , and he was put in a coffin in egypt .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
and if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly , then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it , and shall give it unto the priest with the holy thing .
and they shall not profane the holy things of the children of israel , which they offer unto the lord ;
now therefore fear ye not : i will nourish you , and your little ones . and he comforted them , and spake kindly unto them .
if the priest ' s daughter also be married unto a stranger , she may not eat of an offering of the holy things .
and joseph dwelt in egypt , he , and his father ' s house : and joseph lived an hundred and ten years .
but if the priest ' s daughter be a widow , or divorced , and have no child , and is returned unto her father ' s house , as in her youth , she shall eat of her father ' s meat : but there shall no stranger eat thereof .
and joseph saw ephraim ' s children of the third generation : the children also of machir the son manasseh were brought up upon joseph ' s knees .
there shall no stranger eat of the holy thing : a sojourner of the priest , or an hired servant , shall not eat of the holy thing .
and joseph said unto his brethren , i die : and god will surely visit you , and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to abraham , to isaac , and to jacob .
said he not unto me , she is my sister ? and she , even she herself said , he is my brother : in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have i done this .
but abimelech had not come near her : and he said , lord , wilt thou slay also a righteous nation ?
but whatsoever hath a blemish , that shall ye not offer : for it shall not be acceptable for you .
and abraham said of sarah his wife , she is my sister : and abimelech king of gerar sent , and took sarah .
and abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country , and dwelled between kadesh and shur , and sojourned in gerar .
and joseph said unto them , fear not : for am i in the place of god ?
and his brethren also went and fell down before his face ; and they said , behold , we be thy servants .
and solomon ' s son was rehoboam , abia his son , asa his son , jehoshaphat his son ,
joram his son , ahaziah his son , joash his son ,
and when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the lord , offer it at your own will .
and they sent a messenger unto joseph , saying , thy father did command before he died , saying ,
neither from a stranger ' s hand shall ye offer the bread of your god of any of these ; because their corruption is in them , and blemishes be in them : they shall not be accepted for you .
so shall ye say unto joseph , forgive , i pray thee now , the trespass of thy brethren , and their sin ; for they did unto thee evil : and now , we pray thee , forgive the trespass of the servants of the god of thy father . and joseph wept when they spake unto him .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
and joseph returned into egypt , he , and his brethren , and all that went up with him to bury his father , after he had buried his father .
when a bullock , or a sheep , or a goat , is brought forth , then it shall be seven days under the dam ; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the lord .
and when joseph ' s brethren saw that their father was dead , they said , joseph will peradventure hate us , and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him .
and whether it be cow or ewe , ye shall not kill it and her young both in one day .
therefore abimelech rose early in the morning , and called all his servants , and told all these things in their ears : and the men were sore afraid .
and his sons did unto him according as he commanded them :
and whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the lord to accomplish his vow , or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep , it shall be perfect to be accepted ; there shall be no blemish therein .
then abimelech called abraham , and said unto him , what hast thou done unto us ? and what have i offended thee , that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin ? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done .
for his sons carried him into the land of canaan , and buried him in the cave of the field of machpelah , which abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of ephron the hittite , before mamre .
blind , or broken , or maimed , or having a wen , or scurvy , or scabbed , ye shall not offer these unto the lord , nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the lord .
and god said unto him in a dream , yea , i know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart ; for i also withheld thee from sinning against me : therefore suffered i thee not to touch her .
and they came to the threshingfloor of atad , which is beyond jordan , and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation : and he made a mourning for his father seven days .
either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts , that mayest thou offer for a freewill offering ; but for a vow it shall not be accepted .
now therefore restore the man his wife ; for he is a prophet , and he shall pray for thee , and thou shalt live : and if thou restore her not , know thou that thou shalt surely die , thou , and all that are thine .
and when the inhabitants of the land , the canaanites , saw the mourning in the floor of atad , they said , this is a grievous mourning to the egyptians : wherefore the name of it was called abel - mizraim , which is beyond jordan .
ye shall not offer unto the lord that which is bruised , or crushed , or broken , or cut ; neither shall ye make any offering thereof in your land .
and when abner was returned to hebron , joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly , and smote him there under the fifth rib , that he died , for the blood of asahel his brother .
and afterward when david heard it , he said , i and my kingdom are guiltless before the lord for ever from the blood of abner the son of ner :
thou knowest abner the son of ner , that he came to deceive thee , and to know thy going out and thy coming in , and to know all that thou doest .
and when joab was come out from david , he sent messengers after abner , which brought him again from the well of sirah : but david knew it not .
let it rest on the head of joab , and on all his father ' s house ; and let there not fail from the house of joab one that hath an issue , or that is a leper , or that leaneth on a staff , or that falleth on the sword , or that lacketh bread .
so abner came to david to hebron , and twenty men with him . and david made abner and the men that were with him a feast .
when joab and all the host that was with him were come , they told joab , saying , abner the son of ner came to the king , and he hath sent him away , and he is gone in peace .
then joab came to the king , and said , what hast thou done ? behold , abner came unto thee ; why is it that thou hast sent him away , and he is quite gone ?
and abner said unto david , i will arise and go , and will gather all israel unto my lord the king , that they may make a league with thee , and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth . and david sent abner away ; and he went in peace .
and , behold , the servants of david and joab came from pursuing a troop , and brought in a great spoil with them : but abner was not with david in hebron ; for he had sent him away , and he was gone in peace .
be it known unto the king , that we went into the province of judea , to the house of the great god , which is builded with great stones , and timber is laid in the walls , and this work goeth fast on , and prospereth in their hands .
the copy of the letter that tatnai , governor on this side the river , and shethar - boznai , and his companions the apharsachites , which were on this side the river , sent unto darius the king :
they sent a letter unto him , wherein was written thus ; unto darius the king , all peace .
and all the people took notice of it , and it pleased them : as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people .
say ye to the righteous , that it shall be well with him : for they shall eat the fruit of their doings .
for all the people and all israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay abner the son of ner .
and the king said unto his servants , know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in israel ?
as for my people , children are their oppressors , and women rule over them . o my people , they which lead thee cause thee to err , and destroy the way of thy paths .
and i am this day weak , though anointed king ; and these men the sons of zeruiah be too hard for me : the lord shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness .
woe unto the wicked ! it shall be ill with him : for the reward of his hands shall be given him .
and samuel said unto all israel , behold , i have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me , and have made a king over you .
so joab and abishai his brother slew abner , because he had slain their brother asahel at gibeon in the battle .
and david said to joab , and to all the people that were with him , rend your clothes , and gird you with sackcloth , and mourn before abner . and king david himself followed the bier .
and they buried abner in hebron : and the king lifted up his voice , and wept at the grave of abner ; and all the people wept .
and the king lamented over abner , and said , died abner as a fool dieth ?
thy hands were not bound , nor thy feet put into fetters : as a man falleth before wicked men , so fellest thou . and all the people wept again over him .
and when all the people came to cause david to eat meat while it was yet day , david sware , saying , so do god to me , and more also , if i taste bread , or ought else , till the sun be down .
moreover , brethren , i declare unto you the gospel which i preached unto you , which also ye have received , and wherein ye stand ;
by which also ye are saved , if ye keep in memory what i preached unto you , unless ye have believed in vain .
for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received , how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures ;
for i am the least of the apostles , that am not meet to be called an apostle , because i persecuted the church of god .
and that he was seen of cephas , then of the twelve :
after that , he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once ; of whom the greater part remain unto this present , but some are fallen asleep .
after that , he was seen of james ; then of all the apostles .
and last of all he was seen of me also , as of one born out of due time .
and the lord said unto me , arise , take thy journey before the people , that they may go in and possess the land , which i sware unto their fathers to give unto them .
the lord will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people , and the princes thereof : for ye have eaten up the vineyard ; the spoil of the poor is in your houses .
and i stayed in the mount , according to the first time , forty days and forty nights ; and the lord hearkened unto me at that time also , and the lord would not destroy thee .
he shall neither have son nor nephew among his people , nor any remaining in his dwellings .
the lord standeth up to plead , and standeth to judge the people .
to keep the commandments of the lord , and his statutes , which i command thee this day for thy good ?
he shall be driven from light into darkness , and chased out of the world .
moreover the lord saith , because the daughters of zion are haughty , and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes , walking and mincing as they go , and making a tinkling with their feet :
and now , israel , what doth the lord thy god require of thee , but to fear the lord thy god , to walk in all his ways , and to love him , and to serve the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul ,
his remembrance shall perish from the earth , and he shall have no name in the street .
what mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces , and grind the faces of the poor ? saith the lord god of hosts .
only the lord had a delight in thy fathers to love them , and he chose their seed after them , even you above all people , as it is this day .
in that day the lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet , and their cauls , and their round tires like the moon ,
behold , the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the lord ' s thy god , the earth also , with all that therein is .
therefore the lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of zion , and the lord will discover their secret parts .
for the lord your god is god of gods , and lord of lords , a great god , a mighty , and a terrible , which regardeth not persons , nor taketh reward :
circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart , and be no more stiffnecked .
the chains , and the bracelets , and the mufflers ,
he doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow , and loveth the stranger , in giving him food and raiment .
terrors shall make him afraid on every side , and shall drive him to his feet .
love ye therefore the stranger : for ye were strangers in the land of egypt .
his strength shall be hungerbitten , and destruction shall be ready at his side .
the snare is laid for him in the ground , and a trap for him in the way .
it shall dwell in his tabernacle , because it is none of his : brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation .
the bonnets , and the ornaments of the legs , and the headbands , and the tablets , and the earrings ,
his roots shall be dried up beneath , and above shall his branch be cut off .
the rings , and nose jewels ,
it shall devour the strength of his skin : even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength .
the changeable suits of apparel , and the mantles , and the wimples , and the crisping pins ,
his confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle , and it shall bring him to the king of terrors .
the glasses , and the fine linen , and the hoods , and the vails .
and her gates shall lament and mourn ; and she being desolate shall sit upon the ground .
thy fathers went down into egypt with threescore and ten persons ; and now the lord thy god hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude .
thy men shall fall by the sword , and thy mighty in the war .
he is thy praise , and he is thy god , that hath done for thee these great and terrible things , which thine eyes have seen .
and it shall come to pass , that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink ; and instead of a girdle a rent ; and instead of well set hair baldness ; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth ; and burning instead of beauty .
in that day , saith the lord of hosts , shall ye call every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree .
and he said , well ; i will make a league with thee : but one thing i require of thee , that is , thou shalt not see my face , except thou first bring michal saul ' s daughter , when thou comest to see my face .
and abner sent messengers to david on his behalf , saying , whose is the land ? saying also , make thy league with me , and , behold , my hand shall be with thee , to bring about all israel unto thee .
and he could not answer abner a word again , because he feared him .
to translate the kingdom from the house of saul , and to set up the throne of david over israel and over judah , from dan even to beer - sheba .
and abner also spake in the ears of benjamin : and abner went also to speak in the ears of david in hebron all that seemed good to israel , and that seemed good to the whole house of benjamin .
now then do it : for the lord hath spoken of david , saying , by the hand of my servant david i will save my people israel out of the hand of the philistines , and out of the hand of all their enemies .
and abner had communication with the elders of israel , saying , ye sought for david in times past to be king over you :
and her husband went with her along weeping behind her to bahurim . then said abner unto him , go , return . and he returned .
and ish - bosheth sent , and took her from her husband , even from phaltiel the son of laish .
and david sent messengers to ish - bosheth saul ' s son , saying , deliver me my wife michal , which i espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the philistines .
that brought you out of the land of egypt , to be your god : i am the lord .
neither shall ye profane my holy name ; but i will be hallowed among the children of israel : i am the lord which hallow you ,
again he measured a thousand , and brought me through the waters ; the waters were to the knees . again he measured a thousand , and brought me through ; the waters were to the loins .
and when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward , he measured a thousand cubits , and he brought me through the waters ; the waters were to the ancles .
then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward , and led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looketh eastward ; and , behold , there ran out waters on the right side .
then said he unto me , these waters issue out toward the east country , and go down into the desert , and go into the sea : which being brought forth into the sea , the waters shall be healed .
now when i had returned , behold , at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other .
and he said unto me , son of man , hast thou seen this ? then he brought me , and caused me to return to the brink of the river .
afterward he measured a thousand ; and it was a river that i could not pass over : for the waters were risen , waters to swim in , a river that could not be passed over .
and it shall come to pass , that every thing that liveth , which moveth , whithersoever the rivers shall come , shall live : and there shall be a very great multitude of fish , because these waters shall come thither : for they shall be healed ; and every thing shall live whither the river cometh .
on the same day it shall be eaten up ; ye shall leave none of it until the morrow : i am the lord .
therefore shall ye keep my commandments , and do them : i am the lord .
they that come after him shall be astonied at his day , as they that went before were affrighted .
then king jehoash called for jehoiada the priest , and the other priests , and said unto them , why repair ye not the breaches of the house ? now therefore receive no more money of your acquaintance , but deliver it for the breaches of the house .
and the priests consented to receive no more money of the people , neither to repair the breaches of the house .
let the priests take it to them , every man of his acquaintance : and let them repair the breaches of the house , wheresoever any breach shall be found .
but the high places were not taken away : the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places .
and the king took off his ring , which he had taken from haman , and gave it unto mordecai . and esther set mordecai over the house of haman .
and esther spake yet again before the king , and fell down at his feet , and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of haman the agagite , and his device that he had devised against the jews .
then the king held out the golden sceptre toward esther . so esther arose , and stood before the king ,
they were children of fools , yea , children of base men : they were viler than the earth .
and now am i their song , yea , i am their byword .
for how can i endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people ? or how can i endure to see the destruction of my kindred ?
to dwell in the clifts of the valleys , in caves of the earth , and in the rocks .
then the king ahasuerus said unto esther the queen and to mordecai the jew , behold , i have given esther the house of haman , and him they have hanged upon the gallows , because he laid his hand upon the jews .
among the bushes they brayed ; under the nettles they were gathered together .
write ye also for the jews , as it liketh you , in the king ' s name , and seal it with the king ' s ring : for the writing which is written in the king ' s name , and sealed with the king ' s ring , may no man reverse .
who cut up mallows by the bushes , and juniper roots for their meat .
they were driven forth from among men , ( they cried after them as after a thief ; )
and jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the lord all his days wherein jehoiada the priest instructed him .
in the seventh year of jehu jehoash began to reign ; and forty years reigned he in jerusalem . and his mother ' s name was zibiah of beer - sheba .
on that day did the king ahasuerus give the house of haman the jews ' enemy unto esther the queen . and mordecai came before the king ; for esther had told what he was unto her .
but now they that are younger than i have me in derision , whose fathers i would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock .
for want and famine they were solitary ; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste .
yea , whereto might the strength of their hands profit me , in whom old age was perished ?
let israel now say , that his mercy endureth for ever .
let the house of aaron now say , that his mercy endureth for ever .
let them now that fear the lord say , that his mercy endureth for ever .
i called upon the lord in distress : the lord answered me , and set me in a large place .
the lord is on my side ; i will not fear : what can man do unto me ?
the lord taketh my part with them that help me : therefore shall i see my desire upon them that hate me .
it is better to trust in the lord than to put confidence in man .
it is better to trust in the lord than to put confidence in princes .
may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth , and length , and depth , and height ;
that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith ; that ye , being rooted and grounded in love ,
that he would grant you , according to the riches of his glory , to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man ;
of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named ,
for this cause i bow my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ ,
wherefore i desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you , which is your glory .
in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him .
according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord :
to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of god ,
not a novice , lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil .
for so was it charged me by the word of the lord , saying , eat no bread , nor drink water , nor turn again by the same way that thou camest .
( for if a man know not how to rule his own house , how shall he take care of the church of god ? )
not given to wine , no striker , not greedy of filthy lucre ; but patient , not a brawler , not covetous ;
a bishop then must be blameless , the husband of one wife , vigilant , sober , of good behaviour , given to hospitality , apt to teach ;
this is a true saying , if a man desire the office of a bishop , he desireth a good work .
and , behold , there came a man of god out of judah by the word of the lord unto bethel : and jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense .
seraiah , azariah , jeremiah ,
pashur , amariah , malchijah ,
unto him be glory in the church by christ jesus throughout all ages , world without end . amen .
and he gave a sign the same day , saying , this is the sign which the lord hath spoken ; behold , the altar shall be rent , and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out .
hattush , shebaniah , malluch ,
now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think , according to the power that worketh in us ,
harim , meremoth , obadiah ,
the altar also was rent , and the ashes poured out from the altar , according to the sign which the man of god had given by the word of the lord .
holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience .
likewise must the deacons be grave , not doubletongued , not given to much wine , not greedy of filthy lucre ;
and the king said unto the man of god , come home with me , and refresh thyself , and i will give thee a reward .
moreover he must have a good report of them which are without ; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil .
and the man of god said unto the king , if thou wilt give me half thine house , i will not go in with thee , neither will i eat bread nor drink water in this place :
now those that sealed were , nehemiah , the tirshatha , the son of hachaliah , and zidkijah ,
meshullam , abijah , mijamin ,
daniel , ginnethon , baruch ,
and the levites : both jeshua the son of azaniah , binnui of the sons of henadad , kadmiel ;
maaziah , bilgai , shemaiah : these were the priests .
and to know the love of christ , which passeth knowledge , that ye might be filled with all the fulness of god .
and it came to pass , when they had brought them forth abroad , that he said , escape for thy life ; look not behind thee , neither stay thou in all the plain ; escape to the mountain , lest thou be consumed .
and lot said unto them , oh , not so , my lord :
and when the morning arose , then the angels hastened lot , saying , arise , take thy wife , and thy two daughters , which are here ; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city .
and while he lingered , the men laid hold upon his hand , and upon the hand of his wife , and upon the hand of his two daughters ; the lord being merciful unto him : and they brought him forth , and set him without the city .
behold now , thy servant hath found grace in thy sight , and thou hast magnified thy mercy , which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life ; and i cannot escape to the mountain , lest some evil take me , and i die :
and he said unto him , see , i have accepted thee concerning this thing also , that i will not overthrow this city , for the which thou hast spoken .
behold now , this city is near to flee unto , and it is a little one : oh , let me escape thither , ( is it not a little one ? ) and my soul shall live .
and he overthrew those cities , and all the plain , and all the inhabitants of the cities , and that which grew upon the ground .
then the lord rained upon sodom and upon gomorrah brimstone and fire from the lord out of heaven ;
the sun was risen upon the earth when lot entered into zoar .
haste thee , escape thither ; for i cannot do any thing till thou be come thither . therefore the name of the city was called zoar .
and when athaliah the mother of ahaziah saw that her son was dead , she arose and destroyed all the seed royal .
but jehosheba , the daughter of king joram , sister of ahaziah , took joash the son of ahaziah and stole him from among the king ' s sons which were slain ; and they hid him , even him and his nurse , in the bedchamber from athaliah , so that he was not slain .
and he was with her hid in the house of the lord six years . and athaliah did reign over the land .
and the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that jehoiada the priest commanded : and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath , with them that should go out on the sabbath , and came to jehoiada the priest .
and ye shall compass the king around about , every man with his weapons in his hand : and he that cometh within the ranges , let him be slain : and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in .
and he commanded them , saying , this is the thing that ye shall do ; a third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king ' s house ;
and two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath , even they shall keep the watch of the house of the lord about the king .
and a third part shall be at the gate of sur ; and a third part at the gate behind the guard : so shall ye keep the watch of the house , that it be not broken down .
but the men put forth their hand , and pulled lot into the house to them , and shut to the door .
and the men said unto lot , hast thou here any besides ? son in law , and thy sons , and thy daughters , and whatsoever thou hast in the city , bring them out of this place :
and they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness , both small and great : so that they wearied themselves to find the door .
for we will destroy this place , because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the lord ; and the lord hath sent us to destroy it .
o give thanks unto the lord ; for he is good : because his mercy endureth for ever .
for there is not a word in my tongue , but , lo , o lord , thou knowest it altogether .
thou compassest my path and my lying down , and art acquainted with all my ways .
such knowledge is too wonderful for me ; it is high , i cannot attain unto it .
thou hast beset me behind and before , and laid thine hand upon me .
if i ascend up into heaven , thou art there : if i make my bed in hell , behold , thou art there .
whither shall i go from thy spirit ? or whither shall i flee from thy presence ?
if i take the wings of the morning , and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea ;
him hath god exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a saviour , for to give repentance to israel , and forgiveness of sins .
the god of our fathers raised up jesus , whom ye slew and hanged on a tree .
now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things , they doubted of them whereunto this would grow .
and when they heard that , they entered into the temple early in the morning , and taught . but the high priest came , and they that were with him , and called the council together , and all the senate of the children of israel and sent to the prison to have them brought .
but when the officers came , and found them not in the prison , they returned , and told ,
and when they had brought them , they set them before the council : and the high priest asked them ,
saying , did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name ? and , behold , ye have filled jerusalem with your doctrine , and intend to bring this man ' s blood upon us .
then came one and told them , saying , behold , the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple , and teaching the people .
then went the captain with the officers , and brought them without violence : for they feared the people , lest they should have been stoned .
then peter and the other apostles answered and said , we ought to obey god rather than men .
and the other disciples came in a little ship ; ( for they were not far from land , but as it were two hundred cubits , ) dragging the net with fishes .
as soon then as they were come to land , they saw a fire of coals there , and fish laid thereon , and bread .
go , stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life .
then fell she down straightway at his feet , and yielded up the ghost : and the young men came in , and found her dead , and , carrying her forth , buried her by her husband .
thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising , thou understandest my thought afar off .
and great fear came upon all the church , and upon as many as heard these things .
o lord , thou hast searched me , and known me .
and by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people ; ( and they were all with one accord in solomon ' s porch .
and of the rest durst no man join himself to them : but the people magnified them .
and believers were the more added to the lord , multitudes both of men and women . )
insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets , and laid them on beds and couches , that at the least the shadow of peter passing by might overshadow some of them .
there came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto jerusalem , bringing sick folks , and them which were vexed with unclean spirits : and they were healed every one .
then the high priest rose up , and all they that were with him , ( which is the sect of the sadducees , ) and were filled with indignation ,
but the angel of the lord by night opened the prison doors , and brought them forth , and said ,
for every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices : wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer .
who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things , as moses was admonished of god when he was about to make the tabernacle : for , see , saith he , that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount .
but now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry , by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant , which was established upon better promises .
for if that first covenant had been faultless , then should no place have been sought for the second .
he couched , he lay down as a lion , and as a great lion : who shall stir him up ? blessed is he that blesseth thee , and cursed is he that curseth thee .
for finding fault with them , he saith , behold , the days come , saith the lord , when i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah :
god brought him forth out of egypt ; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn : he shall eat up the nations his enemies , and shall break their bones , and pierce them through with his arrows .
now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum : we have such an high priest , who is set on the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens ;
a minister of the sanctuary , and of the true tabernacle , which the lord pitched , and not man .
for they are life unto those that find them , and health to all their flesh .
my son , attend to my words ; incline thine ear unto my sayings .
for he hath made him to be sin for us , who knew no sin ; that we might be made the righteousness of god in him .
turn not to the right hand nor to the left : remove thy foot from evil .
let thine eyes look right on , and let thine eyelids look straight before thee .
ponder the path of thy feet , and let all thy ways be established .
now then we are ambassadors for christ , as though god did beseech you by us : we pray you in christ ' s stead , be ye reconciled to god .
keep thy heart with all diligence ; for out of it are the issues of life .
put away from thee a froward mouth , and perverse lips put far from thee .
then jesus saith unto them , children , have ye any meat ? they answered him , no .
but when the morning was now come , jesus stood on the shore : but the disciples knew not that it was jesus .
and he said unto them , cast the net on the right side of the ship , and ye shall find . they cast therefore , and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes .
after these things jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of tiberias ; and on this wise shewed he himself .
simon peter saith unto them , i go a fishing . they say unto him , we also go with thee . they went forth , and entered into a ship immediately ; and that night they caught nothing .
there were together simon peter , and thomas called didymus , and nathanael of cana in galilee , and the sons of zebedee , and two other of his disciples .
and to him they agreed : and when they had called the apostles , and beaten them , they commanded that they should not speak in the name of jesus , and let them go .
and daily in the temple , and in every house , they ceased not to teach and preach jesus christ .
and they departed from the presence of the council , rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name .
after this man rose up judas of galilee in the days of the taxing , and drew away much people after him : he also perished ; and all , even as many as obeyed him , were dispersed .
to wit , that god was in christ , reconciling the world unto himself , not imputing their trespasses unto them ; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation .
and now i say unto you , refrain from these men , and let them alone : for if this counsel or this work be of men , it will come to nought :
and all things are of god , who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ , and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation ;
but if it be of god , ye cannot overthrow it ; lest haply ye be found even to fight against god .
therefore if any man be in christ , he is a new creature : old things are passed away ; behold , all things are become new .
and we are his witnesses of these things ; and so is also the holy ghost , whom god hath given to them that obey him .
wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh : yea , though we have known christ after the flesh , yet now henceforth know we him no more .
when they heard that , they were cut to the heart , and took counsel to slay them .
and that he died for all , that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves , but unto him which died for them , and rose again .
for the love of christ constraineth us ; because we thus judge , that if one died for all , then were all dead :
and said unto them , ye men of israel , take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men .
for whether we be beside ourselves , it is to god : or whether we be sober , it is for your cause .
as the valleys are they spread forth , as gardens by the river ' s side , as the trees of lign aloes which the lord hath planted , and as cedar trees beside the waters .
for we commend not ourselves again unto you , but give you occasion to glory on our behalf , that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance , and not in heart .
he shall pour the water out of his buckets , and his seed shall be in many waters , and his king shall be higher than agag , and his kingdom shall be exalted .
knowing therefore the terror of the lord , we persuade men ; but we are made manifest unto god ; and i trust also are made manifest in your consciences .
he hath said , which heard the words of god , which saw the vision of the almighty , falling into a trance , but having his eyes open :
for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ ; that every one may receive the things done in his body , according to that he hath done , whether it be good or bad .
how goodly are thy tents , o jacob , and thy tabernacles , o israel !
and balaam lifted up his eyes , and he saw israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes ; and the spirit of god came upon him .
and he took up his parable , and said , balaam the son of beor hath said , and the man whose eyes are open hath said :
and when balaam saw that it pleased the lord to bless israel , he went not , as at other times , to seek for enchantments , but he set his face toward the wilderness .
and these things , brethren , i have in a figure transferred to myself and to apollos for your sakes ; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written , that no one of you be puffed up for one against another .
therefore judge nothing before the time , until the lord come , who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness , and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts : and then shall every man have praise of god .
for i know nothing by myself ; yet am i not hereby justified : but he that judgeth me is the lord .
but with me it is a very small thing that i should be judged of you , or of man ' s judgment : yea , i judge not mine own self .
moreover it is required in stewards , that a man be found faithful .
let a man so account of us , as of the ministers of christ , and stewards of the mysteries of god .
avoid it , pass not by it , turn from it , and pass away .
enter not into the path of the wicked , and go not in the way of evil men .
take fast hold of instruction ; let her not go : keep her ; for she is thy life .
when thou goest , thy steps shall not be straitened ; and when thou runnest , thou shalt not stumble .
the way of the wicked is as darkness : they know not at what they stumble .
but the path of the just is as the shining light , that shineth more and more unto the perfect day .
for they eat the bread of wickedness , and drink the wine of violence .
for they sleep not , except they have done mischief ; and their sleep is taken away , unless they cause some to fall .
and they said unto the messengers that came , thus shall ye say unto the men of jabesh - gilead , to morrow , by that time the sun be hot , ye shall have help . and the messengers came and shewed it to the men of jabesh ; and they were glad .
for who maketh thee to differ from another ? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive ? now if thou didst receive it , why dost thou glory , as if thou hadst not received it ?
then came the messengers to gibeah of saul , and told the tidings in the ears of the people : and all the people lifted up their voices , and wept .
i have taught thee in the way of wisdom ; i have led thee in right paths .
now ye are full , now ye are rich , ye have reigned as kings without us : and i would to god ye did reign , that we also might reign with you .
and the elders of jabesh said unto him , give us seven days ' respite , that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of israel : and then , if there be no man to save us , we will come out to thee .
hear , o my son , and receive my sayings ; and the years of thy life shall be many .
and the spirit of god came upon saul when he heard those tidings , and his anger was kindled greatly .
and , behold , saul came after the herd out of the field ; and saul said , what aileth the people that they weep ? and they told him the tidings of the men of jabesh .
i would that ye all spake with tongues , but rather that ye prophesied : for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues , except he interpret , that the church may receive edifying .
he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself ; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church .
but he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification , and exhortation , and comfort .
philip answered him , two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them , that every one of them may take a little .
for he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men , but unto god : for no man understandeth him ; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries .
now we know that what things soever the law saith , it saith to them who are under the law : that every mouth may be stopped , and all the world may become guilty before god .
one of his disciples , andrew , simon peter ' s brother , saith unto him ,
follow after charity , and desire spiritual gifts , but rather that ye may prophesy .
destruction and misery are in their ways :
and the way of peace have they not known :
whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness :
their feet are swift to shed blood :
they are all gone out of the way , they are together become unprofitable ; there is none that doeth good , no , not one .
after these things jesus went over the sea of galilee , which is the sea of tiberias .
their throat is an open sepulchre ; with their tongues they have used deceit ; the poison of asps is under their lips :
and a great multitude followed him , because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased .
as it is written , there is none righteous , no , not one :
there is none that understandeth , there is none that seeketh after god .
when jesus then lifted up his eyes , and saw a great company come unto him , he saith unto philip , whence shall we buy bread , that these may eat ?
for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound , who shall prepare himself to the battle ?
and this he said to prove him : for he himself knew what he would do .
and even things without life giving sound , whether pipe or harp , except they give a distinction in the sounds , how shall it be known what is piped or harped ?
and jesus went up into a mountain , and there he sat with his disciples .
now , brethren , if i come unto you speaking with tongues , what shall i profit you , except i shall speak to you either by revelation , or by knowledge , or by prophesying , or by doctrine ?
and the passover , a feast of the jews , was nigh .
then nahash the ammonite came up , and encamped against jabesh - gilead : and all the men of jabesh said unto nahash , make a covenant with us , and we will serve thee .
and nahash the ammonite answered them , on this condition will i make a covenant with you , that i may thrust out all your right eyes , and lay it for a reproach upon all israel .
then the prophets , haggai the prophet , and zechariah the son of iddo , prophesied unto the jews that were in judah and jerusalem in the name of the god of israel , even unto them .
then said we unto them after this manner , what are the names of the men that make this building ?
but the eye of their god was upon the elders of the jews , that they could not cause them to cease , till the matter came to darius : and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter .
then rose up zerubbabel the son of shealtiel , and jeshua the son of jozadak , and began to build the house of god which is at jerusalem : and with them were the prophets of god helping them .
at the same time came to them tatnai , governor on this side the river , and shethar - boznai , and their companions , and said thus unto them , who hath commanded you to build this house , and to make up this wall ?
is he the god of the jews only ? is he not also of the gentiles ? yes , of the gentiles also :
whom god hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood , to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past , through the forbearance of god ;
to declare , i say , at this time his righteousness : that he might be just , and the justifier of him which believeth in jesus .
where is boasting then ? it is excluded . by what law ? of works ? nay : but by the law of faith .
therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law .
but now the righteousness of god without the law is manifested , being witnessed by the law and the prophets ;
even the righteousness of god which is by faith of jesus christ unto all and upon all them that believe : for there is no difference :
for all have sinned , and come short of the glory of god ;
being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus :
therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight : for by the law is the knowledge of sin .
thou wilt shew me the path of life : in thy presence is fulness of joy ; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore .
for thou wilt not leave my soul in hell ; neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption .
seeing it is one god , which shall justify the circumcision by faith , and uncircumcision through faith .
when he was set down on the judgment seat , his wife sent unto him , saying , have thou nothing to do with that just man : for i have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him .
for he knew that for envy they had delivered him .
therefore when they were gathered together , pilate said unto them , whom will ye that i release unto you ? barabbas , or jesus which is called christ ?
and they had then a notable prisoner , called barabbas .
now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner , whom they would .
and he answered him to never a word ; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly .
then said pilate unto him , hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee ?
and when he was accused of the chief priests and elders , he answered nothing .
and gave them for the potter ' s field , as the lord appointed me .
and jesus stood before the governor : and the governor asked him , saying , art thou the king of the jews ? and jesus said unto him , thou sayest .
i will be surety for him ; of my hand shalt thou require him : if i bring him not unto thee , and set him before thee , then let me bear the blame for ever :
and they said , the man asked us straitly of our state , and of our kindred , saying , is your father yet alive ? have ye another brother ? and we told him according to the tenor of these words : could we certainly know that he would say , bring your brother down ?
and judah said unto israel his father , send the lad with me , and we will arise and go ; that we may live , and not die , both we , and thou , and also our little ones .
but if thou wilt not send him , we will not go down : for the man said unto us , ye shall not see my face , except your brother be with you .
and set up over his head his accusation written , this is jesus the king of the jews .
and sitting down they watched him there ;
and they crucified him , and parted his garments , casting lots : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet , they parted my garments among them , and upon my vesture did they cast lots .
they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall : and when he had tasted thereof , he would not drink .
and they that passed by reviled him , wagging their heads ,
then were there two thieves crucified with him , one on the right hand , and another on the left .
also he built beth - horon the upper , and beth - horon the nether , fenced cities , with walls , gates , and bars ;
and baalath , and all the store cities that solomon had , and all the chariot cities , and the cities of the horsemen , and all that solomon desired to build in jerusalem , and in lebanon , and throughout all the land of his dominion .
as for all the people that were left of the hittites , and the amorites , and the perizzites , and the hivites , and the jebusites , which were not of israel ,
but of their children , who were left after them in the land , whom the children of israel consumed not , them did solomon make to pay tribute until this day .
and it came to pass at the end of twenty years , wherein solomon had built the house of the lord , and his own house ,
and as they came out , they found a man of cyrene , simon by name : him they compelled to bear his cross .
that the cities which huram had restored to solomon , solomon built them , and caused the children of israel to dwell there .
and when they were come unto a place called golgotha , that is to say , a place of a skull ,
and they spit upon him , and took the reed , and smote him on the head .
and he built tadmor in the wilderness , and all the store cities , which he built in hamath .
and after that they had mocked him , they took the robe off from him , and put his own raiment on him , and led him away to crucify him .
if thou wilt send our brother with us , we will go down and buy thee food :
and judah spake unto him , saying , the man did solemnly protest unto us , saying , ye shall not see my face , except your brother be with you .
and it came to pass , when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of egypt , their father said unto them , go again , buy us a little food .
and the younger , she also bare a son , and called his name benammi : the same is the father of the children of ammon unto this day .
and the firstborn bare a son , and called his name moab : the same is the father of the moabites unto this day .
and they made their father drink wine that night also : and the younger arose , and lay with him ; and he perceived not when she lay down , nor when she arose .
thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee , whom the lord thy god shall choose : one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee : thou mayest not set a stranger over thee , which is not thy brother .
thus were both the daughters of lot with child by their father .
but he shall not multiply horses to himself , nor cause the people to return to egypt , to the end that he should multiply horses : forasmuch as the lord hath said unto you , ye shall henceforth return no more that way .
and they made their father drink wine that night : and the firstborn went in , and lay with her father ; and he perceived not when she lay down , nor when she arose .
and all the people shall hear , and fear , and do no more presumptuously .
and it came to pass on the morrow , that the firstborn said unto the younger , behold , i lay yesternight with my father : let us make him drink wine this night also ; and go thou in , and lie with him , that we may preserve seed of our father .
when thou art come unto the land which the lord thy god giveth thee , and shalt possess it , and shalt dwell therein , and shalt say , i will set a king over me , like as all the nations that are about me ;
and the firstborn said unto the younger , our father is old , and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth :
according to the sentence of the law which they shall teach thee , and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee , thou shalt do : thou shalt not decline from the sentence which they shall shew thee , to the right hand , nor to the left .
come , let us make our father drink wine , and we will lie with him , that we may preserve seed of our father .
and the man that will do presumptuously , and will not hearken unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the lord thy god , or unto the judge , even that man shall die : and thou shalt put away the evil from israel .
and thou shalt do according to the sentence , which they of that place which the lord shall choose shall shew thee ; and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they inform thee :
when pilate saw that he could prevail nothing , but that rather a tumult was made , he took water , and washed his hands before the multitude , saying , i am innocent of the blood of this just person : see ye to it .
and the governor said , why , what evil hath he done ? but they cried out the more , saying , let him be crucified .
then released he barabbas unto them : and when he had scourged jesus , he delivered him to be crucified .
then answered all the people , and said , his blood be on us , and on our children .
and it shall be with him , and he shall read therein all the days of his life : that he may learn to fear the lord his god , to keep all the words of this law and these statutes , to do them :
and they stripped him , and put on him a scarlet robe .
then the soldiers of the governor took jesus into the common hall , and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers .
neither shall he multiply wives to himself , that his heart turn not away : neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold .
but of the children of israel did solomon make no servants for his work ; but they were men of war , and chief of his captains , and captains of his chariots and horsemen .
and it shall be , when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom , that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests the levites :
and when they had platted a crown of thorns , they put it upon his head , and a reed in his right hand : and they bowed the knee before him , and mocked him , saying , hail , king of the jews !
but the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask barabbas , and destroy jesus .
the governor answered and said unto them , whether of the twain will ye that i release unto you ? they said , barabbas .
and it came to pass , when god destroyed the cities of the plain , that god remembered abraham , and sent lot out of the midst of the overthrow , when he overthrew the cities in the which lot dwelt .
and he looked toward sodom and gomorrah , and toward all the land of the plain , and beheld , and , lo , the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace .
and abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the lord :
but his wife looked back from behind him , and she became a pillar of salt .
and saying , thou that destroyest the temple , and buildest it in three days , save thyself . if thou be the son of god , come down from the cross .
and joktan begat almodad , and sheleph , and hazarmaveth , and jerah ,
the thieves also , which were crucified with him , cast the same in his teeth .
he trusted in god ; let him deliver him now , if he will have him : for he said , i am the son of god .
he saved others ; himself he cannot save . if he be the king of israel , let him now come down from the cross , and we will believe him .
likewise also the chief priests mocking him , with the scribes and elders , said ,
and pathrusim , and casluhim , ( of whom came the philistines , ) and caphthorim .
some of them that stood there , when they heard that , said , this man calleth for elias .
and canaan begat zidon his firstborn , and heth ,
and straightway one of them ran , and took a spunge , and filled it with vinegar , and put it on a reed , and gave him to drink .
and cush begat nimrod : he began to be mighty upon the earth .
and the captain of the lord ' s host said unto joshua , loose thy shoe from off thy foot ; for the place whereon thou standest is holy . and joshua did so .
now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour .
and mizraim begat ludim , and anamim , and lehabim , and naphtuhim ,
and he said , nay ; but as captain of the host of the lord am i now come . and joshua fell on his face to the earth , and did worship , and said unto him , what saith my lord unto his servant ?
and about the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice , saying , eli , eli , lama sabachthani ? that is to say , my god , my god , why hast thou forsaken me ?
blessed be the lord thy god , which delighted in thee to set thee on his throne , to be king for the lord thy god : because thy god loved israel , to establish them for ever , therefore made he thee king over them , to do judgment and justice .
and the arvadite , and the zemarite , and the hamathite .
and she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold , and of spices great abundance , and precious stones : neither was there any such spice as the queen of sheba gave king solomon .
the sons of shem ; elam , and asshur , and arphaxad , and lud , and aram , and uz , and hul , and gether , and meshech .
the rest said , let be , let us see whether elias will come to save him .
and the hivite , and the arkite , and the sinite ,
and arphaxad begat shelah , and shelah begat eber .
and unto eber were born two sons : the name of the one was peleg ; because in his days the earth was divided : and his brother ' s name was joktan .
and the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land ; neither had the children of israel manna any more ; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of canaan that year .
and they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover , unleavened cakes , and parched corn in the selfsame day .
and the children of israel encamped in gilgal , and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of jericho .
and abraham circumcised his son isaac being eight days old , as god had commanded him .
and the lord visited sarah as he had said , and the lord did unto sarah as he had spoken .
for sarah conceived , and bare abraham a son in his old age , at the set time of which god had spoken to him .
happy are thy men , and happy are these thy servants , which stand continually before thee , and hear thy wisdom .
howbeit i believed not their words , until i came , and mine eyes had seen it : and , behold , the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me : for thou exceedest the fame that i heard .
and she said to the king , it was a true report which i heard in mine own land of thine acts , and of thy wisdom :
and , behold , the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom ; and the earth did quake , and the rocks rent ;
and the meat of his table , and the sitting of his servants , and the attendance of his ministers , and their apparel ; his cupbearers also , and their apparel ; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the lord ; there was no more spirit in her .
jesus , when he had cried again with a loud voice , yielded up the ghost .
and when the queen of sheba had seen the wisdom of solomon , and the house that he had built ,
and came out of the graves after his resurrection , and went into the holy city , and appeared unto many .
and solomon told her all her questions : and there was nothing hid from solomon which he told her not .
and the graves were opened ; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose ,
now when the centurion , and they that were with him , watching jesus , saw the earthquake , and those things that were done , they feared greatly , saying , truly this was the son of god .
among which was mary magdalene , and mary the mother of james and joses , and the mother of zebedee ' s children .
when the even was come , there came a rich man of arimathaea , named joseph , who also himself was jesus ' disciple :
he that giveth unto the poor shall not lack : but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse .
he went to pilate , and begged the body of jesus . then pilate commanded the body to be delivered .
when the wicked rise , men hide themselves : but when they perish , the righteous increase .
and when joseph had taken the body , he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth ,
and the child grew , and was weaned : and abraham made a great feast the same day that isaac was weaned .
and she said , who would have said unto abraham , that sarah should have given children suck ? for i have born him a son in his old age .
and sarah said , god hath made me to laugh , so that all that hear will laugh with me .
and abraham was an hundred years old , when his son isaac was born unto him .
and sarah saw the son of hagar the egyptian , which she had born unto abraham , mocking .
the sons of ezer ; bilhan , and zavan , and jakan . the sons of dishan ; uz , and aran .
whoso robbeth his father or his mother , and saith , it is no transgression ; the same is the companion of a destroyer .
so they went , and made the sepulchre sure , sealing the stone , and setting a watch .
the sons of anah ; dishon . and the sons of dishon ; amram , and eshban , and ithran , and cheran .
he that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue .
pilate said unto them , ye have a watch : go your way , make it as sure as ye can .
the sons of shobal ; alian , and manahath , and ebal , shephi , and onam . and the sons of zibeon ; aiah , and anah .
he that trusteth in his own heart is a fool : but whoso walketh wisely , he shall be delivered .
command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day , lest his disciples come by night , and steal him away , and say unto the people , he is risen from the dead : so the last error shall be worse than the first .
saying , sir , we remember that that deceiver said , while he was yet alive , after three days i will rise again .
a faithful man shall abound with blessings : but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent .
now the next day , that followed the day of the preparation , the chief priests and pharisees came together unto pilate ,
and there was mary magdalene , and the other mary , sitting over against the sepulchre .
he that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye , and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him .
and laid it in his own new tomb , which he had hewn out in the rock : and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre , and departed .
to have respect of persons is not good : for for a piece of bread that man will transgress .
and the sons of seir ; lotan , and shobal , and zibeon , and anah , and dishon , and ezer , and dishan .
and the sons of lothan ; hori , and homam : and timna was lotan ' s sister .
the sons of eliphaz ; teman , and omar , zephi , and gatam , kenaz , and timna , and amalek .
the sons of reuel ; nahath , zerah , shammah , and mizzah .
and abraham begat isaac . the sons of isaac ; esau and israel .
the prince that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor : but he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days .
the sons of esau ; eliphaz , reuel , and jeush , and jaalam , and korah .
a man that doeth violence to the blood of any person shall flee to the pit ; let no man stay him .
now the sons of keturah , abraham ' s concubine : she bare zimran , and jokshan , and medan , and midian , and ishbak , and shuah . and the sons of jokshan ; sheba , and dedan .
whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved : but he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once .
and the sons of midian ; ephah , and epher , and henoch , and abida , and eldaah . all these are the sons of keturah .
he that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread : but he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough .
mine eye is consumed because of grief ; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies .
i am weary with my groaning ; all the night make i my bed to swim ; i water my couch with my tears .
for in death there is no remembrance of thee : in the grave who shall give thee thanks ?
return , o lord , deliver my soul : oh save me for thy mercies ' sake .
the lord hath heard my supplication ; the lord will receive my prayer .
depart from me , all ye workers of iniquity ; for the lord hath heard the voice of my weeping .
o lord , rebuke me not in thine anger , neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure .
have mercy upon me , o lord ; for i am weak : o lord , heal me ; for my bones are vexed .
my soul is also sore vexed : but thou , o lord , how long ?
as a roaring lion , and a ranging bear ; so is a wicked ruler over the poor people .
happy is the man that feareth alway : but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief .
jetur , naphish , and kedemah . these are the sons of ishmael .
he that covereth his sins shall not prosper : but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy .
mishma and dumah , massa , hadad , and tema ,
when righteous men do rejoice , there is great glory : but when the wicked rise , a man is hidden .
the rich man is wise in his own conceit ; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out .
whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way , he shall fall himself into his own pit : but the upright shall have good things in possession .
eber , peleg , reu ,
serug , nahor , terah ,
abram ; the same is abraham .
the sons of abraham ; isaac , and ishmael .
hadoram also , and uzal , and diklah ,
and ebal , and abimael , and sheba ,
and ophir , and havilah , and jobab . all these were the sons of joktan .
shem , arphaxad , shelah ,
these are their generations : the firstborn of ishmael , nebaioth ; then kedar , and adbeel , and mibsam ,
thus were they defiled with their own works , and went a whoring with their own inventions .
and shed innocent blood , even the blood of their sons and of their daughters , whom they sacrificed unto the idols of canaan : and the land was polluted with blood .
but were mingled among the heathen , and learned their works .
they did not destroy the nations , concerning whom the lord commanded them :
yea , they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils ,
and they served their idols : which were a snare unto them .
and that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore .
behold , i will command , saith the lord , and cause them to return to this city ; and they shall fight against it , and take it , and burn it with fire : and i will make the cities of judah a desolation without an inhabitant .
then stood up phinehas , and executed judgment : and so the plague was stayed .
because they provoked his spirit , so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips .
i will even give them into the hand of their enemies , and into the hand of them that seek their life : and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven , and to the beasts of the earth .
and zedekiah king of judah and his princes will i give into the hand of their enemies , and into the hand of them that seek their life , and into the hand of the king of babylon ' s army , which are gone up from you .
therefore was the wrath of the lord kindled against his people , insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance .
now when the adversaries of judah and benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the lord god of israel ;
and i will give the men that have transgressed my covenant , which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me , when they cut the calf in twain , and passed between the parts thereof ,
and in the reign of ahasuerus , in the beginning of his reign , wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of judah and jerusalem .
and hired counsellers against them , to frustrate their purpose , all the days of cyrus king of persia , even until the reign of darius king of persia .
the princes of judah , and the princes of jerusalem , the eunuchs , and the priests , and all the people of the land , which passed between the parts of the calf ;
blessed be the lord god of israel from everlasting to everlasting : and let all the people say , amen . praise ye the lord .
thus saith the lord , the god of israel ; i made a covenant with your fathers in the day that i brought them forth out of the land of egypt , out of the house of bondmen , saying ,
save us , o lord our god , and gather us from among the heathen , to give thanks unto thy holy name , and to triumph in thy praise .
at the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an hebrew , which hath been sold unto thee ; and when he hath served thee six years , thou shalt let him go free from thee : but your fathers hearkened not unto me , neither inclined their ear .
he made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives .
and ye were now turned , and had done right in my sight , in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour ; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name :
and he remembered for them his covenant , and repented according to the multitude of his mercies .
but ye turned and polluted my name , and caused every man his servant , and every man his handmaid , whom ye had set at liberty at their pleasure , to return , and brought them into subjection , to be unto you for servants and for handmaids .
nevertheless he regarded their affliction , when he heard their cry :
many times did he deliver them ; but they provoked him with their counsel , and were brought low for their iniquity .
now when all the princes , and all the people , which had entered into the covenant , heard that every one should let his manservant , and every one his maidservant , go free , that none should serve themselves of them any more , then they obeyed , and let them go .
their enemies also oppressed them , and they were brought into subjection under their hand .
but afterward they turned , and caused the servants and the handmaids , whom they had let go free , to return , and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids .
and he gave them into the hand of the heathen ; and they that hated them ruled over them .
therefore the word of the lord came to jeremiah from the lord , saying ,
and in the days of artaxerxes wrote bishlam , mithredath , tabeel , and the rest of their companions , unto artaxerxes king of persia ; and the writing of the letter was written in the syrian tongue , and interpreted in the syrian tongue .
rehum the chancellor and shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against jerusalem to artaxerxes the king in this sort :
then again the pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight . he said unto them , he put clay upon mine eyes , and i washed , and do see .
therefore said some of the pharisees , this man is not of god , because he keepeth not the sabbath day . others said , how can a man that is a sinner do such miracles ? and there was a division among them .
they say unto the blind man again , what sayest thou of him , that he hath opened thine eyes ? he said , he is a prophet .
but the jews did not believe concerning him , that he had been blind , and received his sight , until they called the parents of him that had received his sight .
and they asked them , saying , is this your son , who ye say was born blind ? how then doth he now see ?
therefore said they unto him , how were thine eyes opened ?
he answered and said , a man that is called jesus made clay , and anointed mine eyes , and said unto me , go to the pool of siloam , and wash : and i went and washed , and i received sight .
and it was the sabbath day when jesus made the clay , and opened his eyes .
they brought to the pharisees him that aforetime was blind .
without father , without mother , without descent , having neither beginning of days , nor end of life ; but made like unto the son of god ; abideth a priest continually .
to whom also abraham gave a tenth part of all ; first being by interpretation king of righteousness , and after that also king of salem , which is , king of peace ;
for this melchisedec , king of salem , priest of the most high god , who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings , and blessed him ;
and without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better .
and verily they that are of the sons of levi , who receive the office of the priesthood , have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law , that is , of their brethren , though they come out of the loins of abraham :
now consider how great this man was , unto whom even the patriarch abraham gave the tenth of the spoils .
and as i may so say , levi also , who receiveth tithes , payed tithes in abraham .
and here men that die receive tithes ; but there he receiveth them , of whom it is witnessed that he liveth .
and their pillars were four , and their sockets of brass four ; their hooks of silver , and the overlaying of their chapiters and their fillets of silver .
there was none of the anakims left in the land of the children of israel : only in gaza , in gath , and in ashdod , there remained .
and the hanging for the gate of the court was needlework , of blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen : and twenty cubits was the length , and the height in the breadth was five cubits , answerable to the hangings of the court .
so joshua took the whole land , according to all that the lord said unto moses ; and joshua gave it for an inheritance unto israel according to their divisions by their tribes . and the land rested from war .
and the sockets for the pillars were of brass ; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver ; and the overlaying of their chapiters of silver ; and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver .
for it was of the lord to harden their hearts , that they should come against israel in battle , that he might destroy them utterly , and that they might have no favour , but that he might destroy them , as the lord commanded moses .
all the hangings of the court round about were of fine twined linen .
and at that time came joshua , and cut off the anakims from the mountains , from hebron , from debir , from anab , and from all the mountains of judah , and from all the mountains of israel : joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities .
their pillars were twenty , and their brasen sockets twenty ; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver .
the hangings of the one side of the gate were fifteen cubits ; their pillars three , and their sockets three .
and for the other side of the court gate , on this hand and that hand , were hangings of fifteen cubits ; their pillars three , and their sockets three .
and for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits , their pillars ten , and their sockets ten ; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver .
and for the east side eastward fifty cubits .
and of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels he made hooks for the pillars , and overlaid their chapiters , and filleted them .
for as yet they knew not the scripture , that he must rise again from the dead .
and of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of the sanctuary , and the sockets of the vail ; an hundred sockets of the hundred talents , a talent for a socket .
and the brass of the offering was seventy talents , and two thousand and four hundred shekels .
and the people blessed all the men , that willingly offered themselves to dwell at jerusalem .
and the rulers of the people dwelt at jerusalem : the rest of the people also cast lots , to bring one of ten to dwell in jerusalem the holy city , and nine parts to dwell in other cities .
and at jerusalem dwelt certain of the children of judah , and of the children of benjamin . of the children of judah ; athaiah the son of uzziah , the son of zechariah , the son of amariah , the son of shephatiah , the son of mahalaleel , of the children of perez ;
now these are the chief of the province that dwelt in jerusalem : but in the cities of judah dwelt every one in his possession in their cities , to wit , israel , the priests , and the levites , and the nethinims , and the children of solomon ' s servants .
and maaseiah the son of baruch , the son of col - hozeh , the son of hazaiah , the son of adaiah , the son of joiarib , the son of zechariah , the son of shiloni .
all the sons of perez that dwelt at jerusalem were four hundred threescore and eight valiant men .
and these are the sons of benjamin ; sallu the son of meshullam , the son of joed , the son of pedaiah , the son of kolaiah , the son of maaseiah , the son of ithiel , the son of jesaiah .
and after him gabbai , sallai , nine hundred twenty and eight .
and joel the son of zichri was their overseer : and judah the son of senuah was second over the city .
and all the pins of the tabernacle , and of the court round about , were of brass .
this is the sum of the tabernacle , even of the tabernacle of testimony , as it was counted , according to the commandment of moses , for the service of the levites , by the hand of ithamar , son to aaron the priest .
and bezaleel the son of uri , the son of hur , of the tribe of judah , made all that the lord commanded moses .
and with him was aholiab , son of ahisamach , of the tribe of dan , an engraver , and a cunning workman , and an embroiderer in blue , and in purple , and in scarlet , and fine linen .
all the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of the holy place , even the gold of the offering , was twenty and nine talents , and seven hundred and thirty shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary .
and the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation was an hundred talents , and a thousand seven hundred and threescore and fifteen shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary :
a bekah for every man , that is , half a shekel , after the shekel of the sanctuary , for every one that went to be numbered , from twenty years old and upward , for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty men .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
and after that went the levites in to do their service in the tabernacle of the congregation before aaron , and before his sons : as the lord had commanded moses concerning the levites , so did they unto them .
and moses , and aaron , and all the congregation of the children of israel , did to the levites according unto all that the lord commanded moses concerning the levites , so did the children of israel unto them .
but shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the congregation , to keep the charge , and shall do no service . thus shalt thou do unto the levites touching their charge .
and parmashta , and arisai , and aridai , and vajezatha ,
and from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the service thereof , and shall serve no more :
this is it that belongeth unto the levites : from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the congregation :
and the sockets of the court round about , and the sockets of the court gate , and all the pins of the tabernacle , and all the pins of the court round about .
and therewith he made the sockets to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , and the brasen altar , and the brasen grate for it , and all the vessels of the altar ,
thus the jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword , and slaughter , and destruction , and did what they would unto those that hated them .
and in shushan the palace the jews slew and destroyed five hundred men .
and parshandatha , and dalphon , and aspatha ,
and poratha , and adalia , and aridatha ,
now also many nations are gathered against thee , that say , let her be defiled , and let our eye look upon zion .
the jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king ahasuerus , to lay hand on such as sought their hurt : and no man could withstand them ; for the fear of them fell upon all people .
and all the rulers of the provinces , and the lieutenants , and the deputies , and officers of the king , helped the jews ; because the fear of mordecai fell upon them .
arise and thresh , o daughter of zion : for i will make thine horn iron , and i will make thy hoofs brass : and thou shalt beat in pieces many people : and i will consecrate their gain unto the lord , and their substance unto the lord of the whole earth .
for mordecai was great in the king ' s house , and his fame went out throughout all the provinces : for this man mordecai waxed greater and greater .
but they know not the thoughts of the lord , neither understand they his counsel : for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor .
and some of the pharisees which were with him heard these words , and said unto him , are we blind also ?
and he said , lord , i believe . and he worshipped him .
for his merciful kindness is great toward us : and the truth of the lord endureth for ever . praise ye the lord .
and jesus said unto him , thou hast both seen him , and it is he that talketh with thee .
o praise the lord , all ye nations : praise him , all ye people .
and jesus said , for judgment i am come into this world , that they which see not might see ; and that they which see might be made blind .
and by the border of ephraim , from the east side even unto the west side , a portion for reuben .
and by the border of reuben , from the east side unto the west side , a portion for judah .
and by the border of naphtali , from the east side unto the west side , a portion for manasseh .
and by the border of manasseh , from the east side unto the west side , a portion for ephraim .
and by the border of dan , from the east side unto the west side , a portion for asher .
and by the border of asher , from the east side even unto the west side , a portion for naphtali .
now these are the names of the tribes . from the north end to the coast of the way of hethlon , as one goeth to hamath , hazar - enan , the border of damascus northward , to the coast of hamath ; for these are his sides east and west ; a portion for dan .
if this man were not of god , he could do nothing .
they answered and said unto him , thou wast altogether born in sins , and dost thou teach us ? and they cast him out .
jesus heard that they had cast him out ; and when he had found him , he said unto him , dost thou believe on the son of god ?
he answered and said , who is he , lord , that i might believe on him ?
the man answered and said unto them , why herein is a marvellous thing , that ye know not from whence he is , and yet he hath opened mine eyes .
now we know that god heareth not sinners : but if any man be a worshipper of god , and doeth his will , him he heareth .
since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind .
the oblation that ye shall offer unto the lord shall be of five and twenty thousand in length , and of ten thousand in breadth .
thus shalt thou separate the levites from among the children of israel : and the levites shall be mine .
and they spake unto him , saying , if thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day , and wilt serve them , and answer them , and speak good words to them , then they will be thy servants for ever .
and thou shalt set the levites before aaron , and before his sons , and offer them for an offering unto the lord .
in like manner also , that women adorn themselves in modest apparel , with shamefacedness and sobriety ; not with broided hair , or gold , or pearls , or costly array ;
but he forsook the counsel of the old men , which they had given him , and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him , and which stood before him :
for they are wholly given unto me from among the children of israel ; instead of such as open every womb , even instead of the firstborn of all the children of israel , have i taken them unto me .
i will therefore that men pray every where , lifting up holy hands , without wrath and doubting .
and he said unto them , what counsel give ye that we may answer this people , who have spoken to me , saying , make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter ?
and after that shall the levites go in to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation : and thou shalt cleanse them , and offer them for an offering .
we know that god spake unto moses : as for this fellow , we know not from whence he is .
and it came to pass , when jeroboam the son of nebat , who was yet in egypt , heard of it , ( for he was fled from the presence of king solomon , and jeroboam dwelt in egypt ; )
and thou shalt bring the levites before the lord : and the children of israel shall put their hands upon the levites :
then they reviled him , and said , thou art his disciple ; but we are moses ' disciples .
that they sent and called him . and jeroboam and all the congregation of israel came , and spake unto rehoboam , saying ,
he answered them , i have told you already , and ye did not hear : wherefore would ye hear it again ? will ye also be his disciples ?
thy father made our yoke grievous : now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father , and his heavy yoke which he put upon us , lighter , and we will serve thee .
and the levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks : and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering , unto the lord , to make an atonement for the levites .
then said they to him again , what did he to thee ? how opened he thine eyes ?
and he said unto them , depart yet for three days , then come again to me . and the people departed .
and aaron shall offer the levites before the lord for an offering of the children of israel , that they may execute the service of the lord .
for this is good and acceptable in the sight of god our saviour ;
for kings , and for all that are in authority ; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty .
i exhort therefore , that , first of all , supplications , prayers , intercessions , and giving of thanks , be made for all men ;
whereunto i am ordained a preacher , and an apostle , ( i speak the truth in christ , and lie not ; ) a teacher of the gentiles in faith and verity .
who will have all men to be saved , and to come unto the knowledge of the truth .
then again called they the man that was blind , and said unto him , give god the praise : we know that this man is a sinner .
he answered and said , whether he be a sinner or no , i know not : one thing i know , that , whereas i was blind , now i see .
these words spake his parents , because they feared the jews : for the jews had agreed already , that if any man did confess that he was christ , he should be put out of the synagogue .
and rehoboam went to shechem : for all israel were come to shechem to make him king .
therefore said his parents , he is of age ; ask him .
his parents answered them and said , we know that this is our son , and that he was born blind :
for all the firstborn of the children of israel are mine , both man and beast : on the day that i smote every firstborn in the land of egypt i sanctified them for myself .
but by what means he now seeth , we know not ; or who hath opened his eyes , we know not : he is of age ; ask him : he shall speak for himself .
and i have taken the levites for all the firstborn of the children of israel .
our inheritance is turned to strangers , our houses to aliens .
remember , o lord , what is come upon us : consider , and behold our reproach .
we have given the hand to the egyptians , and to the assyrians , to be satisfied with bread .
our necks are under persecution : we labour , and have no rest .
we have drunken our water for money ; our wood is sold unto us .
we are orphans and fatherless , our mothers are as widows .
we gat our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword of the wilderness .
servants have ruled over us : there is none that doth deliver us out of their hand .
and he said unto his brethren , my money is restored ; and , lo , it is even in my sack : and their heart failed them , and they were afraid , saying one to another , what is this that god hath done unto us ?
and they came unto jacob their father unto the land of canaan , and told him all that befell unto them ; saying ,
and he turned himself about from them , and wept ; and returned to them again , and communed with them , and took from them simeon , and bound him before their eyes .
then joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn , and to restore every man ' s money into his sack , and to give them provision for the way : and thus did he unto them .
and they laded their asses with the corn , and departed thence .
and as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn , he espied his money ; for , behold , it was in his sack ' s mouth .
and they said one to another , we are verily guilty concerning our brother , in that we saw the anguish of his soul , when he besought us , and we would not hear ; therefore is this distress come upon us .
and reuben answered them , saying , spake i not unto you , saying , do not sin against the child ; and ye would not hear ? therefore , behold , also his blood is required .
and they knew not that joseph understood them ; for he spake unto them by an interpreter .
if ye be true men , let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison : go ye , carry corn for the famine of your houses :
the righteous shall be glad in the lord , and shall trust in him ; and all the upright in heart shall glory .
and he put them all together into ward three days .
and joseph said unto them the third day , this do , and live ; for i fear god :
hereby ye shall be proved : by the life of pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence , except your youngest brother come hither .
send one of you , and let him fetch your brother , and ye shall be kept in prison , that your words may be proved , whether there be any truth in you : or else by the life of pharaoh surely ye are spies .
and they said , thy servants are twelve brethren , the sons of one man in the land of canaan ; and , behold , the youngest is this day with our father , and one is not .
and joseph said unto them , that is it that i spake unto you , saying , ye are spies :
we are all one man ' s sons ; we are true men , thy servants are no spies .
and he said unto them , nay , but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come .
and they said unto him , nay , my lord , but to buy food are thy servants come .
the revelation of jesus christ , which god gave unto him , to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass ; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant john :
blessed is he that readeth , and they that hear the words of this prophecy , and keep those things which are written therein : for the time is at hand .
who bare record of the word of god , and of the testimony of jesus christ , and of all things that he saw .
and salmon begat boaz , and boaz begat obed ,
and obed begat jesse , and jesse begat david .
and amminadab begat nahshon , and nahshon begat salmon ,
and naomi took the child , and laid it in her bosom , and became nurse unto it .
and the women her neighbours gave it a name , saying , there is a son born to naomi ; and they called his name obed : he is the father of jesse , the father of david .
i am alpha and omega , the beginning and the ending , saith the lord , which is , and which was , and which is to come , the almighty .
now these are the generations of pharez : pharez begat hezron ,
i john , who also am your brother , and companion in tribulation , and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ , was in the isle that is called patmos , for the word of god , and for the testimony of jesus christ .
and hezron begat ram , and ram begat amminadab ,
john to the seven churches which are in asia : grace be unto you , and peace , from him which is , and which was , and which is to come ; and from the seven spirits which are before his throne ;
and from jesus christ , who is the faithful witness , and the first begotten of the dead , and the prince of the kings of the earth . unto him that loved us , and washed us from our sins in his own blood ,
moreover ruth the moabitess , the wife of mahlon , have i purchased to be my wife , to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance , that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren , and from the gate of his place : ye are witnesses this day .
and all the people that were in the gate , and the elders , said , we are witnesses . the lord make the woman that is come into thine house like rachel and like leah , which two did build the house of israel : and do thou worthily in ephratah , and be famous in bethlehem :
and let thy house be like the house of pharez , whom tamar bare unto judah , of the seed which the lord shall give thee of this young woman .
so boaz took ruth , and she was his wife : and when he went in unto her , the lord gave her conception , and she bare a son .
and the women said unto naomi , blessed be the lord , which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman , that his name may be famous in israel .
and he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life , and a nourisher of thine old age : for thy daughter in law , which loveth thee , which is better to thee than seven sons , hath born him .
go ye up unto this feast : i go not up yet unto this feast ; for my time is not yet full come .
when he had said these words unto them , he abode still in galilee .
then jesus said unto them , my time is not yet come : but your time is alway ready .
the world cannot hate you ; but me it hateth , because i testify of it , that the works thereof are evil .
wherefore i will yet plead with you , saith the lord , and with your children ' s children will i plead .
the priests said not , where is the lord ? and they that handle the law knew me not : the pastors also transgressed against me , and the prophets prophesied by baal , and walked after things that do not profit .
and i brought you into a plentiful country , to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof ; but when ye entered , ye defiled my land , and made mine heritage an abomination .
after these things jesus walked in galilee : for he would not walk in jewry , because the jews sought to kill him .
thus saith the lord , what iniquity have your fathers found in me , that they are gone far from me , and have walked after vanity , and are become vain ?
hear ye the word of the lord , o house of jacob , and all the families of the house of israel :
israel was holiness unto the lord , and the firstfruits of his increase : all that devour him shall offend ; evil shall come upon them , saith the lord .
for there is no man that doeth any thing in secret , and he himself seeketh to be known openly . if thou do these things , shew thyself to the world .
go and cry in the ears of jerusalem , saying , thus saith the lord ; i remember thee , the kindness of thy youth , the love of thine espousals , when thou wentest after me in the wilderness , in a land that was not sown .
for neither did his brethren believe in him .
moreover the word of the lord came to me , saying ,
his brethren therefore said unto him , depart hence , and go into judaea , that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest .
and he came to the second , and said likewise . and he answered and said , i go , sir : and went not .
whether of them twain did the will of his father ? they say unto him , the first . jesus saith unto them , verily i say unto you , that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of god before you .
for john came unto you in the way of righteousness , and ye believed him not : but the publicans and the harlots believed him : and ye , when ye had seen it , repented not afterward , that ye might believe him .
hear another parable : there was a certain householder , which planted a vineyard , and hedged it round about , and digged a winepress in it , and built a tower , and let it out to husbandmen , and went into a far country :
and when the time of the fruit drew near , he sent his servants to the husbandmen , that they might receive the fruits of it .
and the husbandmen took his servants , and beat one , and killed another , and stoned another .
again , he sent other servants more than the first : and they did unto them likewise .
but last of all he sent unto them his son , saying , they will reverence my son .
and they caught him , and cast him out of the vineyard , and slew him .
and it came to pass at midnight , that the man was afraid , and turned himself : and , behold , a woman lay at his feet .
and he said , who art thou ? and she answered , i am ruth thine handmaid : spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid ; for thou art a near kinsman .
and she went down unto the floor , and did according to all that her mother in law bade her .
and when boaz had eaten and drunk , and his heart was merry , he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn : and she came softly , and uncovered his feet , and laid her down .
and it shall be , when he lieth down , that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie , and thou shalt go in , and uncover his feet , and lay thee down ; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do .
and she said unto her , all that thou sayest unto me i will do .
and when the disciples saw it , they marvelled , saying , how soon is the fig tree withered away !
and when he was come into the temple , the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching , and said , by what authority doest thou these things ? and who gave thee this authority ?
and jesus answered and said unto them , i also will ask you one thing , which if ye tell me , i in like wise will tell you by what authority i do these things .
and all things , whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer , believing , ye shall receive .
wash thyself therefore , and anoint thee , and put thy raiment upon thee , and get thee down to the floor : but make not thyself known unto the man , until he shall have done eating and drinking .
and now is not boaz of our kindred , with whose maidens thou wast ? behold , he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor .
but what think ye ? a certain man had two sons ; and he came to the first , and said , son , go work to day in my vineyard .
then naomi her mother in law said unto her , my daughter , shall i not seek rest for thee , that it may be well with thee ?
the baptism of john , whence was it ? from heaven , or of men ? and they reasoned with themselves , saying , if we shall say , from heaven ; he will say unto us , why did ye not then believe him ?
but if we shall say , of men ; we fear the people ; for all hold john as a prophet .
he answered and said , i will not : but afterward he repented , and went .
this is the dream ; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king .
thou , o king , art a king of kings : for the god of heaven hath given thee a kingdom , power , and strength , and glory .
and wheresoever the children of men dwell , the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand , and hath made thee ruler over them all . thou art this head of gold .
and after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee , and another third kingdom of brass , which shall bear rule over all the earth .
this image ' s head was of fine gold , his breast and his arms of silver , his belly and his thighs of brass ,
his legs of iron , his feet part of iron and part of clay .
thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands , which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay , and brake them to pieces .
but as for me , this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that i have more than any living , but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king , and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart .
thou , o king , sawest , and behold a great image . this great image , whose brightness was excellent , stood before thee ; and the form thereof was terrible .
when thou goest out to battle against thine enemies , and seest horses , and chariots , and a people more than thou , be not afraid of them : for the lord thy god is with thee , which brought thee up out of the land of egypt .
beware of the scribes , which desire to walk in long robes , and love greetings in the markets , and the highest seats in the synagogues , and the chief rooms at feasts ;
they have not known nor understood : for he hath shut their eyes , that they cannot see ; and their hearts , that they cannot understand .
then daniel requested of the king , and he set shadrach , meshach , and abed - nego , over the affairs of the province of babylon : but daniel sat in the gate of the king .
david therefore calleth him lord , how is he then his son ?
he burneth part thereof in the fire ; with part thereof he eateth flesh ; he roasteth roast , and is satisfied : yea , he warmeth himself , and saith , aha , i am warm , i have seen the fire :
the king answered unto daniel , and said , of a truth it is , that your god is a god of gods , and a lord of kings , and a revealer of secrets , seeing thou couldest reveal this secret .
then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples ,
and the residue thereof he maketh a god , even his graven image : he falleth down unto it , and worshippeth it , and prayeth unto it , and saith , deliver me ; for thou art my god .
then the king made daniel a great man , and gave him many great gifts , and made him ruler over the whole province of babylon , and chief of the governors over all the wise men of babylon .
and david himself saith in the book of psalms , the lord said unto my lord , sit thou on my right hand ,
and it shall be , when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people , that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people .
till i make thine enemies thy footstool .
and the officers shall speak further unto the people , and they shall say , what man is there that is fearful and fainthearted ? let him go and return unto his house , lest his brethren ' s heart faint as well as his heart .
then the king nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face , and worshipped daniel , and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him .
and after that they durst not ask him any question at all .
and what man is there that hath betrothed a wife , and hath not taken her ? let him go and return unto his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man take her .
and whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay , they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men : but they shall not cleave one to another , even as iron is not mixed with clay .
and he said unto them , how say they that christ is david ' s son ?
and what man is he that hath planted a vineyard , and hath not yet eaten of it ? let him also go and return unto his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man eat of it .
and in the days of these kings shall the god of heaven set up a kingdom , which shall never be destroyed : and the kingdom shall not be left to other people , but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms , and it shall stand for ever .
and the officers shall speak unto the people , saying , what man is there that hath built a new house , and hath not dedicated it ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man dedicate it .
and whereas thou sawest the feet and toes , part of potters ' clay , and part of iron , the kingdom shall be divided ; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron , forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay .
for the lord your god is he that goeth with you , to fight for you agginst your enemies , to save you .
and as the toes of the feet were part of iron , and part of clay , so the kingdom shall be partly strong , and partly broken .
and shall say unto them , hear , o israel , ye approach this day unto battle against your enemies : let not your hearts faint , fear not , and do not tremble , neither be ye terrified because of them ;
and it shall be , when ye are come nigh unto the battle , that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people ,
and the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron : forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things : and as iron that breaketh all these , shall it break in pieces and bruise .
and when the chief priests and pharisees had heard his parables , they perceived that he spake of them .
and the lord said unto moses , yet will i bring one plague more upon pharaoh , and upon egypt ; afterwards he will let you go hence : when he shall let you go , he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether .
but when they sought to lay hands on him , they feared the multitude , because they took him for a prophet .
speak now in the ears of the people , and let every man borrow of his neighbour , and every woman of her neighbour , jewels of silver , and jewels of gold .
therefore say i unto you , the kingdom of god shall be taken from you , and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof .
and whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken : but on whomsoever it shall fall , it will grind him to powder .
and moses said , thus saith the lord , about midnight will i go out into the midst of egypt :
they say unto him , he will miserably destroy those wicked men , and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen , which shall render him the fruits in their seasons .
and all the firstborn in the land of egypt shall die , from the firstborn of pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne , even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill ; and all the firstborn of beasts .
jesus saith unto them , did ye never read in the scriptures , the stone which the builders rejected , the same is become the head of the corner : this is the lord ' s doing , and it is marvellous in our eyes ?
and there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of egypt , such as there was none like it , nor shall be like it any more .
when the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh , what will he do unto those husbandmen ?
and all these thy servants shall come down unto me , and bow down themselves unto me , saying , get thee out , and all the people that follow thee : and after that i will go out . and he went out from pharaoh in a great anger .
then shall it be for a man to burn : for he will take thereof , and warm himself ; yea , he kindleth it , and baketh bread ; yea , he maketh a god , and worshippeth it ; he maketh it a graven image , and falleth down thereto .
and the lord said unto moses , pharaoh shall not hearken unto you ; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of egypt .
he heweth him down cedars , and taketh the cypress and the oak , which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest : he planteth an ash , and the rain doth nourish it .
the carpenter stretcheth out his rule ; he marketh it out with a line ; he fitteth it with planes , and he marketh it out with the compass , and maketh it after the figure of a man , according to the beauty of a man ; that it may remain in the house .
the smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals , and fashioneth it with hammers , and worketh it with the strength of his arms : yea , he is hungry , and his strength faileth : he drinketh no water , and is faint .
behold , all his fellows shall be ashamed : and the workmen , they are of men : let them all be gathered together , let them stand up ; yet they shall fear , and they shall be ashamed together .
who hath formed a god , or molten a graven image that is profitable for nothing ?
and the second took her to wife , and he died childless .
last of all the woman died also .
and the third took her ; and in like manner the seven also : and they left no children , and died .
and jesus answering said unto them , the children of this world marry , and are given in marriage :
that saith of cyrus , he is my shepherd , and shall perform all my pleasure : even saying to jerusalem , thou shalt be built ; and to the temple , thy foundation shall be laid .
therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she ? for seven had her to wife .
that saith to the deep , be dry , and i will dry up thy rivers :
neither can they die any more : for they are equal unto the angels ; and are the children of god , being the children of the resurrection .
but they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world , and the resurrection from the dead , neither marry , nor are given in marriage :
for he is not a god of the dead , but of the living : for all live unto him .
now that the dead are raised , even moses shewed at the bush , when he calleth the lord the god of abraham , and the god of isaac , and the god of jacob .
then certain of the scribes answering said , master , thou hast well said .
he feedeth on ashes : a deceived heart hath turned him aside , that he cannot deliver his soul , nor say , is there not a lie in my right hand ?
remember these , o jacob and israel ; for thou art my servant : i have formed thee ; thou art my servant : o israel , thou shalt not be forgotten of me .
i have blotted out , as a thick cloud , thy transgressions , and , as a cloud , thy sins : return unto me ; for i have redeemed thee .
for he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden : for , behold , from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed .
sing , o ye heavens ; for the lord hath done it : shout , ye lower parts of the earth : break forth into singing , ye mountains , o forest , and every tree therein : for the lord hath redeemed jacob , and glorified himself in israel .
and my spirit hath rejoiced in god my saviour .
thus saith the lord , thy redeemer , and he that formed thee from the womb , i am the lord that maketh all things ; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone ; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself ;
that frustrateth the tokens of the liars , and maketh diviners mad ; that turneth wise men backward , and maketh their knowledge foolish ;
that confirmeth the word of his servant , and performeth the counsel of his messengers ; that saith to jerusalem , thou shalt be inhabited ; and to the cities of judah , ye shall be built , and i will raise up the decayed places thereof :
for , lo , as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears , the babe leaped in my womb for joy .
and mary said , my soul doth magnify the lord ,
and blessed is she that believed : for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the lord .
and entered into the house of zacharias , and saluted elisabeth .
and she spake out with a loud voice , and said , blessed art thou among women , and blessed is the fruit of thy womb .
and it came to pass , that , when elisabeth heard the salutation of mary , the babe leaped in her womb ; and elisabeth was filled with the holy ghost :
the man , who is the lord of the land , spake roughly to us , and took us for spies of the country .
and they asked him , saying , master , we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly , neither acceptest thou the person of any , but teachest the way of god truly :
we be twelve brethren , sons of our father ; one is not , and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of canaan .
and they watched him , and sent forth spies , which should feign themselves just men , that they might take hold of his words , that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor .
and we said unto him , we are true men ; we are no spies :
and bring your youngest brother unto me : then shall i know that ye are no spies , but that ye are true men : so will i deliver you your brother , and ye shall traffick in the land .
again in the ninth year , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , the word of the lord came unto me , saying ,
and the man , the lord of the country , said unto us , hereby shall i know that ye are true men ; leave one of your brethren here with me , and take food for the famine of your households , and be gone :
and he said unto them , render therefore unto caesar the things which be caesar ' s , and unto god the things which be god ' s .
and jacob their father said unto them , me have ye bereaved of my children : joseph is not , and simeon is not , and ye will take benjamin away : all these things are against me .
shew me a penny . whose image and superscription hath it ? they answered and said , caesar ' s .
and it came to pass as they emptied their sacks , that , behold , every man ' s bundle of money was in his sack : and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money , they were afraid .
but he perceived their craftiness , and said unto them , why tempt ye me ?
is it lawful for us to give tribute unto caesar , or no ?
there were therefore seven brethren : and the first took a wife , and died without children .
saying , master , moses wrote unto us , if any man ' s brother die , having a wife , and he die without children , that his brother should take his wife , and raise up seed unto his brother .
then came to him certain of the sadducees , which deny that there is any resurrection ; and they asked him ,
and they could not take hold of his words before the people : and they marvelled at his answer , and held their peace .
and the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him ; and they feared the people : for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them .
and mary said , behold the handmaid of the lord ; be it unto me according to thy word . and the angel departed from her .
for with god nothing shall be impossible .
and , behold , thy cousin elisabeth , she hath also conceived a son in her old age : and this is the sixth month with her , who was called barren .
and the angel answered and said unto her , the holy ghost shall come upon thee , and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee : therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god .
son of man , write thee the name of the day , even of this same day : the king of babylon set himself against jerusalem this same day .
then said mary unto the angel , how shall this be , seeing i know not a man ?
and utter a parable unto the rebellious house , and say unto them , thus saith the lord god ; set on a pot , set it on , and also pour water into it :
and he shall reign over the house of jacob for ever ; and of his kingdom there shall be no end .
gather the pieces thereof into it , even every good piece , the thigh , and the shoulder ; fill it with the choice bones .
take the choice of the flock , and burn also the bones under it , and make it boil well , and let them seethe the bones of it therein .
and , behold , thou shalt conceive in thy womb , and bring forth a son , and shalt call his name jesus .
and the angel said unto her , fear not , mary : for thou hast found favour with god .
for her blood is in the midst of her ; she set it upon the top of a rock ; she poured it not upon the ground , to cover it with dust ;
that it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance ; i have set her blood upon the top of a rock , that it should not be covered .
therefore thus saith the lord god ; woe to the bloody city ! i will even make the pile for fire great .
and abraham said , my son , god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering : so they went both of them together .
and they came to the place which god had told him of ; and abraham built an altar there , and laid the wood in order , and bound isaac his son , and laid him on the altar upon the wood .
woe to the rebellious children , saith the lord , that take counsel , but not of me ; and that cover with a covering , but not of my spirit , that they may add sin to sin :
and at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen , that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard : but the husbandmen beat him , and sent him away empty .
then on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes , and saw the place afar off .
for his princes were at zoan , and his ambassadors came to hanes .
and abraham said unto his young men , abide ye here with the ass ; and i and the lad will go yonder and worship , and come again to you ,
they were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them , nor be an help nor profit , but a shame , and also a reproach .
and abraham took the wood of the burnt offering , and laid it upon isaac his son ; and he took the fire in his hand , and a knife ; and they went both of them together .
that walk to go down into egypt , and have not asked at my mouth ; to strengthen themselves in the strength of pharaoh , and to trust in the shadow of egypt !
and isaac spake unto abraham his father , and said , my father : and he said , here am i , my son . and he said , behold the fire and the wood : but where is the lamb for a burnt offering ?
therefore shall the strength of pharaoh be your shame , and the trust in the shadow of egypt your confusion .
he shall come and destroy these husbandmen , and shall give the vineyard to others . and when they heard it , they said , god forbid .
now go , write it before them in a table , and note it in a book , that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever :
so they cast him out of the vineyard , and killed him . what therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them ?
that this is a rebellious people , lying children , children that will not hear the law of the lord :
and he beheld them , and said , what is this then that is written , the stone which the builders rejected , the same is become the head of the corner ?
for the egyptians shall help in vain , and to no purpose : therefore have i cried concerning this , their strength is to sit still .
and again he sent a third : and they wounded him also , and cast him out .
and again he sent another servant : and they beat him also , and entreated him shamefully , and sent him away empty .
but when the husbandmen saw him , they reasoned among themselves , saying , this is the heir : come , let us kill him , that the inheritance may be ours .
and in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god unto a city of galilee , named nazareth ,
and when he saw a fig tree in the way , he came to it , and found nothing thereon , but leaves only , and said unto it , let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever . and presently the fig tree withered away .
thus hath the lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me , to take away my reproach among men .
now in the morning as he returned into the city , he hungered .
and the angel came in unto her , and said , hail , thou that art highly favoured , the lord is with thee : blessed art thou among women .
to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was joseph , of the house of david ; and the virgin ' s name was mary .
and when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did , and the children crying in the temple , and saying , hosanna to the son of david ; they were sore displeased ,
and when she saw him , she was troubled at his saying , and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be .
and the blind and the lame came to him in the temple ; and he healed them .
but we see jesus , who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death , crowned with glory and honour ; that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man .
and he left them , and went out of the city into bethany ; and he lodged there .
and said unto him , hearest thou what these say ? and jesus saith unto them , yea ; have ye never read , out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise ?
thou madest him a little lower than the angels ; thou crownedst him with glory and honour , and didst set him over the works of thy hands :
and it came to pass after these things , that god did tempt abraham , and said unto him , abraham : and he said , behold , here i am .
and the multitude said , this is jesus the prophet of nazareth of galilee .
thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet . for in that he put all in subjection under him , he left nothing that is not put under him . but now we see not yet all things put under him .
and when he was come into jerusalem , all the city was moved , saying , who is this ?
and , behold , thou shalt be dumb , and not able to speak , until the day that these things shall be performed , because thou believest not my words , which shall be fulfilled in their season .
and abraham rose up early in the morning , and saddled his ass , and took two of his young men with him , and isaac his son , and clave the wood for the burnt offering , and rose up , and went unto the place of which god had told him .
and said unto them , it is written , my house shall be called the house of prayer ; but ye have made it a den of thieves .
but one in a certain place testified , saying , what is man , that thou art mindful of him ? or the son of man , that thou visitest him ?
and he said , take now thy son , thine only son isaac , whom thou lovest , and get thee into the land of moriah ; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which i will tell thee of .
and jesus went into the temple of god , and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple , and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers , and the seats of them that sold doves ,
how shall we escape , if we neglect so great salvation ; which at the first began to be spoken by the lord , and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him ;
god also bearing them witness , both with signs and wonders , and with divers miracles , and gifts of the holy ghost , according to his own will ?
and the people waited for zacharias , and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple .
therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard , lest at any time we should let them slip .
and after those days his wife elisabeth conceived , and hid herself five months , saying ,
for if the word spoken by angels was stedfast , and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward ;
and it came to pass , that , as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished , he departed to his own house .
and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of elias , to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children , and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just ; to make ready a people prepared for the lord .
for he shall be great in the sight of the lord , and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink ; and he shall be filled with the holy ghost , even from his mother ' s womb .
and thou shalt have joy and gladness ; and many shall rejoice at his birth .
and zacharias said unto the angel , whereby shall i know this ? for i am an old man , and my wife well stricken in years .
but the angel said unto him , fear not , zacharias : for thy prayer is heard ; and thy wife elisabeth shall bear thee a son , and thou shalt call his name john .
and when zacharias saw him , he was troubled , and fear fell upon him .
and there appeared unto him an angel of the lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense .
and the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense .
shall i cause it to return into his sheath ? i will judge thee in the place where thou wast created , in the land of thy nativity .
and i will pour out mine indignation upon thee , i will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath , and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men , and skilful to destroy .
thou shalt be for fuel to the fire ; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land ; thou shalt be no more remembered : for i the lord have spoken it .
remember that jesus christ of the seed of david was raised from the dead according to my gospel :
consider what i say ; and the lord give thee understanding in all things .
wherein i suffer trouble , as an evil doer , even unto bonds ; but the word of god is not bound .
and the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses , the same commit thou to faithful men , who shall be able to teach others also .
thou therefore , my son , be strong in the grace that is in christ jesus .
no man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life ; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier .
give me now wisdom and knowledge , that i may go out and come in before this people : for who can judge this thy people , that is so great ?
thou therefore endure hardness , as a good soldier of jesus christ .
and if a man also strive for masteries , yet is he not crowned , except he strive lawfully .
for he that is entered into his rest , he also hath ceased from his own works , as god did from his .
and sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old : these were the years of the life of sarah .
and thou , profane wicked prince of israel , whose day is come , when iniquity shall have an end ,
and sarah died in kirjath - arba ; the same is hebron in the land of canaan : and abraham came to mourn for sarah , and to weep for her .
thus saith the lord god ; remove the diadem , and take off the crown : this shall not be the same : exalt him that is low , and abase him that is high .
i will overturn , overturn , overturn , it : and it shall be no more , until he come whose right it is ; and i will give it him .
whiles they see vanity unto thee , whiles they divine a lie unto thee , to bring thee upon the necks of them that are slain , of the wicked , whose day is come , when their iniquity shall have an end .
appoint a way , that the sword may come to rabbath of the ammonites , and to judah in jerusalem the defenced .
for the king of babylon stood at the parting of the way , at the head of the two ways , to use divination : he made his arrows bright , he consulted with images , he looked in the liver .
at his right hand was the divination for jerusalem , to appoint captains , to open the mouth in the slaughter , to lift up the voice with shouting , to appoint battering rams against the gates , to cast a mount , and to build a fort .
and it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight , to them that have sworn oaths : but he will call to remembrance the iniquity , that they may be taken .
therefore thus saith the lord god ; because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered , in that your transgressions are discovered , so that in all your doings your sins do appear ; because , i say , that ye are come to remembrance , ye shall be taken with the hand .
turn ye unto him from whom the children of israel have deeply revolted .
as birds flying , so will the lord of hosts defend jerusalem ; defending also he will deliver it ; and passing over he will preserve it .
then shall the assyrian fall with the sword , not of a mighty man ; and the sword , not of a mean man , shall devour him : but he shall flee from the sword , and his young men shall be discomfited .
for in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver , and his idols of gold , which your own hands have made unto you for a sin .
and he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear , and his princes shall be afraid of the ensign , saith the lord , whose fire is in zion , and his furnace in jerusalem .
and they answered the angel of the lord that stood among the myrtle trees , and said , we have walked to and fro through the earth , and , behold , all the earth sitteth still , and is at rest .
that he may give me the cave of machpelah , which he hath , which is in the end of his field ; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you .
and the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said , these are they whom the lord hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth .
and he communed with them , saying , if it be your mind that i should bury my dead out of my sight ; hear me , and intreat for me to ephron the son of zohar ,
let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace , that we may obtain mercy , and find grace to help in time of need .
and abraham stood up , and bowed himself to the people of the land , even to the children of heth .
for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities ; but was in all points tempted like as we are , yet without sin .
hear us , my lord : thou art a mighty prince among us : in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead ; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre , but that thou mayest bury thy dead .
yet he also is wise , and will bring evil , and will not call back his words : but will arise against the house of the evildoers , and against the help of them that work iniquity .
seeing then that we have a great high priest , that is passed into the heavens , jesus the son of god , let us hold fast our profession .
and the children of heth answered abraham , saying unto him ,
woe to them that go down to egypt for help ; and stay on horses , and trust in chariots , because they are many ; and in horsemen , because they are very strong ; but they look not unto the holy one of israel , neither seek the lord !
i am a stranger and a sojourner with you : give me a possession of a buryingplace with you , that i may bury my dead out of my sight .
for the word of god is quick , and powerful , and sharper than any twoedged sword , piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit , and of the joints and marrow , and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart .
and abraham stood up from before his dead , and spake unto the sons of heth , saying ,
now the egyptians are men , and not god ; and their horses flesh , and not spirit . when the lord shall stretch out his hand , both he that helpeth shall fall , and he that is holpen shall fall down , and they all shall fail together .
then the angel of the lord answered and said , o lord of hosts , how long wilt thou not have mercy on jerusalem and on the cities of judah , against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years ?
and the lord answered the angel that talked with me with good words and comfortable words .
so the angel that communed with me said unto me , cry thou , saying , thus saith the lord of hosts ; i am jealous for jerusalem and for zion with a great jealousy .
therefore thus saith the lord ; i am returned to jerusalem with mercies : my house shall be built in it , saith the lord of hosts , and a line shall be stretched forth upon jerusalem .
cry yet , saying , thus saith the lord of hosts ; my cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad ; and the lord shall yet comfort zion , and shall yet choose jerusalem .
then lifted i up mine eyes , and saw , and behold four horns .
and it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first , that he went through the corn fields ; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn , and did eat , rubbing them in their hands .
and jesus answering them said , have ye not read so much as this , what david did , when himself was an hungred , and they which were with him ;
and certain of the pharisees said unto them , why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days ?
and he said unto them , that the son of man is lord also of the sabbath .
how he went into the house of god , and did take and eat the shewbread , and gave also to them that were with him ; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone ?
and the scribes and pharisees watched him , whether he would heal on the sabbath day ; that they might find an accusation against him .
and it came to pass also on another sabbath , that he entered into the synagogue and taught : and there was a man whose right hand was withered .
then said jesus unto them , i will ask you one thing ; is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good , or to do evil ? to save life , or to destroy it ?
but he knew their thoughts , and said to the man which had the withered hand , rise up , and stand forth in the midst . and he arose and stood forth .
and the lord shewed me four carpenters .
and next unto them repaired melatiah the gibeonite , and jadon the meronothite , the men of gibeon , and of mizpah , unto the throne of the governor on this side the river .
moreover the old gate repaired jehoiada the son of paseah , and meshullam the son of besodeiah ; they laid the beams thereof , and set up the doors thereof , and the locks thereof , and the bars thereof .
and next unto them the tekoites repaired ; but their nobles put not their necks to the work of their lord .
next unto him repaired uzziel the son of harhaiah , of the goldsmiths . next unto him also repaired hananiah the son of one of the apothecaries , and they fortified jerusalem unto the broad wall .
and the city lieth foursquare , and the length is as large as the breadth : and he measured the city with the reed , twelve thousand furlongs . the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal .
and he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city , and the gates thereof , and the wall thereof .
and the building of the wall of it was of jasper : and the city was pure gold , like unto clear glass .
and he measured the wall thereof , an hundred and forty and four cubits , according to the measure of a man , that is , of the angel .
and had a wall great and high , and had twelve gates , and at the gates twelve angels , and names written thereon , which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of israel :
and next unto him builded the men of jericho . and next to them builded zaccur the son of imri .
having the glory of god : and her light was like unto a stone most precious , even like a jasper stone , clear as crystal ;
but the fish gate did the sons of hassenaah build , who also laid the beams thereof , and set up the doors thereof , the locks thereof , and the bars thereof .
and the wall of the city had twelve foundations , and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the lamb .
on the east three gates ; on the north three gates ; on the south three gates ; and on the west three gates .
then eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests , and they builded the sheep gate ; they sanctified it , and set up the doors of it ; even unto the tower of meah they sanctified it , unto the tower of hananeel .
and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain , and shewed me that great city , the holy jerusalem , descending out of heaven from god ,
and the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones . the first foundation was jasper ; the second , sapphire ; the third , a chalcedony ; the fourth , an emerald ;
and all the congregation of judah , with the priests and the levites , and all the congregation that came out of israel , and the strangers that came out of the land of israel , and that dwelt in judah , rejoiced .
for hezekiah king of judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep ; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep : and a great number of priests sanctified themselves .
then the priests the levites arose and blessed the people : and their voice was heard , and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling place , even unto heaven .
how is the faithful city become an harlot ! it was full of judgment ; righteousness lodged in it ; but now murderers .
so there was great joy in jerusalem : for since the time of solomon the son of david king of israel there was not the like in jerusalem .
but if ye refuse and rebel , ye shall be devoured with the sword : for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it .
i will take no bullock out of thy house , nor he goats out of thy folds .
hear , o my people , and i will speak ; o israel , and i will testify against thee : i am god , even thy god .
i will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings , to have been continually before me .
and when ye spread forth your hands , i will hide mine eyes from you : yea , when ye make many prayers , i will not hear : your hands are full of blood .
he revealeth the deep and secret things : he knoweth what is in the darkness , and the light dwelleth with him .
wash you , make you clean ; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes ; cease to do evil ;
and he changeth the times and the seasons : he removeth kings , and setteth up kings : he giveth wisdom unto the wise , and knowledge to them that know understanding :
learn to do well ; seek judgment , relieve the oppressed , judge the fatherless , plead for the widow .
therefore daniel went in unto arioch , whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of babylon : he went and said thus unto him ; destroy not the wise men of babylon : bring me in before the king , and i will shew unto the king the interpretation .
come now , and let us reason together , saith the lord : though your sins be as scarlet , they shall be as white as snow ; though they be red like crimson , they shall be as wool .
i thank thee , and praise thee , o thou god of my fathers , who hast given me wisdom and might , and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee : for thou hast now made known unto us the king ' s matter .
the fifth , sardonyx ; the sixth , sardius ; the seventh , chrysolite ; the eighth , beryl ; the ninth , a topaz ; the tenth , a chrysoprasus ; the eleventh , a jacinth ; the twelfth , an amethyst .
and the lord hearkened to hezekiah , and healed the people .
to what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me ? saith the lord : i am full of the burnt offerings of rams , and the fat of fed beasts ; and i delight not in the blood of bullocks , or of lambs , or of he goats .
and the twelve gates were twelve pearls ; every several gate was of one pearl : and the street of the city was pure gold , as it were transparent glass .
and the children of israel that were present at jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness : and the levites and the priests praised the lord day by day , singing with loud instruments unto the lord .
when ye come to appear before me , who hath required this at your hand , to tread my courts ?
and hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the levites that taught the good knowledge of the lord : and they did eat throughout the feast seven days , offering peace offerings , and making confession to the lord god of their fathers .
bring no more vain oblations ; incense is an abomination unto me ; the new moons and sabbaths , the calling of assemblies , i cannot away with ; it is iniquity , even the solemn meeting .
daniel answered and said , blessed be the name of god for ever and ever : for wisdom and might are his :
and the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days : and they kept other seven days with gladness .
your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth : they are a trouble unto me ; i am weary to bear them .
and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it : and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it .
and the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day : for there shall be no night there .
as for thee , o king , thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed , what should come to pass hereafter : and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass .
and i saw no temple therein : for the lord god almighty and the lamb are the temple of it .
and the city had no need of the sun , neither of the moon , to shine in it : for the glory of god did lighten it , and the lamb is the light thereof .
if ye be willing and obedient , ye shall eat the good of the land :
the king answered and said to daniel , whose name was belteshazzar , art thou able to make known unto me the dream which i have seen , and the interpretation thereof ?
then arioch brought in daniel before the king in haste and said thus unto him , i have found a man of the captives of judah , that will make known unto the king the interpretation .
and they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it .
but there is a god in heaven that revealeth secrets , and maketh known to the king nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days . thy dream , and the visions of thy head upon thy bed , are these ;
and there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth , neither whatsoever worketh abomination , or maketh a lie : but they which are written in the lamb ' s book of life .
daniel answered in the presence of the king , and said , the secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men , the astrologers , the magicians , the soothsayers , shew unto the king ;
for ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth , and as a garden that hath no water .
and the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together , and they that forsake the lord shall be consumed .
and the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain ; and they sought daniel and his fellows to be slain .
for they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired , and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen .
for this cause the king was angry and very furious , and commanded to destroy all the wise men of babylon .
and i will restore thy judges as at the first , and thy counsellers as at the beginning : afterward thou shalt be called , the city of righteousness , the faithful city .
and it is a rare thing that the king requireth , and there is none other that can shew it before the king , except the gods , whose dwelling is not with flesh .
zion shall be redeemed with judgment , and her converts with righteousness .
the chaldeans answered before the king , and said , there is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king ' s matter : therefore there is no king , lord , nor ruler , that asked such things at any magician , or astrologer , or chaldean .
therefore saith the lord , the lord of hosts , the mighty one of israel , ah , i will ease me of mine adversaries , and avenge me of mine enemies :
and i will turn my hand upon thee , and purely purge away thy dross , and take away all thy tin :
thy silver is become dross , thy wine mixed with water :
thy princes are rebellious , and companions of thieves : every one loveth gifts , and followeth after rewards : they judge not the fatherless , neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them .
then was the secret revealed unto daniel in a night vision . then daniel blessed the god of heaven .
that they would desire mercies of the god of heaven concerning this secret ; that daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of babylon .
then daniel went to his house , and made the thing known to hananiah , mishael , and azariah , his companions :
then daniel went in , and desired of the king that he would give him time , and that he would shew the king the interpretation .
he answered and said to arioch the king ' s captain , why is the decree so hasty from the king ? then arioch made the thing known to daniel .
then daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to arioch the captain of the king ' s guard , which was gone forth to slay the wise men of babylon :
because it is a trial , and what if the sword contemn even the rod ? it shall be no more , saith the lord god .
cry and howl , son of man : for it shall be upon my people , it shall be upon all the princes of israel : terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people : smite therefore upon thy thigh .
and he hath give it to be furbished , that it may be handled : this sword is sharpened , and it is furbished , to give it into the hand of the slayer .
it is sharpened to make a sore slaughter ; it is furbished that it may glitter : should we then make mirth ? it contemneth the rod of my son , as every tree .
also , thou son of man , appoint thee two ways , that the sword of the king of babylon may come : both twain shall come forth out of one land : and choose thou a place , choose it at the head of the way to the city .
the word of the lord came unto me again , saying ,
i will also smite mine hands together , and i will cause my fury to rest : i the lord have said it .
go thee one way or other , either on the right hand , or on the left , whithersoever thy face is set .
i have set the point of the sword against all their gates , that their heart may faint , and their ruins be multiplied : ah ! it is made bright , it is wrapped up for the slaughter .
thou therefore , son of man , prophesy , and smite thine hands together , and let the sword be doubled the third time , the sword of the slain : it is the sword of the great men that are slain , which entereth into their privy chambers .
and solomon had horses brought out of egypt , and linen yarn : the king ' s merchants received the linen yarn at a price .
that prepareth his heart to seek god , the lord god of his fathers , though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary .
and the king made silver and gold at jerusalem as plenteous as stones , and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the vale for abundance .
for a multitude of the people , even many of ephraim , and manasseh , issachar , and zebulun , had not cleansed themselves , yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written . but hezekiah prayed for them , saying , the good lord pardon every one
for there were many in the congregation that were not sanctified : therefore the levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one that was not clean , to sanctify them unto the lord .
and they fetched up , and brought forth out of egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver , and an horse for an hundred and fifty : and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the hittites , and for the kings of syria , by their means .
and they stood in their place after their manner , according to the law of moses the man of god : the priests sprinkled the blood , which they received of the hand of the levites .
wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee ; and i will give thee riches , and wealth , and honour , such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee , neither shall there any after thee have the like .
hear the word of the lord , ye rulers of sodom ; give ear unto the law of our god , ye people of gomorrah .
then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month : and the priests and the levites were ashamed , and sanctified themselves , and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the lord .
and they arose and took away the altars that were in jerusalem , and all the altars for incense took they away , and cast them into the brook kidron .
and solomon gathered chariots and horsemen : and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots , and twelve thousand horsemen , which he placed in the chariot cities , and with the king at jerusalem .
and there assembled at jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month , a very great congregation .
then solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at gibeon to jerusalem , from before the tabernacle of the congregation , and reigned over israel .
nevertheless divers of asher and manasseh and of zebulun humbled themselves , and came to jerusalem .
then the word of the lord came unto me , saying ,
also in judah the hand of god was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes , by the word of the lord .
before i formed thee in the belly i knew thee ; and before thou camest forth out of the womb i sanctified thee , and i ordained thee a prophet unto the nations .
then said i , ah , lord god ! behold , i cannot speak : for i am a child .
so the posts passed from city to city through the country of ephraim and manasseh even unto zebulun : but they laughed them to scorn , and mocked them .
but the lord said unto me , say not , i am a child : for thou shalt go to all that i shall send thee , and whatsoever i command thee thou shalt speak .
the words of jeremiah the son of hilkiah , of the priests that were in anathoth in the land of benjamin :
to whom the word of the lord came in the days of josiah the son of amon king of judah , in the thirteenth year of his reign .
it came also in the days of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah , unto the end of the eleventh year of zedekiah the son of josiah king of judah , unto the carrying away of jerusalem captive in the fifth month .
be not afraid of their faces : for i am with thee to deliver thee , saith the lord .
then the lord put forth his hand , and touched my mouth . and the lord said unto me , behold , i have put my words in thy mouth .
i will rise now , and go about the city in the streets , and in the broad ways i will seek him whom my soul loveth : i sought him , but i found him not .
by night on my bed i sought him whom my soul loveth : i sought him , but i found him not .
king solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of lebanon .
behold his bed , which is solomon ' s ; threescore valiant men are about it , of the valiant of israel .
they all hold swords , being expert in war : every man hath his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night .
i charge you , o ye daughters of jerusalem , by the roes , and by the hinds of the field , that ye stir not up , nor awake my love , till he please .
who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke , perfumed with myrrh and frankincense , with all powders of the merchant ?
the watchmen that go about the city found me : to whom i said , saw ye him whom my soul loveth ?
it was but a little that i passed from them , but i found him whom my soul loveth : i held him , and would not let him go , until i had brought him into my mother ' s house , and into the chamber of her that conceived me .
for thou hast delivered my soul from death : wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling , that i may walk before god in the light of the living ?
thy vows are upon me , o god : i will render praises unto thee .
in god have i put my trust : i will not be afraid what man can do unto me .
in god will i praise his word : in the lord will i praise his word .
and he said unto me , son of man , go , get thee unto the house of israel , and speak with my words unto them .
moreover he said unto me , son of man , eat that thou findest ; eat this roll , and go speak unto the house of israel .
so i opened my mouth , and he caused me to eat that roll .
so then , brethren , we are not children of the bondwoman , but of the free .
as an adamant harder than flint have i made thy forehead : fear them not , neither be dismayed at their looks , though they be a rebellious house .
behold , i have made thy face strong against their faces , and thy forehead strong against their foreheads .
but the house of israel will not hearken unto thee ; for they will not hearken unto me : for all the house of israel are impudent and hardhearted .
not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language , whose words thou canst not understand . surely , had i sent thee to them , they would have hearkened unto thee .
for thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language , but to the house of israel ;
and they that have believing masters , let them not despise them , because they are brethren ; but rather do them service , because they are faithful and beloved , partakers of the benefit . these things teach and exhort .
if any man teach otherwise , and consent not to wholesome words , even the words of our lord jesus christ , and to the doctrine which is according to godliness ;
let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour , that the name of god and his doctrine be not blasphemed .
unto the angel of the church of ephesus write ; these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand , who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks ;
nevertheless what saith the scripture ? cast out the bondwoman and her son : for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman .
i know thy works , and thy labour , and thy patience , and how thou canst not bear them which are evil : and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles , and are not , and hast found them liars :
the mighty god , even the lord , hath spoken , and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof .
out of zion , the perfection of beauty , god hath shined .
and having food and raiment let us be therewith content .
but they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare , and into many foolish and hurtful lusts , which drown men in destruction and perdition .
but godliness with contentment is great gain .
gather my saints together unto me ; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice .
for we brought nothing into this world , and it is certain we can carry nothing out .
and the heavens shall declare his righteousness : for god is judge himself . selah .
he is proud , knowing nothing , but doting about questions and strifes of words , whereof cometh envy , strife , railings , evil surmisings ,
our god shall come , and shall not keep silence : a fire shall devour before him , and it shall be very tempestuous round about him .
perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds , and destitute of the truth , supposing that gain is godliness : from such withdraw thyself .
he shall call to the heavens from above , and to the earth , that he may judge his people .
now we , brethren , as isaac was , are the children of promise .
but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit , even so it is now .
for then will i turn to the people a pure language , that they may all call upon the name of the lord , to serve him with one consent .
for it is written , that abraham had two sons , the one by a bondmaid , the other by a freewoman .
she obeyed not the voice ; she received not correction ; she trusted not in the lord ; she drew not near to her god .
but he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh ; but he of the freewoman was by promise .
her princes within her are roaring lions ; her judges are evening wolves ; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow .
i desire to be present with you now , and to change my voice ; for i stand in doubt of you .
tell me , ye that desire to be under the law , do ye not hear the law ?
woe to her that is filthy and polluted , to the oppressing city !
but jerusalem which is above is free , which is the mother of us all .
i have cut off the nations : their towers are desolate ; i made their streets waste , that none passeth by : their cities are destroyed , so that there is no man , that there is none inhabitant .
for it is written , rejoice , thou barren that bearest not ; break forth and cry , thou that travailest not : for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband .
i said , surely thou wilt fear me , thou wilt receive instruction ; so their dwelling should not be cut off , howsoever i punished them : but they rose early , and corrupted all their doings .
which things are an allegory : for these are the two covenants ; the one from the mount sinai , which gendereth to bondage , which is agar .
her prophets are light and treacherous persons : her priests have polluted the sanctuary , they have done violence to the law .
for this agar is mount sinai in arabia , and answereth to jerusalem which now is , and is in bondage with her children .
the just lord is in the midst thereof ; he will not do iniquity : every morning doth he bring his judgment to light , he faileth not ; but the unjust knoweth no shame .
and samson said unto them , i will now put forth a riddle unto you : if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast , and find it out , then i will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments :
and it came to pass , when they saw him , that they brought thirty companions to be with him .
so his father went down unto the woman : and samson made there a feast ; for so used the young men to do .
is not this thy fear , thy confidence , thy hope , and the uprightness of thy ways ?
but now it is come upon thee , and thou faintest ; it toucheth thee , and thou art troubled .
thy words have upholden him that was falling , and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees .
behold , thou hast instructed many , and thou hast strengthened the weak hands .
if we assay to commune with thee , wilt thou be grieved ? but who can withhold himself from speaking ?
then eliphaz the temanite answered and said ,
but samson ' s wife was given to his companion , whom he had used as his friend .
whosoever abideth in him sinneth not : whosoever sinneth hath not seen him , neither known him .
and ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins ; and in him is no sin .
whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law : for sin is the transgression of the law .
beloved , now are we the sons of god , and it doth not yet appear what we shall be : but we know that , when he shall appear , we shall be like him ; for we shall see him as he is .
remember , i pray thee , who ever perished , being innocent ? or where were the righteous cut off ?
behold , what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us , that we should be called the sons of god : therefore the world knoweth us not , because it knew him not .
even as i have seen , they that plow iniquity , and sow wickedness , reap the same .
by the blast of god they perish , and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed .
and she wept before him the seven days , while their feast lasted : and it came to pass on the seventh day , that he told her , because she lay sore upon him : and she told the riddle to the children of her people .
and the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down , what is sweeter than honey ? and what is stronger than a lion ? and he said unto them , if ye had not plowed with my heifer , ye had not found out my riddle .
and the spirit of the lord came upon him , and he went down to ashkelon , and slew thirty men of them , and took their spoil , and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle . and his anger was kindled , and he went up to his father ' s house .
but if ye cannot declare it me , then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments . and they said unto him , put forth thy riddle , that we may hear it .
whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin ; for his seed remaineth in him : and he cannot sin , because he is born of god .
and he said unto them , out of the eater came forth meat , and out of the strong came forth sweetness . and they could not in three days expound the riddle .
he that committeth sin is of the devil ; for the devil sinneth from the beginning . for this purpose the son of god was manifested , that he might destroy the works of the devil .
and it came to pass on the seventh day , that they said unto samson ' s wife , entice thy husband , that he may declare unto us the riddle , lest we burn thee and thy father ' s house with fire : have ye called us to take that we have ? is it not so ?
little children , let no man deceive you : he that doeth righteousness is righteous , even as he is righteous .
and i saw an angel standing in the sun ; and he cried with a loud voice , saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven , come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great god ;
and he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written , king of kings , and lord of lords .
and there came a messenger , and told him , saying , they have brought the heads of the king ' s sons . and he said , lay ye them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning .
and i saw the beast , and the kings of the earth , and their armies , gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse , and against his army .
that ye may eat the flesh of kings , and the flesh of captains , and the flesh of mighty men , and the flesh of horses , and of them that sit on them , and the flesh of all men , both free and bond , both small and great .
and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood : and his name is called the word of god .
his eyes were as a flame of fire , and on his head were many crowns ; and he had a name written , that no man knew , but he himself .
and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword , that with it he should smite the nations : and he shall rule them with a rod of iron : and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of almighty god .
and it came to pass in the morning , that he went out , and stood , and said to all the people , ye be righteous : behold , i conspired against my master , and slew him : but who slew all these ?
and i fell at his feet to worship him . and he said unto me , see thou do it not : i am thy fellowservant , and of thy brethren that have the testimony of jesus : worship god : for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy .
and i saw heaven opened , and behold a white horse ; and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true , and in righteousness he doth judge and make war .
but they were exceedingly afraid , and said , behold , two kings stood not before him : how then shall we stand ?
look even out the best and meetest of your master ' s sons , and set him on his father ' s throne , and fight for your master ' s house .
now as soon as this letter cometh to you , seeing your master ' s sons are with you , and there are with you chariots and horses , a fenced city also , and armour ;
and ahab had seventy sons in samaria . and jehu wrote letters , and sent to samaria , unto the rulers of jezreel , to the elders , and to them that brought up ahab ' s children , saying ,
they that be slain with the sword are better than they that be slain with hunger : for these pine away , stricken through for want of the fruits of the field .
their visage is blacker than a coal ; they are not known in the streets : their skin cleaveth to their bones ; it is withered , it is become like a stick .
her nazarites were purer than snow , they were whiter than milk , they were more ruddy in body than rubies , their polishing was of sapphire :
for the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of sodom , that was overthrown as in a moment , and no hands stayed on her .
the tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst : the young children ask bread , and no man breaketh it unto them .
even the sea monsters draw out the breast , they give suck to their young ones : the daughter of my people is become cruel , like the ostriches in the wilderness .
the precious sons of zion , comparable to fine gold , how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers , the work of the hands of the potter !
how is the gold become dim ! how is the most fine gold changed ! the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street .
then the channels of waters were seen , and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke , o lord , at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils .
yea , he sent out his arrows , and scattered them ; and he shot out lightnings , and discomfited them .
the lord also thundered in the heavens , and the highest gave his voice ; hail stones and coals of fire .
at the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed , hail stones and coals of fire .
he made darkness his secret place ; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies .
and he rode upon a cherub , and did fly : yea , he did fly upon the wings of the wind .
they prevented me in the day of my calamity : but the lord was my stay .
he brought me forth also into a large place ; he delivered me , because he delighted in me .
he sent from above , he took me , he drew me out of many waters .
he delivered me from my strong enemy , and from them which hated me : for they were too strong for me .
the lord rewarded me according to my righteousness ; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me .
for i have kept the ways of the lord , and have not wickedly departed from my god .
for all his judgments were before me , and i did not put away his statutes from me .
i was also upright before him , and i kept myself from mine iniquity .
with the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful ; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright ;
with the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure ; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward .
for thou wilt light my candle : the lord my god will enlighten my darkness .
for thou wilt save the afflicted people ; but wilt bring down high looks .
for by thee i have run through a troop ; and by my god have i leaped over a wall .
it is god that girdeth me with strength , and maketh my way perfect .
he maketh my feet like hinds ' feet , and setteth me upon my high places .
as for god , his way is perfect : the word of the lord is tried : he is a buckler to all those that trust in him .
for who is god save the lord ? or who is a rock save our god ?
thou hast enlarged my steps under me , that my feet did not slip .
i have pursued mine enemies , and overtaken them : neither did i turn again till they were consumed .
he teacheth my hands to war , so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms .
take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them , after that they be destroyed from before thee ; and that thou inquire not after their gods , saying , how did these nations serve their gods ? even so will i do likewise .
thou shalt not do so unto the lord thy god : for every abomination to the lord , which he hateth , have they done unto their gods ; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods .
what thing soever i command you , observe to do it : thou shalt not add thereto , nor diminish from it .
for thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle : thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me .
i have wounded them that they were not able to rise : they are fallen under my feet .
the strangers shall fade away , and be afraid out of their close places .
the lord liveth ; and blessed be my rock ; and let the god of my salvation be exalted .
it is god that avengeth me , and subdueth the people under me .
he delivereth me from mine enemies : yea , thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me : thou hast delivered me from the violent man .
they cried , but there was none to save them : even unto the lord , but he answered them not .
then did i beat them small as the dust before the wind : i did cast them out as the dirt in the streets .
thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people ; and thou hast made me the head of the heathen : a people whom i have not known shall serve me .
moreover i have given to thee one portion above thy brethren , which i took out of the hand of the amorite with my sword and with my bow .
thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies ; that i might destroy them that hate me .
if the place which the lord thy god hath chosen to put his name there be too far from thee , then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock , which the lord hath given thee , as i have commanded thee , and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after .
even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten , so thou shalt eat them : the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike .
when the lord thy god shall enlarge thy border , as he hath promised thee , and thou shalt say , i will eat flesh , because thy soul longeth to eat flesh ; thou mayest eat flesh , whatsoever thy soul lusteth after .
thou shalt not eat it ; that it may go well with thee , and with thy children after thee , when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the lord .
only thy holy things which thou hast , and thy vows , thou shalt take , and go unto the place which the lord shall choose :
thou shalt not eat it ; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water .
when the lord thy god shall cut off the nations from before thee , whither thou goest to possess them , and thou succeedest them , and dwellest in their land ;
therefore will i give thanks unto thee , o lord , among the heathen , and sing praises unto thy name .
and thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings , the flesh and the blood , upon the altar of the lord thy god : and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the lord thy god , and thou shalt eat the flesh .
observe and hear all these words which i command thee , that it may go well with thee , and with thy children after thee for ever , when thou doest that which is good and right in the sight of the lord thy god .
the angel which redeemed me from all evil , bless the lads ; and let my name be named on them , and the name of my fathers abraham and isaac ; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth .
and he blessed joseph , and said , god , before whom my fathers abraham and isaac did walk , the god which fed me all my life long unto this day ,
but it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing , and not only when i am present with you .
they zealously affect you , but not well ; yea , they would exclude you , that ye might affect them .
and when joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of ephraim , it displeased him : and he held up his father ' s hand , to remove it from ephraim ' s head unto manasseh ' s head .
and joseph brought them out from between his knees , and he bowed himself with his face to the earth .
and israel said unto joseph , i had not thought to see thy face : and , lo , god hath shewed me also thy seed .
and israel stretched out his right hand , and laid it upon ephraim ' s head , who was the younger , and his left hand upon manasseh ' s head , guiding his hands wittingly ; for manasseh was the firstborn .
and joseph took them both , ephraim in his right hand toward israel ' s left hand , and manasseh in his left hand toward israel ' s right hand , and brought them near unto him .
remember therefore from whence thou art fallen , and repent , and do the first works ; or else i will come unto thee quickly , and will remove thy candlestick out of his place , except thou repent .
brethren , i beseech you , be as i am ; for i am as ye are : ye have not injured me at all .
great deliverance giveth he to his king ; and sheweth mercy to his anointed , to david , and to his seed for evermore .
but this thou hast , that thou hatest the deeds of the nicolaitans , which i also hate .
i am afraid of you , lest i have bestowed upon you labour in vain .
and hast borne , and hast patience , and for my name ' s sake hast laboured , and hast not fainted .
ye observe days , and months , and times , and years .
nevertheless i have somewhat against thee , because thou hast left thy first love .
i know thy works , and tribulation , and poverty , ( but thou art rich ) and i know the blasphemy of them which say they are jews , and are not , but are the synagogue of satan .
am i therefore become your enemy , because i tell you the truth ?
where is then the blessedness ye spake of ? for i bear you record , that , if it had been possible , ye would have plucked out your own eyes , and have given them to me .
and his father refused , and said , i know it , my son , i know it : he also shall become a people , and he also shall be great : but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he , and his seed shall become a multitude of nations .
he that hath an ear , let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches ; to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the tree of life , which is in the midst of the paradise of god .
and my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not , nor rejected ; but received me as an angel of god , even as christ jesus .
and unto the angel of the church in smyrna write ; these things saith the first and the last , which was dead , and is alive ;
ye know how through infirmity of the flesh i preached the gospel unto you at the first .
but when ye go over jordan , and dwell in the land which the lord your god giveth you to inherit , and when he giveth you rest from all your enemies round about , so that ye dwell in safety ;
and ye shall rejoice before the lord your god , ye , and your sons , and your daughters , and your menservants , and your maidservants , and the levite that is within your gates ; forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with you .
take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seest :
and he blessed them that day , saying , in thee shall israel bless , saying , god make thee as ephraim and as manasseh : and he set ephraim before manasseh .
but in the place which the lord shall choose in one of thy tribes , there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings , and there thou shalt do all that i command thee .
and israel said unto joseph , behold , i die : but god shall be with you , and bring you again unto the land of your fathers .
notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates , whatsoever thy soul lusteth after , according to the blessing of the lord thy god which he hath given thee : the unclean and the clean may eat thereof , as of the roebuck , and as of the hart .
only ye shall not eat the blood ; ye shall pour it upon the earth as water .
thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn , or of thy wine , or of thy oil , or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock , nor any of thy vows which thou vowest , nor thy freewill offerings , or heave offering of thine hand :
take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the levite as long as thou livest upon the earth .
and the scribes and pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery ; and when they had set her in the midst ,
they say , if a man put away his wife , and she go from him , and become another man ' s , shall he return unto her again ? shall not that land be greatly polluted ? but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers ; yet return again to me , saith the lord .
they say unto him , master , this woman was taken in adultery , in the very act .
jesus went unto the mount of olives .
and early in the morning he came again into the temple , and all the people came unto him ; and he sat down , and taught them .
will he reserve his anger for ever ? will he keep it to the end ? behold , thou hast spoken and done evil things as thou couldest .
wilt thou not from this time cry unto me , my father , thou art the guide of my youth ?
now the eyes of israel were dim for age , so that he could not see . and he brought them near unto him ; and he kissed them , and embraced them .
therefore the showers have been withholden , and there hath been no latter rain ; and thou hadst a whore ' s forehead , thou refusedst to be ashamed .
lift up thine eyes unto the high places , and see where thou hast not been lien with . in the ways hast thou sat for them , as the arabian in the wilderness ; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness .
and it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom , that she defiled the land , and committed adultery with stones and with stocks .
and i saw , when for all the causes whereby backsliding israel committed adultery i had put her away , and given her a bill of divorce ; yet her treacherous sister judah feared not , but went and played the harlot also .
and they which heard it , being convicted by their own conscience , went out one by one , beginning at the eldest , even unto the last : and jesus was left alone , and the woman standing in the midst .
the lord said also unto me in the days of josiah the king , hast thou seen that which backsliding israel hath done ? she is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree , and there hath played the harlot .
and again he stooped down , and wrote on the ground .
now moses in the law commanded us , that such should be stoned : but what sayest thou ?
this they said , tempting him , that they might have to accuse him . but jesus stooped down , and with his finger wrote on the ground , as though he heard them not .
for unto which of the angels said he at any time , thou art my son , this day have i begotten thee ? and again , i will be to him a father , and he shall be to me a son ?
being made so much better than the angels , as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they .
who being the brightness of his glory , and the express image of his person , and upholding all things by the word of his power , when he had by himself purged our sins , sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high ;
hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son , whom he hath appointed heir of all things , by whom also he made the worlds ;
thou hast loved righteousness , and hated iniquity ; therefore god , even thy god , hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows .
but unto the son he saith , thy throne , o god , is for ever and ever : a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom .
and of the angels he saith , who maketh his angels spirits , and his ministers a flame of fire .
god , who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets ,
and moses said , we will go with our young and with our old , with our sons and with our daughters , with our flocks and with our herds will we go ; for we must hold a feast unto the lord .
and they shall cover the face of the earth , that one cannot be able to see the earth : and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped , which remaineth unto you from the hail , and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field :
and they shall fill thy houses , and the houses of all thy servants , and the houses of all the egyptians ; which neither thy fathers , nor thy fathers ' fathers have seen , since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day . and he turned himself , and went out from pharaoh .
and pharaoh ' s servants said unto him , how long shall this man be a snare unto us ? let the men go , that they may serve the lord their god : knowest thou not yet that egypt is destroyed ?
and moses and aaron were brought again unto pharaoh : and he said unto them , go , serve the lord your god : but who are they that shall go ?
and the lord said unto moses , go in unto pharaoh : for i have hardened his heart , and the heart of his servants , that i might shew these my signs before him :
and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son , and of thy son ' s son , what things i have wrought in egypt , and my signs which i have done among them ; that ye may know how that i am the lord .
and moses and aaron came in unto pharaoh , and said unto him , thus saith the lord god of the hebrews , how long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me ? let my people go , that they may serve me .
else , if thou refuse to let my people go , behold , to morrow will i bring the locusts into thy coast :
yet shall he be brought to the grave , and shall remain in the tomb .
who shall declare his way to his face ? and who shall repay him what he hath done ?
how then comfort ye me in vain , seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood ?
the clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him , and every man shall draw after him , as there are innumerable before him .
and moses told the children of israel according to all that the lord commanded moses .
ye serpents , ye generation of vipers , how can ye escape the damnation of hell ?
fill ye up then the measure of your fathers .
wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves , that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets .
and say , if we had been in the days of our fathers , we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets .
o jerusalem , jerusalem , thou that killest the prophets , and stonest them which are sent unto thee , how often would i have gathered thy children together , even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings , and ye would not !
verily i say unto you , all these things shall come upon this generation .
that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth , from the blood of righteous abel unto the blood of zacharias son of barachias , whom ye slew between the temple and the altar .
that the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction ? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath .
wherefore , behold , i send unto you prophets , and wise men , and scribes : and some of them ye shall kill and crucify ; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues , and persecute them from city to city :
for i say unto you , ye shall not see me henceforth , till ye shall say , blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord .
behold , your house is left unto you desolate .
and the kinsman said , i cannot redeem it for myself , lest i mar mine own inheritance : redeem thou my right to thyself ; for i cannot redeem it .
then said boaz , what day thou buyest the field of the hand of naomi , thou must buy it also of ruth the moabitess , the wife of the dead , to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance .
and one goat for a sin offering ; beside the continual burnt offering , and his meat offering , and his drink offering .
and boaz said unto the elders , and unto all the people , ye are witnesses this day , that i have bought all that was elimelech ' s , and all that was chilion ' s and mahlon ' s , of the hand of naomi .
therefore the kinsman said unto boaz , buy it for thee . so he drew off his shoe .
now this was the manner in former time in israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing , for to confirm all things ; a man plucked off his shoe , and gave it to his neighbour : and this was a testimony in israel .
and one goat for a sin offering ; beside the continual burnt offering , his meat offering , and his drink offering .
on the eighth day ye shall have a solemn assembly : ye shall do no servile work therein :
but ye shall offer a burnt offering , a sacrifice made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the lord : one bullock , one ram , seven lambs of the first year without blemish :
son of man , there were two women , the daughters of one mother :
their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullock , for the ram , and for the lambs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
the word of the lord came again unto me , saying ,
and their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks , for the rams , and for the lambs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
and one goat for a sin offering ; beside the continual burnt offering , his meat offering , and his drink offering .
and on the seventh day seven bullocks , two rams , and fourteen lambs of the first year without blemish :
and their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks , for the rams , and for the lambs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
whoso therefore shall swear by the altar , sweareth by it , and by all things thereon .
neither left she her whoredoms brought from egypt : for in her youth they lay with her , and they bruised the breasts of her virginity , and poured their whoredom upon her .
wherefore i have delivered her into the hand of her lovers , into the hand of the assyrians , upon whom she doted .
and he that shall swear by heaven , sweareth by the throne of god , and by him that sitteth thereon .
and whoso shall swear by the temple , sweareth by it , and by him that dwelleth therein .
and they committed whoredoms in egypt ; they committed whoredoms in their youth : there were their breasts pressed , and there they bruised the teats of their virginity .
ye blind guides , which strain at a gnat , and swallow a camel .
and the names of them were aholah the elder , and aholibah her sister : and they were mine , and they bare sons and daughters . thus were their names ; samaria is aholah , and jerusalem aholibah .
woe unto you , scribes and pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin , and have omitted the weightier matters of the law , judgment , mercy , and faith : these ought ye to have done , and not to leave the other undone .
and aholah played the harlot when she was mine ; and she doted on her lovers , on the assyrians her neighbours ,
thou blind pharisee , cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter , that the outside of them may be clean also .
which were clothed with blue , captains and rulers , all of them desirable young men , horsemen riding upon horses .
woe unto you , scribes and pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter , but within they are full of extortion and excess .
even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men , but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity .
woe unto you , scribes and pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres , which indeed appear beautiful outward , but are within full of dead men ' s bones , and of all uncleanness .
then went boaz up to the gate , and sat him down there : and , behold , the kinsman of whom boaz spake came by ; unto whom he said , ho , such a one ! turn aside , sit down here . and he turned aside , and sat down .
and he took ten men of the elders of the city , and said , sit ye down here . and they sat down .
and he brought the meat offering , and took an handful thereof , and burnt it upon the altar , beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning .
and on the sixth day eight bullocks , two rams , and fourteen lambs of the first year without blemish :
he slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings , which was for the people : and aaron ' s sons presented unto him the blood , which he sprinkled upon the altar round about ,
and the fat of the bullock and of the ram , the rump , and that which covereth the inwards , and the kidneys , and the caul above the liver :
and their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks , for the rams , and for the lambs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
and one goat for a sin offering ; beside the continual burnt offering , and his meat offering , and his drink offering .
they are as stubble before the wind , and as chaff that the storm carrieth away .
how oft is the candle of the wicked put out ! and how oft cometh their destruction upon them ! god distributeth sorrows in his anger .
god layeth up his iniquity for his children : he rewardeth him , and he shall know it .
therefore they say unto god , depart from us ; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways .
but the fat , and the kidneys , and the caul above the liver of the sin offering , he burnt upon the altar ; as the lord commanded moses .
and one goat for a sin offering ; beside the continual burnt offering , and his meat offering , and his drink offering .
they spend their days in wealth , and in a moment go down to the grave .
and the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp .
lo , their good is not in their hand : the counsel of the wicked is far from me .
and he slew the burnt offering ; and aaron ' s sons presented unto him the blood , which he sprinkled round about upon the altar .
and on the third day eleven bullocks , two rams , fourteen lambs of the first year without blemish ;
what is the almighty , that we should serve him ? and what profit should we have , if we pray unto him ?
and they presented the burnt offering unto him , with the pieces thereof , and the head : and he burnt them upon the altar .
and one kid of the goats for a sin offering ; beside the continual burnt offering , his meat offering , and his drink offering .
their bull gendereth , and faileth not ; their cow calveth , and casteth not her calf .
and he did wash the inwards and the legs , and burnt them upon the burnt offering on the altar .
and on the fifth day nine bullocks , two rams , and fourteen lambs of the first year without spot :
and he brought the people ' s offering , and took the goat , which was the sin offering for the people , and slew it , and offered it for sin , as the first .
and on the fourth day ten bullocks , two rams , and fourteen lambs of the first year without blemish :
they take the timbrel and harp , and rejoice at the sound of the organ .
and he brought the burnt offering , and offered it according to the manner .
their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks , for the rams , and for the lambs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
they send forth their little ones like a flock , and their children dance .
woe unto you , scribes and pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte , and when he is made , ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves .
woe unto you , scribes and pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye devour widows ' houses , and for a pretence make long prayer : therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation .
but woe unto you , scribes and pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men : for ye neither go in yourselves , neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in .
and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased ; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted .
neither be ye called masters : for one is your master , even christ .
ye fools and blind : for whether is greater , the gift , or the altar that sanctifieth the gift ?
and , whosoever shall swear by the altar , it is nothing ; but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it , he is guilty .
woe unto you , ye blind guides , which say , whosoever shall swear by the temple , it is nothing ; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple , he is a debtor !
and one kid of the goats for a sin offering ; beside the continual burnt offering , his meat offering , and his drink offering .
and on the second day ye shall offer twelve young bullocks , two rams , fourteen lambs of the first year without spot :
and their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks , for the rams , and for the lambs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
and one kid of the goats for a sin offering ; beside the continual burnt offering , and the meat offering thereof , and their drink offerings .
have ye not asked them that go by the way ? and do ye not know their tokens ,
and aaron lifted up his hand toward the people , and blessed them , and came down from offering of the sin offering , and the burnt offering , and peace offerings .
behold , i know your thoughts , and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me .
and moses and aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation , and came out , and blessed the people : and the glory of the lord appeared unto all the people .
they shall lie down alike in the dust , and the worms shall cover them .
and they put the fat upon the breasts , and he burnt the fat upon the altar :
a several tenth deal for one lamb , throughout the seven lambs :
and another dieth in the bitterness of his soul , and never eateth with pleasure .
and the breasts and the right shoulder aaron waved for a wave offering before the lord ; as moses commanded .
one kid of the goats for a sin offering ; beside the sin offering of atonement , and the continual burnt offering , and the meat offering of it , and their drink offerings .
his breasts are full of milk , and his bones are moistened with marrow .
and on the fifteenth day of the seventh month ye shall have an holy convocation ; ye shall do no servile work , and ye shall keep a feast unto the lord seven days :
one dieth in his full strength , being wholly at ease and quiet .
and ye shall offer a burnt offering , a sacrifice made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the lord ; thirteen young bullocks , two rams , and fourteen lambs of the first year ; they shall be without blemish :
shall any teach god knowledge ? seeing he judgeth those that are high .
and there came a fire out from before the lord , and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat : which when all the people saw , they shouted , and fell on their faces .
and their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil , three tenth deals unto every bullock of the thirteen bullocks , two tenth deals to each ram of the two rams ,
for what pleasure hath he in his house after him , when the number of his months is cut off in the midst ?
and a several tenth deal to each lamb of the fourteen lambs :
his eyes shall see his destruction , and he shall drink of the wrath of the almighty .
and abraham was old , and well stricken in age : and the lord had blessed abraham in all things .
and the servant said unto him , peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land : must i needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest ?
but thou shalt go unto my country , and to my kindred , and take a wife unto my son isaac .
and i will make thee swear by the lord , the god of heaven , and the god of the earth , that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the canaanites , among whom i dwell :
and abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house , that ruled over all that he had , put , i pray thee , thy hand under my thigh :
and the servant put his hand under the thigh of abraham his master , and sware to him concerning that matter .
and if the woman will not be willing to follow thee , then thou shalt be clear from this my oath : only bring not my son thither again .
and abraham said unto him , beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again .
and that ye study to be quiet , and to do your own business , and to work with your own hands , as we commanded you ;
and indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all macedonia : but we beseech you , brethren , that ye increase more and more ;
and those which remain shall hear , and fear , and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil among you .
and thine eye shall not pity ; but life shall go for life , eye for eye , tooth for tooth , hand for hand , foot for foot .
and the judges shall make diligent inquisition : and , behold , if the witness be a false witness , and hath testified falsely against his brother ;
then both the men , between whom the controversy is , shall stand before the lord , before the priests and the judges , which shall be in those days ;
if a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him that which is wrong ;
one witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity , or for any sin , in any sin that he sinneth : at the mouth of two witnesses , or at the mouth of three witnesses , shall the matter be established .
thou shalt not remove thy neighbour ' s landmark , which they of old time have set in thine inheritance , which thou shalt inherit in the land that the lord thy god giveth thee to possess it .
thine eye shall not pity him , but thou shalt put away the guilt of innocent blood from israel , that it may go well with thee .
then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence , and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood , that he may die .
but if any man hate his neighbour , and lie in wait for him , and rise up against him , and smite him mortally that he die , and fleeth into one of these cities :
that ye may walk honestly toward them that are without , and that ye may have lack of nothing .
but i would not have you to be ignorant , brethren , concerning them which are asleep , that ye sorrow not , even as others which have no hope .
for if we believe that jesus died and rose again , even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him .
for this we say unto you by the word of the lord , that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep .
for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout , with the voice of the archangel , and with the trump of god : and the dead in christ shall rise first :
then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds , to meet the lord in the air : and so shall we ever be with the lord .
wherefore comfort one another with these words .
then shall ye do unto him , as he had thought to have done unto his brother : so shalt thou put the evil away from among you .
that innocent blood be not shed in thy land , which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance , and so blood be upon thee .
whither the forerunner is for us entered , even jesus , made an high priest for ever after the order of melchisedec .
so when they were dismissed , they came to antioch : and when they had gathered the multitude together , they delivered the epistle :
forasmuch as we have heard , that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words , subverting your souls , saying , ye must be circumcised , and keep the law : to whom we gave no such commandment :
it seemed good unto us , being assembled with one accord , to send chosen men unto you with our beloved barnabas and paul ,
men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our lord jesus christ .
we have sent therefore judas and silas , who shall also tell you the same things by mouth .
for of this sort are they which creep into houses , and lead captive silly women laden with sins , led away with divers lusts ,
ever learning , and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth .
for moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him , being read in the synagogues every sabbath day .
now as jannes and jambres withstood moses , so do these also resist the truth : men of corrupt minds , reprobate concerning the faith .
then pleased it the apostles and elders , with the whole church , to send chosen men of their own company to antioch with paul and barnabas ; namely , judas surnamed barsabas , and silas , chief men among the brethren :
but they shall proceed no further : for their folly shall be manifest unto all men , as theirs also was .
and they wrote letters by them after this manner ; the apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the gentiles in antioch and syria and cilicia :
for men shall be lovers of their own selves , covetous , boasters , proud , blasphemers , disobedient to parents , unthankful , unholy ,
traitors , heady , highminded , lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god ;
having a form of godliness , but denying the power thereof : from such turn away .
for it seemed good to the holy ghost , and to us , to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things ;
that ye abstain from meats offered to idols , and from blood , and from things strangled , and from fornication : from which if ye keep yourselves , ye shall do well . fare ye well .
this know also , that in the last days perilous times shall come .
and we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end :
for god is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love , which ye have shewed toward his name , in that ye have ministered to the saints , and do minister .
for when god made promise to abraham , because he could swear by no greater , he sware by himself ,
that ye be not slothful , but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises .
and he went through syria and cilicia , confirming the churches .
and paul chose silas , and departed , being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of god .
and barnabas determined to take with them john , whose surname was mark .
but paul thought not good to take him with them , who departed from them from pamphylia , and went not with them to the work .
paul also and barnabas continued in antioch , teaching and preaching the word of the lord , with many others also .
and some days after paul said unto barnabas , let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the lord , and see how they do .
and after they had tarried there a space , they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles .
notwithstanding it pleased silas to abide there still .
which when they had read , they rejoiced for the consolation .
and judas and silas , being prophets also themselves , exhorted the brethren with many words , and confirmed them .
that by two immutable things , in which it was impossible for god to lie , we might have a strong consolation , who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us :
which hope we have as an anchor of the soul , both sure and stedfast , and which entereth into that within the veil ;
saying , surely blessing i will bless thee , and multiplying i will multiply thee .
and so , after he had patiently endured , he obtained the promise .
for men verily swear by the greater : and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife .
and the contention was so sharp between them , that they departed asunder one from the other : and so barnabas took mark , and sailed unto cyprus ;
wherein god , willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel , confirmed it by an oath :
nevertheless we made our prayer unto our god , and set a watch against them day and night , because of them .
and the sea coast shall be dwellings and cottages for shepherds , and folds for flocks .
woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast , the nation of the cherethites ! the word of the lord is against you ; o canaan , the land of the philistines , i will even destroy thee , that there shall be no inhabitant .
but it came to pass , that when sanballat , and tobiah , and the arabians , and the ammonites , and the ashdodites , heard that the walls of jerusalem were made up , and that the breaches began to be stopped , then they were very wroth ,
i have heard the reproach of moab , and the revilings of the children of ammon , whereby they have reproached my people , and magnified themselves against their border .
and conspired all of them together to come and to fight against jerusalem , and to hinder it .
and the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of judah ; they shall feed thereupon : in the houses of ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening : for the lord their god shall visit them , and turn away their captivity .
and cover not their iniquity , and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee : for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders .
before the decree bring forth , before the day pass as the chaff , before the fierce anger of the lord come upon you , before the day of the lord ' s anger come upon you .
so built we the wall ; and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof : for the people had a mind to work .
gather yourselves together , yea , gather together , o nation not desired ;
now tobiah the ammonite was by him , and he said , even that which they build , if a fox go up , he shall even break down their stone wall .
for gaza shall be forsaken , and ashkelon a desolation : they shall drive out ashdod at the noon day , and ekron shall be rooted up .
hear , o our god ; for we are despised : and turn their reproach upon their own head , and give them for a prey in the land of captivity :
seek ye the lord , all ye meek of the earth , which have wrought his judgment ; seek righteousness , seek meekness : it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the lord ' s anger .
but we believe that through the grace of the lord jesus christ we shall be saved , even as they .
then all the multitude kept silence , and gave audience to barnabas and paul , declaring what miracles and wonders god had wrought among the gentiles by them .
but it came to pass , that when sanballat heard that we builded the wall , he was wroth , and took great indignation , and mocked the jews .
now therefore why tempt ye god , to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples , which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear ?
and to this agree the words of the prophets ; as it is written ,
after this i will return , and will build again the tabernacle of david , which is fallen down ; and i will build again the ruins thereof , and i will set it up :
and after they had held their peace , james answered , saying , men and brethren , hearken unto me :
simeon hath declared how god at the first did visit the gentiles , to take out of them a people for his name .
wherefore my sentence is , that we trouble not them , which from among the gentiles are turned to god :
that the residue of men might seek after the lord , and all the gentiles , upon whom my name is called , saith the lord , who doeth all these things .
known unto god are all his works from the beginning of the world .
as the apple tree among the trees of the wood , so is my beloved among the sons . i sat down under his shadow with great delight , and his fruit was sweet to my taste .
as the lily among thorns , so is my love among the daughters .
i am the rose of sharon , and the lily of the valleys .
and it was told him by certain which said , thy mother and thy brethren stand without , desiring to see thee .
slay them not , lest my people forget : scatter them by thy power ; and bring them down , o lord our shield .
and he answered and said unto them , my mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of god , and do it .
call now , if there be any that will answer thee ; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn ?
for the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride : and for cursing and lying which they speak .
now it came to pass on a certain day , that he went into a ship with his disciples : and he said unto them , let us go over unto the other side of the lake . and they launched forth .
but as they sailed he fell asleep : and there came down a storm of wind on the lake ; and they were filled with water , and were in jeopardy .
his children are far from safety , and they are crushed in the gate , neither is there any to deliver them .
whose harvest the hungry eateth up , and taketh it even out of the thorns , and the robber swalloweth up their substance .
for wrath killeth the foolish man , and envy slayeth the silly one .
i have seen the foolish taking root : but suddenly i cursed his habitation .
remember therefore how thou hast received and heard , and hold fast , and repent . if therefore thou shalt not watch , i will come on thee as a thief , and thou shalt not know what hour i will come upon thee .
( for he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man . for oftentimes it had caught him : and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters ; and he brake the bands , and was driven of the devil into the wilderness . )
be watchful , and strengthen the things which remain , that are ready to die : for i have not found thy works perfect before god .
he that overcometh , the same shall be clothed in white raiment ; and i will not blot out his name out of the book of life , but i will confess his name before my father , and before his angels .
thou hast a few names even in sardis which have not defiled their garments ; and they shall walk with me in white : for they are worthy .
unto thee , o my strength , will i sing : for god is my defence , and the god of my mercy .
and to the angel of the church in philadelphia write ; these things saith he that is holy , he that is true , he that hath the key of david , he that openeth , and no man shutteth ; and shutteth , and no man openeth ;
and he said unto them , where is your faith ? and they being afraid wondered , saying one to another , what manner of man is this ! for he commandeth even the winds and water , and they obey him .
but i will sing of thy power ; yea , i will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning : for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble .
he that hath an ear , let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches .
let them wander up and down for meat , and grudge if they be not satisfied .
behold , i will make them of the synagogue of satan , which say they are jews , and are not , but do lie ; behold , i will make them to come and worship before thy feet , and to know that i have loved thee .
and when he went forth to land , there met him out of the city a certain man , which had devils long time , and ware no clothes , neither abode in any house , but in the tombs .
and at evening let them return ; and let them make a noise like a dog , and go round about the city .
i know thy works : behold , i have set before thee an open door , and no man can shut it : for thou hast a little strength , and hast kept my word , and hast not denied my name .
and they arrived at the country of the gadarenes , which is over against galilee .
consume them in wrath , consume them , that they may not be : and let them know that god ruleth in jacob unto the ends of the earth . selah .
his left hand is under my head , and his right hand doth embrace me .
i charge you , o ye daughters of jerusalem , by the roes , and by the hinds of the field , that ye stir not up , nor awake my love , till he please .
he brought me to the banqueting house , and his banner over me was love .
stay me with flagons , comfort me with apples : for i am sick of love .
the voice of my beloved ! behold , he cometh leaping upon the mountains , skipping upon the hills .
my beloved is like a roe or a young hart : behold , he standeth behind our wall , he looketh forth at the windows , shewing himself through the lattice .
then went the devils out of the man , and entered into the swine : and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake , and were choked .
when they that fed them saw what was done , they fled , and went and told it in the city and in the country .
and they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep .
and there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain : and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them . and he suffered them .
yet man is born unto trouble , as the sparks fly upward .
although affliction cometh not forth of the dust , neither doth trouble spring out of the ground ;
which doeth great things and unsearchable ; marvellous things without number :
return to thine own house , and shew how great things god hath done unto thee . and he went his way , and published throughout the whole city how great things jesus had done unto him .
i would seek unto god , and unto god would i commit my cause :
now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him : but jesus sent him away , saying ,
then the whole multitude of the country of the gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them ; for they were taken with great fear : and he went up into the ship , and returned back again .
they also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed .
then they went out to see what was done ; and came to jesus , and found the man , out of whom the devils were departed , sitting at the feet of jesus , clothed , and in his right mind : and they were afraid .
thus the children of israel were brought under at that time , and the children of judah prevailed , because they relied upon the lord god of their fathers .
and abijah pursued after jeroboam , and took cities from him , bethel with the towns thereof , and jeshnah with the towns thereof , and ephrain with the towns thereof .
and lay siege against it , and build a fort against it , and cast a mount against it ; set the camp also against it , and set battering rams against it round about .
moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan , and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city : and set thy face against it , and it shall be besieged , and thou shalt lay siege against it . this shall be a sign to the house of israel .
thou also , son of man , take thee a tile , and lay it before thee , and pourtray upon it the city , even jerusalem :
therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of jerusalem , and thine arm shall be uncovered , and thou shalt prophesy against it .
neither have we obeyed the voice of the lord our god , to walk in his laws , which he set before us by his servants the prophets .
and hezekiah sent to all israel and judah , and wrote letters also to ephraim and manasseh , that they should come to the house of the lord at jerusalem , to keep the passover unto the lord god of israel .
and when thou hast accomplished them , lie again on thy right side , and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of judah forty days : i have appointed thee each day for a year .
help us , o god of our salvation , for the glory of thy name : and deliver us , and purge away our sins , for thy name ' s sake .
for i have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity , according to the number of the days , three hundred and ninety days : so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of israel .
and he hath confirmed his words , which he spake against us , and against our judges that judged us , by bringing upon us a great evil : for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon jerusalem .
o remember not against us former iniquities : let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us : for we are brought very low .
lie thou also upon thy left side , and lay the iniquity of the house of israel upon it : according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity .
and the thing pleased the king and all the congregation .
so they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all israel , from beer - sheba even to dan , that they should come to keep the passover unto the lord god of israel at jerusalem : for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was written .
for the king had taken counsel , and his princes , and all the congregation in jerusalem , to keep the passover in the second month .
take thou also unto thee wheat , and barley , and beans , and lentiles , and millet , and fitches , and put them in one vessel , and make thee bread thereof , according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side , three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof .
for they could not keep it at that time , because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently , neither had the people gathered themselves together to jerusalem .
and , behold , i will lay bands upon thee , and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another , till thou hast ended the days of thy siege .
now be ye not stiffnecked , as your fathers were , but yield yourselves unto the lord , and enter into his sanctuary , which he hath sanctified for ever : and serve the lord your god , that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you .
and abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter : so there fell down slain of israel five hundred thousand chosen men .
for if ye turn again unto the lord , your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive , so that they shall come again into this land : for the lord your god is gracious and merciful , and will not turn away his face from you , if ye return unto him .
and the children of israel fled before judah : and god delivered them into their hand .
the dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven , the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth .
then the men of judah gave a shout : and as the men of judah shouted , it came to pass , that god smote jeroboam and all israel before abijah and judah .
o god , the heathen are come into thine inheritance ; thy holy temple have they defiled ; they have laid jerusalem on heaps .
and be not ye like your fathers , and like your brethren , which trespassed against the lord god of their fathers , who therefore gave them up to desolation , as ye see .
and when judah looked back , behold , the battle was before and behind : and they cried unto the lord , and the priests sounded with the trumpets .
but jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them : so they were before judah , and the ambushment was behind them .
for they have devoured jacob , and laid waste his dwelling place .
and , behold , god himself is with us for our captain , and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you . o children of israel , fight ye not against the lord god of your fathers ; for ye shall not prosper .
pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee , and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name .
how long , lord ? wilt thou be angry for ever ? shall thy jealousy burn like fire ?
but as for us , the lord is our god , and we have not forsaken him ; and the priests , which minister unto the lord , are the sons of aaron , and the levites wait upon their business :
we are become a reproach to our neighbours , a scorn and derision to them that are round about us .
o lord , hear ; o lord , forgive ; o lord , hearken and do ; defer not , for thine own sake , o my god : for thy city and thy people are called by thy name .
and unto the angel of the church in sardis write ; these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of god , and the seven stars ; i know thy works , that thou hast a name that thou livest , and art dead .
now therefore , o our god , hear the prayer of thy servant , and his supplications , and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate , for the lord ' s sake .
o my god , incline thine ear , and hear ; open thine eyes , and behold our desolations , and the city which is called by thy name : for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses , but for thy great mercies .
now the parable is this : the seed is the word of god .
and now , o lord our god , that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of egypt with a mighty hand , and hast gotten thee renown , as at this day ; we have sinned , we have done wickedly .
those by the way side are they that hear ; then cometh the devil , and taketh away the word out of their hearts , lest they should believe and be saved .
o lord , according to all thy righteousness , i beseech thee , let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city jerusalem , thy holy mountain : because for our sins , and for the iniquities of our fathers , jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are about us .
as it is written in the law of moses , all this evil is come upon us : yet made we not our prayer before the lord our god , that we might turn from our iniquities , and understand thy truth .
and he said , unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of god : but to others in parables ; that seeing they might not see , and hearing they might not understand .
therefore hath the lord watched upon the evil , and brought it upon us : for the lord our god is righteous in all his works which he doeth : for we obeyed not his voice .
no man , when he hath lighted a candle , covereth it with a vessel , or putteth it under a bed ; but setteth it on a candlestick , that they which enter in may see the light .
at the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth , and i am come to shew thee ; for thou art greatly beloved : therefore understand the matter , and consider the vision .
but that on the good ground are they , which in an honest and good heart , having heard the word , keep it , and bring forth fruit with patience .
and he informed me , and talked with me , and said , o daniel , i am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding .
and that which fell among thorns are they , which , when they have heard , go forth , and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life , and bring no fruit to perfection .
neither did jeroboam recover strength again in the days of abijah : and the lord struck him , and he died .
yea , whiles i was speaking in prayer , even the man gabriel , whom i had seen in the vision at the beginning , being caused to fly swiftly , touched me about the time of the evening oblation .
they on the rock are they , which , when they hear , receive the word with joy ; and these have no root , which for a while believe , and in time of temptation fall away .
and whiles i was speaking , and praying , and confessing my sin and the sin of my people israel , and presenting my supplication before the lord my god for the holy mountain of my god ;
then came to him his mother and his brethren , and could not come at him for the press .
take heed therefore how ye hear : for whosoever hath , to him shall be given ; and whosoever hath not , from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have .
for nothing is secret , that shall not be made manifest ; neither any thing hid , that shall not be known and come abroad .
and the rest of the acts of abijah , and his ways , and his sayings , are written in the story of the prophet iddo .
but abijah waxed mighty , and married fourteen wives , and begat twenty and two sons , and sixteen daughters .
know therefore and understand , that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build jerusalem unto the messiah the prince shall be seven weeks , and threescore and two weeks : the street shall be built again , and the wall , even in troublous times .
and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week : and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease , and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate , even until the consummation , and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate .
and after threescore and two weeks shall messiah be cut off , but not for himself : and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary ; and the end thereof shall be with a flood , and unto the end of the war desolations are determined .
this is the law of the house ; upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy . behold , this is the law of the house .
and thou shalt give to the priests the levites that be of the seed of zadok , which approach unto me , to minister unto me , saith the lord god , a young bullock for a sin offering .
and he said unto me , son of man , thus saith the lord god ; these are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it , to offer burnt offerings thereon , and to sprinkle blood thereon .
so the altar shall be four cubits ; and from the altar and upward shall be four horns .
and from the bottom upon the ground even to the lower settle shall be two cubits , and the breadth one cubit ; and from the lesser settle even to the greater settle shall be four cubits , and the breadth one cubit .
and the settle shall be fourteen cubits long and fourteen broad in the four squares thereof ; and the border about it shall be half a cubit ; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit about ; and his stairs shall look toward the east .
and the altar shall be twelve cubits long , twelve broad , square in the four squares thereof .
in this was manifested the love of god toward us , because that god sent his only begotten son into the world , that we might live through him .
he that loveth not knoweth not god ; for god is love .
we are of god : he that knoweth god heareth us ; he that is not of god heareth not us . hereby know we the spirit of truth , and the spirit of error .
beloved , believe not every spirit , but try the spirits whether they are of god : because many false prophets are gone out into the world .
they are of the world : therefore speak they of the world , and the world heareth them .
ye are of god , little children , and have overcome them : because greater is he that is in you , than he that is in the world .
and every spirit that confesseth not that jesus christ is come in the flesh is not of god : and this is that spirit of antichrist , whereof ye have heard that it should come ; and even now already is it in the world .
hereby know ye the spirit of god : every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god :
and they beckoned unto their partners , which were in the other ship , that they should come and help them . and they came , and filled both the ships , so that they began to sink .
when simon peter saw it , he fell down at jesus ' knees , saying , depart from me ; for i am a sinful man , o lord .
and , behold , there came a man named jairus , and he was a ruler of the synagogue : and he fell down at jesus ' feet , and besought him that he would come into his house :
and simon answering said unto him , master , we have toiled all the night , and have taken nothing : nevertheless at thy word i will let down the net .
and it came to pass , that , when jesus was returned , the people gladly received him : for they were all waiting for him .
and when they had this done , they inclosed a great multitude of fishes : and their net brake .
and a woman having an issue of blood twelve years , which had spent all her living upon physicians , neither could be healed of any ,
and he entered into one of the ships , which was simon ' s , and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land . and he sat down , and taught the people out of the ship .
for he had one only daughter , about twelve years of age , and she lay a dying . but as he went the people thronged him .
now when he had left speaking , he said unto simon , launch out into the deep , and let down your nets for a draught .
and jesus said , who touched me ? when all denied , peter and they that were with him said , master , the multitude throng thee and press thee , and sayest thou , who touched me ?
and it came to pass , that , as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of god , he stood by the lake of gennesaret ,
came behind him , and touched the border of his garment : and immediately her issue of blood stanched .
and saw two ships standing by the lake : but the fishermen were gone out of them , and were washing their nets .
for he was astonished , and all that were with him , at the draught of the fishes which they had taken :
and jesus said , somebody hath touched me : for i perceive that virtue is gone out of me .
and when the woman saw that she was not hid , she came trembling , and falling down before him , she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed immediately .
and he said unto her , daughter , be of good comfort : thy faith hath made thee whole ; go in peace .
while he yet spake , there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue ' s house , saying to him , thy daughter is dead ; trouble not the master .
and all wept , and bewailed her : but he said , weep not ; she is not dead , but sleepeth .
and when he came into the house , he suffered no man to go in , save peter , and james , and john , and the father and the mother of the maiden .
but when jesus heard it , he answered him , saying , fear not : believe only , and she shall be made whole .
but if any widow have children or nephews , let them learn first to shew piety at home , and to requite their parents : for that is good and acceptable before god .
and her parents were astonished : but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done .
honour widows that are widows indeed .
and her spirit came again , and she arose straightway : and he commanded to give her meat .
the elder women as mothers ; the younger as sisters , with all purity .
and he put them all out , and took her by the hand , and called , saying , maid , arise .
rebuke not an elder , but intreat him as a father ; and the younger men as brethren ;
and they laughed him to scorn , knowing that she was dead .
but if any provide not for his own , and specially for those of his own house , he hath denied the faith , and is worse than an infidel .
and these things give in charge , that they may be blameless .
but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth .
now she that is a widow indeed , and desolate , trusteth in god , and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day .
let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old , having been the wife of one man ,
and thou shalt take of the blood thereof , and put it on the four horns of it , and on the four corners of the settle , and upon the border round about : thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it .
and thou shalt offer them before the lord , and the priests shall cast salt upon them , and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering unto the lord .
when thou hast made an end of cleansing it , thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish , and a ram out of the flock without blemish .
and on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering ; and they shall cleanse the altar , as they did cleanse it with the bullock .
thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering , and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house , without the sanctuary .
and when these days are expired , it shall be , that upon the eighth day , and so forward , the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar , and your peace offerings ; and i will accept you , saith the lord god .
seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it ; and they shall consecrate themselves .
seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin offering : they shall also prepare a young bullock , and a ram out of the flock , without blemish .
and the lord did according to the word of moses ; and the frogs died out of the houses , out of the villages , and out of the fields .
and they gathered them together upon heaps : and the land stank .
and the frogs shall depart from thee , and from thy houses , and from thy servants , and from thy people ; they shall remain in the river only .
and moses and aaron went out from pharaoh : and moses cried unto the lord because of the frogs which he had brought against pharaoh .
and he said , to morrow . and he said , be it according to thy word : that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the lord our god .
then the magicians said unto pharaoh , this is the finger of god : and pharaoh ' s heart was hardened , and he hearkened not unto them ; as the lord had said .
and the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice , but they could not : so there were lice upon man , and upon beast .
but when pharaoh saw that there was respite , he hardened his heart , and hearkened not unto them ; as the lord had said .
and the lord said unto moses , say unto aaron , stretch out thy rod , and smite the dust of the land , that it may become lice throughout all the land of egypt .
and i will sever in that day the land of goshen , in which my people dwell , that no swarms of flies shall be there ; to the end thou mayest know that i am the lord in the midst of the earth .
and i will put a division between my people and thy people : to morrow shall this sign be .
and the lord did so ; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of pharaoh , and into his servants ' houses , and into all the land of egypt : the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies .
and pharaoh called for moses and for aaron , and said , go ye , sacrifice to your god in the land .
and saul said unto michal , why hast thou deceived me so , and sent away mine enemy , that he is escaped ? and michal answered saul , he said unto me , let me go ; why should i kill thee ?
and when the messengers were come in , behold , there was an image in the bed , with a pillow of goats ' hair for his bolster .
and it was told saul , saying , behold , david is at naioth in ramah .
and the lord said unto moses , rise up early in the morning , and stand before pharaoh ; lo , he cometh forth to the water ; and say unto him , thus saith the lord , let my people go , that they may serve me .
so david fled , and escaped , and came to samuel to ramah , and told him all that saul had done to him . and he and samuel went and dwelt in naioth .
else , if thou wilt not let my people go , behold , i will send swarms of flies upon thee , and upon thy servants , and upon thy people , and into thy houses : and the houses of the egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies , and also the ground whereon they are .
and in the same house remain , eating and drinking such things as they give : for the labourer is worthy of his hire . go not from house to house .
wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was , and her two daughters in law with her ; and they went on the way to return unto the land of judah .
and moses said , it is not meet so to do ; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the egyptians to the lord our god : lo , shall we sacrifice the abomination of the egyptians before their eyes , and will they not stone us ?
and into whatsoever city ye enter , and they receive you , eat such things as are set before you :
then she arose with her daughters in law , that she might return from the country of moab : for she had heard in the country of moab how that the lord had visited his people in giving them bread .
we will go three days ' journey into the wilderness , and sacrifice to the lord our god , as he shall command us .
the lord grant you that ye may find rest , each of you in the house of her husband . then she kissed them ; and they lifted up their voice , and wept .
and pharaoh said , i will let you go , that ye may sacrifice to the lord your god in the wilderness ; only ye shall not go very far away : intreat for me .
and naomi said unto her two daughters in law , go , return each to her mother ' s house : the lord deal kindly with you , as ye have dealt with the dead , and with me .
and moses said , behold , i go out from thee , and i will intreat the lord that the swarms of flies may depart from pharaoh , from his servants , and from his people , to morrow : but let not pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the lord .
after these things , and the establishment thereof , sennacherib king of assyria came , and entered into judah , and encamped against the fenced cities , and thought to win them for himself .
and the name of the man was elimelech , and the name of his wife naomi , and the name of his two sons mahlon and chilion , ephrathites of bethlehemjudah . and they came into the country of moab , and continued there .
and elimelech naomi ' s husband died ; and she was left , and her two sons .
he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city : and they did help him .
and they took them wives of the women of moab ; the name of the one was orpah , and the name of the other ruth : and they dwelled there about ten years .
and when hezekiah saw that sennacherib was come , and that he was purposed to fight against jerusalem ,
and mahlon and chilion died also both of them ; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband .
now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled , that there was a famine in the land . and a certain man of bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of moab , he , and his wife , and his two sons .
after this did sennacherib king of assyria send his servants to jerusalem , ( but he himself laid siege against lachish , and all his power with him , ) unto hezekiah king of judah , and unto all judah that were at jerusalem , saying ,
so michal let david down through a window : and he went , and fled , and escaped .
i know that the lord will maintain the cause of the afflicted , and the right of the poor .
with him is an arm of flesh ; but with us is the lord our god to help us , and to fight our battles . and the people rested themselves upon the words of hezekiah king of judah .
and michal took an image , and laid it in the bed , and put a pillow of goats ' hair for his bolster , and covered it with a cloth .
and when saul sent messengers to take david , she said , he is sick .
let burning coals fall upon them : let them be cast into the fire ; into deep pits , that they rise not up again .
and saul sent the messengers again to see david , saying , bring him up to me in the bed , that i may slay him .
also he strengthened himself , and built up all the wall that was broken , and raised it up to the towers , and another wall without , and repaired millo in the city of david , and made darts and shields in abundance .
so there was gathered much people together , who stopped all the fountains , and the brook that ran through the midst of the land , saying , why should the kings of assyria come , and find much water ?
be strong and courageous , be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of assyria , nor for all the multitude that is with him : for there be more with us than with him :
and saul sought to smite david even to the wall with the javelin ; but he slipped away out of saul ' s presence , and he smote the javelin into the wall : and david fled , and escaped that night .
saul also sent messengers unto david ' s house , to watch him , and to slay him in the morning : and michal david ' s wife told him , saying , if thou save not thy life to night , to morrow thou shalt be slain .
as we have therefore opportunity , let us do good unto all men , especially unto them who are of the household of faith .
therefore said he unto them , the harvest truly is great , but the labourers are few : pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest , that he would send forth labourers into his harvest .
there shall no evil befall thee , neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling .
after these things the lord appointed other seventy also , and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place , whither he himself would come .
they shall bear thee up in their hands , lest thou dash thy foot against a stone .
for he shall give his angels charge over thee , to keep thee in all thy ways .
and if the son of peace be there , your peace shall rest upon it : if not , it shall turn to you again .
because he hath set his love upon me , therefore will i deliver him : i will set him on high , because he hath known my name .
and into whatsoever house ye enter , first say , peace be to this house .
thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder : the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet .
carry neither purse , nor scrip , nor shoes : and salute no man by the way .
with long life will i satisfy him , and shew him my salvation .
go your ways : behold , i send you forth as lambs among wolves .
he shall call upon me , and i will answer him : i will be with him in trouble ; i will deliver him , and honour him .
and when it was told saul , he sent other messengers , and they prophesied likewise . and saul sent messengers again the third time , and they prophesied also .
then went he also to ramah , and came to a great well that is in sechu : and he asked and said , where are samuel and david ? and one said , behold , they be at naioth in ramah .
and saul sent messengers to take david : and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying , and samuel standing as appointed over them , the spirit of god was upon the messengers of saul , and they also prophesied .
and he went thither to naioth in ramah : and the spirit of god was upon him also , and he went on , and prophesied , until he came to naioth in ramah .
and he stripped off his clothes also , and prophesied before samuel in like manner , and lay down naked all that day and all that night . wherefore they say , is saul also among the prophets ?
as many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh , they constrain you to be circumcised ; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of christ .
ye see how large a letter i have written unto you with mine own hand .
but god forbid that i should glory , save in the cross of our lord jesus christ , by whom the world is crucified unto me , and i unto the world .
for neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law ; but desire to have you circumcised , that they may glory in your flesh .
and as many as walk according to this rule , peace be on them , and mercy , and upon the israel of god .
for in christ jesus neither circumcision availeth anything , nor uncircumcision , but a new creature .
brethren , the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit . amen .
from henceforth let no man trouble me : for i bear in my body the marks of the lord jesus .
the horims also dwelt in seir beforetime ; but the children of esau succeeded them , when they had destroyed them from before them , and dwelt in their stead ; as israel did unto the land of his possession , which the lord gave unto them .
which also were accounted giants , as the anakims ; but the moabites call them emims .
the emims dwelt therein in times past , a people great , and many , and tall , as the anakims ;
so it came to pass , when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people ,
for indeed the hand of the lord was against them , to destroy them from among the host , until they were consumed .
and the space in which we came from kadesh - barnea , until we were come over the brook zered , was thirty and eight years ; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host , as the lord sware unto them .
now rise up , said i , and get you over the brook zered . and we went over the brook zered .
and when thou comest nigh over against the children of ammon , distress them not , nor meddle with them : for i will not give thee of the land of the children of ammon any possession ; because i have given it unto the children of lot for a possession .
thou art to pass over through ar , the coast of moab , this day :
that the lord spake unto me , saying ,
then said his wife unto him , dost thou still retain thine integrity ? curse god , and die .
again there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord , and satan came also among them to present himself before the lord .
and the lord said unto satan , from whence comest thou ? and satan answered the lord , and said , from going to and fro in the earth , and from walking up and down in it .
and satan answered the lord , and said , skin for skin , yea , all that a man hath will he give for his life .
but put forth thine hand now , and touch his bone and his flesh , and he will curse thee to thy face .
and the lord said unto satan , behold , he is in thine hand ; but save his life .
so went satan forth from the presence of the lord , and smote job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown .
and he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal ; and he sat down among the ashes .
now , thou son of man , wilt thou judge , wilt thou judge the bloody city ? yea , thou shalt shew her all her abominations .
then say thou , thus saith the lord god , the city sheddeth blood in the midst of it , that her time may come , and maketh idols against herself to defile herself .
moreover the word of the lord came unto me , saying ,
in thee have they set light by father and mother : in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger : in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow .
behold , the princes of israel , every one were in thee to their power to shed blood .
those that be near , and those that be far from thee , shall mock thee , which art infamous and much vexed .
thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed ; and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made ; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near , and art come even unto thy years : therefore have i made thee a reproach unto the heathen , and a mocking to all countries .
and the word of the lord came unto jonah the second time , saying ,
in thee are men that carry tales to shed blood : and in thee they eat upon the mountains : in the midst of thee they commit lewdness .
so jonah arose , and went unto nineveh , according to the word of the lord . now nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days ' journey .
thou hast despised mine holy things , and hast profaned my sabbaths .
arise , go unto nineveh , that great city , and preach unto it the preaching that i bid thee .
so the people of nineveh believed god , and proclaimed a fast , and put on sackcloth , from the greatest of them even to the least of them .
and jonah began to enter into the city a day ' s journey , and he cried , and said , yet forty days , and nineveh shall be overthrown .
and he caused it to be proclaimed and published through nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles , saying , let neither man nor beast , herd nor flock , taste any thing : let them not feed , nor drink water :
for word came unto the king of nineveh , and he arose from his throne , and he laid his robe from him , and covered him with sackcloth , and sat in ashes .
who can tell if god will turn and repent , and turn away from his fierce anger , that we perish not ?
but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth , and cry mightily unto god : yea , let them turn every one from his evil way , and from the violence that is in their hands .
only unto the land of the children of ammon thou camest not , nor unto any place of the river jabbok , nor unto the cities in the mountains , nor unto whatsoever the lord our god forbad us .
from aroer , which is by the brink of the river of arnon , and from the city that is by the river , even unto gilead , there was not one city too strong for us : the lord our god delivered all unto us :
only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves , and the spoil of the cities which we took .
and we took all his cities at that time , and utterly destroyed the men , and the women , and the little ones , of every city , we left none to remain :
and the lord our god delivered him before us ; and we smote him , and his sons , and all his people .
then sihon came out against us , he and all his people , to fight at jahaz .
and the lord said unto me , behold , i have begun to give sihon and his land before thee : begin to possess , that thou mayest inherit his land .
and pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also , neither would he let the people go .
and the lord did according to the word of moses ; and he removed the swarms of flies from pharaoh , from his servants , and from his people ; there remained not one .
and moses went out from pharaoh , and intreated the lord .
for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise , and god did rest the seventh day from all his works .
for we which have believed do enter into rest , as he said , as i have sworn in my wrath , if they shall enter into my rest : although the works were finished from the foundation of the world .
seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein , and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief :
and in this place again , if they shall enter into my rest .
for unto us was the gospel preached , as well as unto them : but the word preached did not profit them , not being mixed with faith in them that heard it .
and at this house , which is high , every one that passeth by it shall be astonished , and shall hiss ; and they shall say , why hath the lord done thus unto this land , and to this house ?
let us therefore fear , lest , a promise being left us of entering into his rest , any of you should seem to come short of it .
and they shall answer , because they forsook the lord their god , who brought forth their fathers out of the land of egypt , and have taken hold upon other gods , and have worshipped them , and served them : therefore hath the lord brought upon them all this evil .
but if ye shall at all turn from following me , ye or your children , and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which i have set before you , but go and serve other gods , and worship them :
then will i cut off israel out of the land which i have given them ; and this house , which i have hallowed for my name , will i cast out of my sight ; and israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people :
and if thou wilt walk before me , as david thy father walked , in integrity of heart , and in uprightness , to do according to all that i have commanded thee , and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments :
then i will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon israel for ever , as i promised to david thy father , saying , there shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of israel .
for if jesus had given them rest , then would he not afterward have spoken of another day .
that the lord appeared to solomon the second time , as he had appeared unto him at gibeon .
again , he limiteth a certain day , saying in david , to day , after so long a time ; as it is said , to day if ye will hear his voice , harden not your hearts .
and the lord said unto him , i have heard thy prayer and thy supplication , that thou hast made before me : i have hallowed this house , which thou hast built , to put my name there for ever ; and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually .
there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of god .
and it came to pass , when solomon had finished the building of the house of the lord , and the king ' s house , and all solomon ' s desire which he was pleased to do ,
this day will i begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven , who shall hear report of thee , and shall tremble , and be in anguish because of thee .
rise ye up , take your journey , and pass over the river arnon : behold , i have given into thine hand sihon the amorite , king of heshbon , and his land : begin to possess it , and contend with him in battle .
let me pass through thy land : i will go along by the high way , i will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left .
and i sent messengers out of the wilderness of kedemoth unto sihon king of heshbon with words of peace , saying ,
a people great , and many , and tall , as the anakims ; but the lord destroyed them before them ; and they succeeded them , and dwelt in their stead :
and the avims which dwelt in hazerim , even unto azzah , the caphtorims , which came forth out of caphtor , destroyed them , and dwelt in their stead . )
as he did to the children of esau , which dwelt in seir , when he destroyed the horims from before them ; and they succeeded them , and dwelt in their stead even unto this day :
( as the children of esau which dwell in seir , and the moabites which dwell in ar , did unto me ; ) until i shall pass over jordan into the land which the lord our god giveth us .
thou shalt sell me meat for money , that i may eat ; and give me water for money , that i may drink : only i will pass through on my feet ;
but sihon king of heshbon would not let us pass by him : for the lord thy god hardened his spirit , and made his heart obstinate , that he might deliver him into thy hand , as appeareth this day .
judge not , and ye shall not be judged : condemn not , and ye shall not be condemned : forgive , and ye shall be forgiven :
give , and it shall be given unto you ; good measure , pressed down , and shaken together , and running over , shall men give into your bosom . for with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again .
and he spake a parable unto them , can the blind lead the blind ? shall they not both fall into the ditch ?
and if ye do good to them which do good to you , what thank have ye ? for sinners also do even the same .
and if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive , what thank have ye ? for sinners also lend to sinners , to receive as much again .
but love ye your enemies , and do good , and lend , hoping for nothing again ; and your reward shall be great , and ye shall be the children of the highest : for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil .
be ye therefore merciful , as your father also is merciful .
for thus saith the lord to the men of judah and jerusalem , break up your fallow ground , and sow not among thorns .
if thou shalt do this thing , and god command thee so , then thou shalt be able to endure , and all this people shall also go to their place in peace .
circumcise yourselves to the lord , and take away the foreskins of your heart , ye men of judah and inhabitants of jerusalem : lest my fury come forth like fire , and burn that none can quench it , because of the evil of your doings .
for if ye love them which love you , what thank have ye ? for sinners also love those that love them .
and let them judge the people at all seasons : and it shall be , that every great matter they shall bring unto thee , but every small matter they shall judge : so shall it be easier for thyself , and they shall bear the burden with thee .
if thou wilt return , o israel , saith the lord , return unto me : and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight , then shalt thou not remove .
and as ye would that men should do to you , do ye also to them likewise .
moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men , such as fear god , men of truth , hating covetousness ; and place such over them , to be rulers of thousands , and rulers of hundreds , rulers of fifties , and rulers of tens :
and thou shalt swear , the lord liveth , in truth , in judgment , and in righteousness ; and the nations shall bless themselves in him , and in him shall they glory .
jesus answered , neither hath this man sinned , nor his parents : but that the works of god should be made manifest in him .
lo this , we have searched it , so it is ; hear it , and know thou it for thy good .
and his disciples asked him , saying , master , who did sin , this man , or his parents , that he was born blind ?
and moses let his father in law depart ; and he went his way into his own land .
and as jesus passed by , he saw a man which was blind from his birth .
and they judged the people at all seasons : the hard causes they brought unto moses , but every small matter they judged themselves .
thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great , and thine offspring as the grass of the earth .
and moses chose able men out of all israel , and made them heads over the people , rulers of thousands , rulers of hundreds , rulers of fifties , and rulers of tens .
and said unto him , go , wash in the pool of siloam , ( which is by interpretation , sent . ) he went his way therefore , and washed , and came seeing .
for thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field : and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee .
when he had thus spoken , he spat on the ground , and made clay of the spittle , and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay ,
at destruction and famine thou shalt laugh : neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth .
as long as i am in the world , i am the light of the world .
thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue : neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh .
and it shall come to pass at that day , saith the lord , that the heart of the king shall perish , and the heart of the princes ; and the priests shall be astonished , and the prophets shall wonder .
i must work the works of him that sent me , while it is day : the night cometh , when no man can work .
in famine he shall redeem thee from death : and in war from the power of the sword .
and thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws , and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk , and the work that they must do .
the lion is come up from his thicket , and the destroyer of the gentiles is on his way ; he is gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate ; and thy cities shall be laid waste , without an inhabitant .
for this gird you with sackcloth , lament and howl : for the fierce anger of the lord is not turned back from us .
some said , this is he : others said , he is like him : but he said , i am he .
declare ye in judah , and publish in jerusalem ; and say , blow ye the trumpet in the land : cry , gather together , and say , assemble yourselves , and let us go into the defenced cities .
the neighbours therefore , and they which before had seen him that he was blind , said , is not this he that sat and begged ?
set up the standard toward zion : retire , stay not : for i will bring evil from the north , and a great destruction .
bless them that curse you , and pray for them which despitefully use you .
thou wilt surely wear away , both thou , and this people that is with thee : for this thing is too heavy for thee ; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone .
and unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other ; and him that taketh away thy cloke forbid not to take thy coat also .
woe unto you , when all men shall speak well of you ! for so did their fathers to the false prophets .
but i say unto you which hear , love your enemies , do good to them which hate you ,
but woe unto you that are rich ! for ye have received your consolation .
woe unto you that are full ! for ye shall hunger . woe unto you that laugh now ! for ye shall mourn and weep .
blessed are ye , when men shall hate you , and when they shall separate you from their company , and shall reproach you , and cast out your name as evil , for the son of man ' s sake .
rejoice ye in that day , and leap for joy : for , behold , your reward is great in heaven : for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets .
blessed are ye that hunger now : for ye shall be filled . blessed are ye that weep now : for ye shall laugh .
now i know that the lord is greater than all gods : for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them .
and he lifted up his eyes on his disciples , and said , blessed be ye poor : for yours is the kingdom of god .
and jethro said , blessed be the lord , who hath delivered you out of the hand of the egyptians , and out of the hand of pharaoh , who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the egyptians .
and it came to pass on the morrow , that moses sat to judge the people : and the people stood by moses from the morning unto the evening .
and moses said unto his father in law , because the people come unto me to inquire of god :
and when moses ' father in law saw all that he did to the people , he said , what is this thing that thou doest to the people ? why sittest thou thyself alone , and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even ?
and moses ' father in law said unto him , the thing that thou doest is not good .
when they have a matter , they come unto me ; and i judge between one and another , and i do make them know the statutes of god , and his laws .
and this is the number of them : thirty chargers of gold , a thousand chargers of silver , nine and twenty knives ,
also cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the lord , which nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of jerusalem , and had put them in the house of his gods ;
and all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver , with gold , with goods , and with beasts , and with precious things , beside all that was willingly offered .
then rose up the chief of the fathers of judah and benjamin , and the priests , and the levites , with all them whose spirit god had raised , to go up to build the house of the lord which is in jerusalem .
and whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth , let the men of his place help him with silver , and with gold , and with goods , and with beasts , beside the freewill offering for the house of god that is in jerusalem .
we have dealt very corruptly against thee , and have not kept the commandments , nor the statutes , nor the judgments , which thou commandedst thy servant moses .
who is there among you of all his people ? his god be with him , and let him go up to jerusalem , which is in judah , and build the house of the lord god of israel , ( he is the god , ) which is in jerusalem .
remember , i beseech thee , the word that thou commandedst thy servant moses , saying , if ye transgress , i will scatter you abroad among the nations :
thus saith cyrus king of persia , the lord god of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth ; and he hath charged me to build him an house at jerusalem , which is in judah .
but if ye turn unto me , and keep my commandments , and do them ; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven , yet will i gather them from thence , and will bring them unto the place that i have chosen to set my name there .
now in the first year of cyrus king of persia , that the word of the lord by the mouth of jeremiah might be fulfilled , the lord stirred up the spirit of cyrus king of persia , that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom , and put it also in writing , saying ,
and they departed from rithmah , and pitched at rimmon - parez .
and they departed from hazeroth , and pitched in rithmah .
and they went from kehelathah , and pitched in mount shapher .
and they journeyed from rissah , and pitched in kehelathah .
and there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of jesse , and a branch shall grow out of his roots :
and they departed from rimmon - parez , and pitched in libnah .
and the spirit of the lord shall rest upon him , the spirit of wisdom and understanding , the spirit of counsel and might , the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the lord ;
and they departed from tahath , and pitched at tarah .
and they removed from makheloth , and encamped at tahath .
and they removed from haradah , and pitched in makheloth .
and they removed from mount shapher , and encamped in haradah .
and they said unto me , the remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach : the wall of jerusalem also is broken down , and the gates thereof are burned with fire .
and the cow and the bear shall feed ; their young ones shall lie down together : and the lion shall eat straw like the ox .
that hanani , one of my brethren , came , he and certain men of judah ; and i asked them concerning the jews that had escaped , which were left of the captivity , and concerning jerusalem .
and the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp , and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice ' den .
and said , i beseech thee , o lord god of heaven , the great and terrible god , that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments :
they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain : for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the lord , as the waters cover the sea .
and it came to pass , when i heard these words , that i sat down and wept , and mourned certain days , and fasted , and prayed before the god of heaven ,
and shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the lord : and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes , neither reprove after the hearing of his ears :
but with righteousness shall he judge the poor , and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth : and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth , and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked .
the words of nehemiah the son of hachaliah . and it came to pass in the month chisleu , in the twentieth year , as i was in shushan the palace ,
and righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins , and faithfulness the girdle of his reins .
and why call ye me , lord , lord , and do not the things which i say ?
whosoever cometh to me , and heareth my sayings , and doeth them , i will shew you to whom he is like :
for every tree is known by his own fruit . for of thorns men do not gather figs , nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes .
a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good ; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil : for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh .
he is like a man which built an house , and digged deep , and laid the foundation on a rock : and when the flood arose , the stream beat vehemently upon that house , and could not shake it : for it was founded upon a rock .
but he that heareth , and doeth not , is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth ; against which the stream did beat vehemently , and immediately it fell ; and the ruin of that house was great .
and they removed from elim , and encamped by the red sea .
he taketh the wise in their own craftiness : and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong .
and they took their journey out of the wilderness of sin , and encamped in dophkah .
so the poor hath hope , and iniquity stoppeth her mouth .
and they removed from the red sea , and encamped in the wilderness of sin .
but he saveth the poor from the sword , from their mouth , and from the hand of the mighty .
for a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit ; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit .
and they removed from alush , and encamped at rephidim , where was no water for the people to drink .
for he maketh sore , and bindeth up : he woundeth , and his hands make whole .
and they departed from dophkah , and encamped in alush .
behold , happy is the man whom god correcteth : therefore despise not thou the chastening of the almighty :
and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother ' s eye , but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye ?
and they removed from the desert of sinai , and pitched at kibroth - hattaavah .
the disciple is not above his master : but every one that is perfect shall be as his master .
and they departed from rephidim , and pitched in the wilderness of sinai .
he shall deliver thee in six troubles : yea , in seven there shall no evil touch thee .
who giveth rain upon the earth , and sendeth waters upon the fields :
he disappointeth the devices of the crafty , so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise .
to set up on high those that be low ; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety .
and aaron was an hundred and twenty and three years old when he died in mount hor .
and king arad the canaanite , which dwelt in the south in the land of canaan , heard of the coming of the children of israel .
and they departed from mount hor , and pitched in zalmonah .
and they departed from the mountains of abarim , and pitched in the plains of moab by jordan near jericho .
and they pitched by jordan , from beth - jesimoth even unto abel - shittim in the plains of moab .
and they removed from dibon - gad , and encamped in almon - diblathaim .
and they removed from almon - diblathaim , and pitched in the mountains of abarim , before nebo .
and they departed from oboth , and pitched in ije - abarim , in the border of moab .
and they departed from iim , and pitched in dibon - gad .
and they departed from zalmonah , and pitched in punon .
and they departed from punon , and pitched in oboth .
but the word of the lord came to shemaiah the man of god , saying ,
and they went from mithcah , and pitched in hashmonah .
and beth - zur , and shoco , and adullam ,
and adoraim , and lachish , and azekah ,
speak unto rehoboam the son of solomon , king of judah , and to all israel in judah and benjamin , saying ,
thus saith the lord , ye shall not go up , nor fight against your brethren : return every man to his house : for this thing is done of me . and they obeyed the words of the lord , and returned from going against jeroboam .
and rehoboam dwelt in jerusalem , and built cities for defence in judah .
and they departed from hashmonah , and encamped at moseroth .
and they departed from ebronah , and encamped at ezion - gaber .
and they removed from ezion - gaber , and pitched in the wilderness of zin , which is kadesh .
and they removed from kadesh , and pitched in mount hor , in the edge of the land of edom .
and aaron the priest went up into mount hor at the commandment of the lord , and died there , in the fortieth year after the children of israel were come out of the land of egypt , in the first day of the fifth month .
and they departed from moseroth , and pitched in bene - jaakan .
and they removed from bene - jaakan , and encamped at hor - hagidgad .
and they went from hor - hagidgad , and pitched in jotbathah .
and they removed from jotbathah , and encamped at ebronah .
and it came to pass in those days , that he went out into a mountain to pray , and continued all night in prayer to god .
ask ye of the lord rain in the time of the latter rain ; so the lord shall make bright clouds , and give them showers of rain , to every one grass in the field .
for the idols have spoken vanity , and the diviners have seen a lie , and have told false dreams ; they comfort in vain : therefore they went their way as a flock , they were troubled , because there was no shepherd .
simon , ( whom he also named peter , ) and andrew his brother , james and john , philip and bartholomew ,
mine anger was kindled against the shepherds , and i punished the goats : for the lord of hosts hath visited his flock the house of judah , and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle .
and when it was day , he called unto him his disciples : and of them he chose twelve , whom also he named apostles ;
out of him came forth the corner , out of him the nail , out of him the battle bow , out of him every oppressor together .
and judas the brother of james , and judas iscariot , which also was the traitor .
matthew and thomas , james the son of alphaeus , and simon called zelotes ,
and they that were vexed with unclean spirits : and they were healed .
and he came down with them , and stood in the plain , and the company of his disciples , and a great multitude of people out of all judaea and jerusalem , and from the sea coast of tyre and sidon , which came to hear him , and to be healed of their diseases ;
and i will sow them among the people : and they shall remember me in far countries ; and they shall live with their children , and turn again .
and the whole multitude sought to touch him : for there went virtue out of him , and healed them all .
and they shall be as mighty men , which tread down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle : and they shall fight , because the lord is with them , and the riders on horses shall be confounded .
and they of ephraim shall be like a mighty man , and their heart shall rejoice as through wine : yea , their children shall see it , and be glad ; their heart shall rejoice in the lord .
i will hiss for them , and gather them ; for i have redeemed them : and they shall increase as they have increased .
and looking round about upon them all , he said unto the man , stretch forth thy hand . and he did so : and his hand was restored whole as the other .
and it came to pass , as jesus sat at meat in the house , behold , many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples .
and when the pharisees saw it , they said unto his disciples , why eateth your master with publicans and sinners ?
but go ye and learn what that meaneth , i will have mercy , and not sacrifice : for i am not come to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance .
but when jesus heard that , he said unto them , they that be whole need not a physician , but they that are sick .
and jesus said unto them , can the children of the bridechamber mourn , as long as the bridegroom is with them ? but the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken from them , and then shall they fast .
then came to him the disciples of john , saying , why do we and the pharisees fast oft , but thy disciples fast not ?
neither do men put new wine into old bottles : else the bottles break , and the wine runneth out , and the bottles perish : but they put new wine into new bottles , and both are preserved .
and the lord spake unto moses in the plains of moab by jordan near jericho , saying ,
no man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment , for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment , and the rent is made worse .
speak unto the children of israel , and say unto them , when ye are passed over jordan into the land of canaan ;
and jesus arose , and followed him , and so did his disciples .
then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you , and destroy all their pictures , and destroy all their molten images , and quite pluck down all their high places :
while he spake these things unto them , behold , there came a certain ruler , and worshipped him , saying , my daughter is even now dead : but come and lay thy hand upon her , and she shall live .
and ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land , and dwell therein : for i have given you the land to possess it .
moreover it shall come to pass , that i shall do unto you , as i thought to do unto them .
i charge thee therefore before god , and the lord jesus christ , who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom ;
preach the word ; be instant in season , out of season ; reprove , rebuke , exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine .
for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine ; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers , having itching ears ;
and they shall turn away their ears from the truth , and shall be turned unto fables .
but watch thou in all things , endure afflictions , do the work of an evangelist , make full proof of thy ministry .
woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness , and his chambers by wrong ; that useth his neighbour ' s service without wages , and giveth him not for his work ;
for i am now ready to be offered , and the time of my departure is at hand .
but he shall die in the place whither they have led him captive , and shall see this land no more .
the word of the lord which came unto zephaniah the son of cushi , the son of gedaliah , the son of amariah , the son of hizkiah , in the days of josiah the son of amon , king of judah .
i have fought a good fight , i have finished my course , i have kept the faith :
shalt thou reign , because thou closest thyself in cedar ? did not thy father eat and drink , and do judgment and justice , and then it was well with him ?
that saith , i will build me a wide house and large chambers , and cutteth him out windows ; and it is cieled with cedar , and painted with vermilion .
do thy diligence to come shortly unto me :
for thus saith the lord touching shallum the son of josiah king of judah , which reigned instead of josiah his father , which went forth out of this place ; he shall not return thither any more :
weep ye not for the dead , neither bemoan him : but weep sore for him that goeth away : for he shall return no more , nor see his native country .
he judged the cause of the poor and needy ; then it was well with him : was not this to know me ? saith the lord .
what is thy beloved more than another beloved , o thou fairest among women ? what is thy beloved more than another beloved , that thou dost so charge us ?
but thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy covetousness , and for to shed innocent blood , and for oppression , and for violence , to do it .
therefore thus saith the lord concerning jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah ; they shall not lament for him , saying , ah my brother ! or , ah sister ! they shall not lament for him , saying , ah lord ! or , ah his glory !
he shall be buried with the burial of an ass , drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of jerusalem .
i rose up to open to my beloved ; and my hands dropped with myrrh , and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh , upon the handles of the lock .
i charge you , o daughters of jerusalem , if ye find my beloved , that ye tell him , that i am sick of love .
the watchmen that went about the city found me , they smote me , they wounded me ; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me .
i sleep , but my heart waketh : it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh , saying , open to me , my sister , my love , my dove , my undefiled : for my head is filled with dew , and my locks with the drops of the night .
i am come into my garden , my sister , my spouse : i have gathered my myrrh with my spice ; i have eaten my honeycomb with my honey ; i have drunk my wine with my milk : eat , o friends ; drink , yea , drink abundantly , o beloved .
i have put off my coat ; how shall i put it on ? i have washed my feet ; how shall i defile them ?
and these are the days of the years of abraham ' s life which he lived , an hundred threescore and fifteen years .
then abraham gave up the ghost , and died in a good old age , an old man , and full of years ; and was gathered to his people .
and abraham gave all that he had unto isaac .
but unto the sons of the concubines , which abraham had , abraham gave gifts , and sent them away from isaac his son , while he yet lived , eastward , unto the east country .
and jokshan begat sheba , and dedan . and the sons of dedan were asshurim , and letushim , and leummim .
and the sons of midian ; ephah , and epher , and hanoch , and abida , and eldaah . all these were the children of keturah .
then again abraham took a wife , and her name was keturah .
woe to thee that spoilest , and thou wast not spoiled ; and dealest treacherously , and they dealt not treacherously with thee ! when thou shalt cease to spoil , thou shalt be spoiled ; and when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously , they shall deal treacherously with thee .
and she bare him zimran , and jokshan , and medan , and midian , and ishbak , and shuah .
o lord , be gracious unto us ; we have waited for thee : be thou their arm every morning , our salvation also in the time of trouble .
at the noise of the tumult the people fled ; at the lifting up of thyself the nations were scattered .
and i will cast thee out , and thy mother that bare thee , into another country , where ye were not born ; and there shall ye die .
and your spoil shall be gathered like the gathering of the caterpiller : as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them .
and i will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life , and into the hand of them whose face thou fearest , even into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon , and into the hand of the chaldeans .
the lord is exalted ; for he dwelleth on high : he hath filled zion with judgment and righteousness .
as i live , saith the lord , though coniah the son of jehoiakim king of judah were the signet upon my right hand , yet would i pluck thee thence ;
and wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times , and strength of salvation : the fear of the lord is his treasure .
o inhabitant of lebanon , that makest thy nest in the cedars , how gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee , the pain as of a woman in travail !
behold , their valiant ones shall cry without : the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly .
the highways lie waste , the wayfaring man ceaseth : he hath broken the covenant , he hath despised the cities , he regardeth no man .
i spake unto thee in thy prosperity ; but thou saidst , i will not hear . this hath been thy manner from thy youth , that thou obeyedst not my voice .
and his sons isaac and ishmael buried him in the cave of machpelah , in the field of ephron the son of zohar the hittite , which is before mamre ;
the earth mourneth and languisheth : lebanon is ashamed and hewn down : sharon is like a wilderness ; and bashan and carmel shake off their fruits .
go up to lebanon , and cry ; and lift up thy voice in bashan , and cry from the passages : for all thy lovers are destroyed .
and they shall not teach every man his neighbour , and every man his brother , saying , know the lord : for all shall know me , from the least to the greatest .
now the rest of the acts of ahaziah which he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel ?
so he died according to the word of the lord which elijah had spoken . and jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of jehoram the son of jehoshaphat king of judah ; because he had no son .
o earth , earth , earth , hear the word of the lord .
behold , there came fire down from heaven , and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties : therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight .
in that he saith , a new covenant , he hath made the first old . now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away .
but to the land whereunto they desire to return , thither shall they not return .
for i will be merciful to their unrighteousness , and their sins and their iniquities will i remember no more .
and elijah answered and said unto them , if i be a man of god , let fire come down from heaven , and consume thee and thy fifty . and the fire of god came down from heaven , and consumed him and his fifty .
is this man coniah a despised broken idol ? is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure ? wherefore are they cast out , he and his seed , and are cast into a land which they know not ?
again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty . and he answered and said unto him , o man of god , thus hath the king said , come down quickly .
and elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty , if i be a man of god , then let fire come down from heaven , and consume thee and thy fifty . and there came down fire from heaven , and consumed him and his fifty .
i will consume man and beast ; i will consume the fowls of the heaven , and the fishes of the sea , and the stumblingblocks with the wicked ; and i will cut off man from off the land , saith the lord .
and when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the lord , they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets , and the levites the sons of asaph with cymbals , to praise the lord , after the ordinance of david king of israel .
i will utterly consume all things from off the land , saith the lord .
and them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops ; and them that worship and that swear by the lord , and that swear by malcham ;
i will also stretch out mine hand upon judah , and upon all the inhabitants of jerusalem ; and i will cut off the remnant of baal from this place , and the name of the chemarims with the priests ;
hold thy peace at the presence of the lord god : for the day of the lord is at hand : for the lord hath prepared a sacrifice , he hath bid his guests .
and them that are turned back from the lord ; and those that have not sought the lord , nor inquired for him .
in the same day also will i punish all those that leap on the threshold , which fill their masters ' houses with violence and deceit .
and it shall come to pass in the day of the lord ' s sacrifice , that i will punish the princes , and the king ' s children , and all such as are clothed with strange apparel .
so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people : for the people shouted with a loud shout , and the noise was heard afar off .
and they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the lord ; because he is good , for his mercy endureth for ever toward israel . and all the people shouted with a great shout , when they praised the lord , because the foundation of the house of the lord was laid .
but many of the priests and levites and chief of the fathers , who were ancient men , that had seen the first house , when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes , wept with a loud voice ; and many shouted aloud for joy :
my god will cast them away , because they did not hearken unto him : and they shall be wanderers among the nations .
ephraim is smitten , their root is dried up , they shall bear no fruit : yea , though they bring forth , yet will i slay even the beloved fruit of their womb .
all their wickedness is in gilgal : for there i hated them : for the wickedness of their doings i will drive them out of mine house , i will love them no more : all their princes are revolters .
give them , o lord : what wilt thou give ? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts .
and he took unto him all these , and divided them in the midst , and laid each piece one against another : but the birds divided he not .
ephraim , as i saw tyrus , is planted in a pleasant place : but ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer .
though they bring up their children , yet will i bereave them , that there shall not be a man left : yea , woe also to them when i depart from them !
as for ephraim , their glory shall fly away like a bird , from the birth , and from the womb , and from the conception .
i found israel like grapes in the wilderness ; i saw your fathers as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time : but they went to baal - peor , and separated themselves unto that shame ; and their abominations were according as they loved .
and it came to pass , that , when the sun went down , and it was dark , behold a smoking furnace , and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces .
but all the silver , and gold , and vessels of brass and iron , are consecrated unto the lord : they shall come into the treasury of the lord .
in the same day the lord made a covenant with abram , saying , unto thy seed have i given this land , from the river of egypt unto the great river , the river euphrates :
and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace ; thou shalt be buried in a good old age .
and he said unto abram , know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs , and shall serve them ; and they shall afflict them four hundred years ;
and it came to pass on the seventh day , that they rose early about the dawning of the day , and compassed the city after the same manner seven times : only on that day they compassed the city seven times .
and also that nation , whom they shall serve , will i judge : and afterward shall they come out with great substance .
and it came to pass at the seventh time , when the priests blew with the trumpets , joshua said unto the people , shout ; for the lord hath given you the city .
and when the fowls came down upon the carcases , abram drove them away .
and the city shall be accursed , even it , and all that are therein , to the lord : only rahab the harlot shall live , she and all that are with her in the house , because she hid the messengers that we sent .
and when the sun was going down , a deep sleep fell upon abram ; and , lo , an horror of great darkness fell upon him .
and ye , in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing , lest ye make yourselves accursed , when ye take of the accursed thing , and make the camp of israel a curse , and trouble it .
so the ark of the lord compassed the city , going about it once : and they came into the camp , and lodged in the camp .
and joshua rose early in the morning , and the priests took up the ark of the lord .
and seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams ' horns before the ark of the lord went on continually , and blew with the trumpets : and the armed men went before them ; but the rereward came after the ark of the lord , the priests going on , and blowing with the trumpets .
and the second day they compassed the city once , and returned into the camp : so they did six days .
the kenites , and the kenizzites , and the kadmonites ,
and joshua had commanded the people , saying , ye shall not shout , nor make any noise with your voice , neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth , until the day i bid you shout ; then shall ye shout .
and the amorites , and the canaanites , and the girgashites , and the jebusites .
and the hittites , and the perizzites , and the rephaims ,
that ye would walk worthy of god , who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory .
for this cause also thank we god without ceasing , because , when ye received the word of god which ye heard of us , ye received it not as the word of men , but as it is in truth , the word of god , which effectually worketh also in you that believe .
ye are witnesses , and god also , how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe :
and joshua adjured them at that time , saying , cursed be the man before the lord , that riseth up and buildeth this city jericho : he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn , and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it .
as ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you , as a father doth his children ,
so the lord was with joshua ; and his fame was noised throughout all the country .
forbidding us to speak to the gentiles that they might be saved , to fill up their sins alway : for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost .
but we , brethren , being taken from you for a short time in presence , not in heart , endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire .
for ye , brethren , became followers of the churches of god which in judaea are in christ jesus : for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen , even as they have of the jews :
who both killed the lord jesus , and their own prophets , and have persecuted us ; and they please not god , and are contrary to all men :
and they utterly destroyed all that was in the city , both man and woman , young and old , and ox , and sheep , and ass , with the edge of the sword .
wherefore we would have come unto you , even i paul , once and again ; but satan hindered us .
for what is our hope , or joy , or crown of rejoicing ? are not even ye in the presence of our lord jesus christ at his coming ?
and they burnt the city with fire , and all that was therein : only the silver , and the gold , and the vessels of brass and of iron , they put into the treasury of the house of the lord .
but joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country , go into the harlot ' s house , and bring out thence the woman , and all that she hath , as ye sware unto her .
and the young men that were spies went in , and brought rahab , and her father , and her mother , and her brethren , and all that she had ; and they brought out all her kindred , and left them without the camp of israel .
for ye are our glory and joy .
he hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone , he hath made my paths crooked .
he hath builded against me , and compassed me with gall and travail .
he hath set me in dark places , as they that be dead of old .
he hath hedged me about , that i cannot get out : he hath made my chain heavy .
also when i cry and shout , he shutteth out my prayer .
i am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath .
he hath led me , and brought me into darkness , but not into light .
surely against me is he turned ; he turneth his hand against me all the day .
my flesh and my skin hath he made old ; he hath broken my bones .
and i will do in thee that which i have not done , and whereunto i will not do any more the like , because of all thine abominations .
when my soul fainted within me i remembered the lord : and my prayer came in unto thee , into thine holy temple .
they that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy .
therefore thus saith the lord god ; because ye multiplied more than the nations that are round about you , and have not walked in my statutes , neither have kept my judgments , neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that are round about you ;
the waters compassed me about , even to the soul : the depth closed me round about , the weeds were wrapped about my head .
therefore thus saith the lord god ; behold , i , even i , am against thee , and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations .
i went down to the bottoms of the mountains ; the earth with her bars was about me for ever : yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption , o lord my god .
thus saith the lord god ; this is jerusalem : i have set it in the midst of the nations and countries that are round about her .
and she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations , and my statutes more than the countries that are round about her : for they have refused my judgments and my statutes , they have not walked in them .
thou shalt also take thereof a few in number , and bind them in thy skirts .
but i will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving ; i will pay that that i have vowed . salvation is of the lord .
then take of them again , and cast them into the midst of the fire , and burn them in the fire ; for thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of israel .
then i said , i am cast out of thy sight ; yet i will look again toward thy holy temple .
then jonah prayed unto the lord his god out of the fish ' s belly ,
and said , i cried by reason of mine affliction unto the lord , and he heard me ; out of the belly of hell cried i , and thou heardest my voice .
and jesus answered him , saying , it is written , that man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word of god .
and the devil , taking him up into an high mountain , shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time .
and thou , son of man , take thee a sharp knife , take thee a barber ' s rasor , and cause it to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard : then take thee balances to weight , and divide the hair .
being forty days tempted of the devil . and in those days he did eat nothing : and when they were ended , he afterward hungered .
and the devil said unto him , if thou be the son of god , command this stone that it be made bread .
and he brought him to jerusalem , and set him on a pinnacle of the temple , and said unto him , if thou be the son of god , cast thyself down from hence :
and the devil said unto him , all this power will i give thee , and the glory of them : for that is delivered unto me ; and to whomsoever i will i give it .
if thou therefore wilt worship me , all shall be thine .
and balaam rose up in the morning , and said unto the princes of balak , get you into your land : for the lord refuseth to give me leave to go with you .
and the princes of moab rose up , and they went unto balak , and said , balaam refuseth to come with us .
and balak sent yet again princes , more , and more honourable than they .
and they came to balaam , and said to him , thus saith balak the son of zippor , let nothing , i pray thee , hinder thee from coming unto me :
and balaam said unto god , balak the son of zippor , king of moab , hath sent unto me , saying ,
and jesus being full of the holy ghost returned from jordan , and was led by the spirit into the wilderness ,
behold , there is a people come out of egypt , which covereth the face of the earth : come now , curse me them ; peradventure i shall be able to overcome them , and drive them out .
and god said unto balaam , thou shalt not go with them ; thou shalt not curse the people : for they are blessed .
thou lovest all devouring words , o thou deceitful tongue .
thou lovest evil more than good ; and lying rather than to speak righteousness . selah .
thy tongue deviseth mischiefs ; like a sharp rasor , working deceitfully .
why boastest thou thyself in mischief , o mighty man ? the goodness of god endureth continually .
i will praise thee for ever , because thou hast done it : and i will wait on thy name ; for it is good before thy saints .
the righteous also shall see , and fear , and shall laugh at him :
god shall likewise destroy thee for ever , he shall take thee away , and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place , and root thee out of the land of the living . selah .
but i am like a green olive tree in the house of god : i trust in the mercy of god for ever and ever .
lo , this is the man that made not god his strength ; but trusted in the abundance of his riches , and strengthened himself in his wickedness .
and the ass saw the angel of the lord standing in the way , and his sword drawn in his hand : and the ass turned aside out of the way , and went into the field : and balaam smote the ass , to turn her into the way .
and god ' s anger was kindled because he went : and the angel of the lord stood in the way for an adversary against him . now he was riding upon his ass , and his two servants were with him .
and balaam rose up in the morning , and saddled his ass , and went with the princes of moab .
and god came unto balaam at night , and said unto him , if the men come to call thee , rise up , and go with them ; but yet the word which i shall say unto thee , that shalt thou do .
and when the ass saw the angel of the lord , she fell down under balaam : and balaam ' s anger was kindled , and he smote the ass with a staff .
and the angel of the lord went further , and stood in a narrow place , where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left .
and when the ass saw the angel of the lord , she thrust herself unto the wall , and crushed balaam ' s foot against the wall : and he smote her again .
but the angel of the lord stood in a path of the vineyards , a wall being on this side , and a wall on that side .
now therefore , i pray you , tarry ye also here this night , that i may know what the lord will say unto me more .
for i will promote thee unto very great honour , and i will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me : come therefore , i pray thee , curse me this people .
and balaam answered and said unto the servants of balak , if balak would give me his house full of silver and gold , i cannot go beyond the word of the lord my god , to do less or more .
if we receive the witness of men , the witness of god is greater : for this is the witness of god which he hath testified of his son .
for there are three that bear record in heaven , the father , the word , and the holy ghost : and these three are one .
and there are three that bear witness in earth , the spirit , and the water , and the blood : and these three agree in one .
who is he that overcometh the world , but he that believeth that jesus is the son of god ?
and the ass said unto balaam , am not i thine ass , upon which thou hast ridden ever since i was thine unto this day ? was i ever wont to do so unto thee ? and he said , nay .
this is he that came by water and blood , even jesus christ ; not by water only , but by water and blood . and it is the spirit that beareth witness , because the spirit is truth .
for this is the love of god , that we keep his commandments : and his commandments are not grievous .
for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world : and this is the victory that overcometh the world , even our faith .
then the lord opened the eyes of balaam , and he saw the angel of the lord standing in the way , and his sword drawn in his hand : and he bowed down his head , and fell flat on his face .
whosoever believeth that jesus is the christ is born of god : and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him .
by this we know that we love the children of god , when we love god , and keep his commandments .
and the ass saw me , and turned from me these three times : unless she had turned from me , surely now also i had slain thee , and saved her alive .
and when balak heard that balaam was come , he went out to meet him unto a city of moab , which is in the border of arnon , which is in the utmost coast .
and the angel of the lord said unto balaam , go with the men : but only the word that i shall speak unto thee , that thou shalt speak . so balaam went with the princes of balak .
and balaam said unto balak , lo , i am come unto thee : have i now any power at all to say any thing ? the word that god putteth in my mouth , that shall i speak .
and balak said unto balaam , did i not earnestly send unto thee to call thee ? wherefore camest thou not unto me ? am i not able indeed to promote thee to honour ?
and the lord opened the mouth of the ass , and she said unto balaam , what have i done unto thee , that thou hast smitten me these three times ?
and balaam said unto the ass , because thou hast mocked me : i would there were a sword in mine hand , for now would i kill thee .
and it came to pass on the morrow , that balak took balaam , and brought him up into the high places of baal , that thence he might see the utmost part of the people .
and balak offered oxen and sheep , and sent to balaam , and to the princes that were with him .
then hezekiah questioned with the priests and the levites concerning the heaps .
in the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps , and finished them in the seventh month .
and when hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps , they blessed the lord , and his people israel .
and as soon as the commandment came abroad , the children of israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn , wine , and oil , and honey , and of all the increase of the fields ; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly .
and concerning the children of israel and judah , that dwelt in the cities of judah , they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep , and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the lord their god , and laid them by heaps .
he appointed also the king ' s portion of his substance for the burnt offerings , to wit , for the morning and evening burnt offerings , and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths , and for the new moons , and for the set feasts , as it is written in the law of the lord .
moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the levites , that they might be encouraged in the law of the lord .
and hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the levites after their courses , every man according to his service , the priests and levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings , to minister , and to give thanks , and to praise in the gates of the tents of the lord .
and balaam went with balak , and they came unto kirjath - huzoth .
over the camels also was obil the ishmaelite : and over the asses was jehdeiah the meronothite :
and over the flocks was jaziz the hagerite . all these were the rulers of the substance which was king david ' s .
also jonathan david ' s uncle was a counseller , a wise man , and a scribe : and jehiel the son of hachmoni was with the king ' s sons :
and ahithophel was the king ' s counseller : and hushai the archite was the king ' s companion :
also he built altars in the house of the lord , whereof the lord had said , in jerusalem shall my name be for ever .
for he built again the high places which hezekiah his father had broken down , and he reared up altars for baalim , and made groves , and worshipped all the host of heaven , and served them .
and he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of hinnom : also he observed times , and used enchantments , and used witchcraft , and dealt with a familiar spirit , and with wizards : he wrought much evil in the sight of the lord , to provoke him to anger .
and he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the lord .
neither will i any more remove the foot of israel from out of the land which i have appointed for your fathers ; so that they will take heed to do all that i have commanded them , according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of moses .
and he set a carved image , the idol which he had made , in the house of god , of which god had said to david and to solomon his son , in this house , and in jerusalem , which i have chosen before all the tribes of israel , will i put my name for ever :
so manasseh made judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem to err , and to do worse than the heathen , whom the lord had destroyed before the children of israel .
the lord was ready to save me : therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the lord .
for isaiah had said , let them take a lump of figs , and lay it for a plaister upon the boil , and he shall recover .
hezekiah also had said , what is the sign that i shall go up to the house of the lord ?
yea , i attended unto you , and , behold , there was none of you that convinced job , or that answered his words :
behold , i waited for your words ; i gave ear to your reasons , whilst ye searched out what to say .
therefore i said , hearken to me ; i also will shew mine opinion .
when i had waited , ( for they spake not , but stood still , and answered no more ; )
mine age is departed , and is removed from me as a shepherd ' s tent : i have cut off like a weaver my life : he will cut me off with pining sickness : from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me .
they were amazed , they answered no more : they left off speaking .
i said , i shall not see the lord , even the lord , in the land of the living : i shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world .
now he hath not directed his words against me : neither will i answer him with your speeches .
i said in the cutting off of my days , i shall go to the gates of the grave : i am deprived of the residue of my years .
lest ye should say , we have found out wisdom : god thrusteth him down , not man .
o lord , by these things men live , and in all these things is the life of my spirit : so wilt thou recover me , and make me to live .
behold , my belly is as wine which hath no vent ; it is ready to burst like new bottles .
what shall i say ? he hath both spoken unto me , and himself hath done it : i shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul .
for i am full of matter , the spirit within me constraineth me .
i said , i will answer also my part , i also will shew mine opinion .
i reckoned till morning , that , as a lion , so will he break all my bones : from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me .
the living , the living , he shall praise thee , as i do this day : the father to the children shall make known thy truth .
for the grave cannot praise thee , death can not celebrate thee : they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth .
behold , for peace i had great bitterness : but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption : for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back .
and say to the land of israel , thus saith the lord ; behold , i am against thee , and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath , and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked .
seeing then that i will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked , therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north :
and the word of the lord came unto me , saying ,
son of man , set thy face toward jerusalem , and drop thy word toward the holy places , and prophesy against the land of israel ,
and the king of egypt spake to the hebrew midwives , of which the name of the one was shiphrah , and the name of the other puah :
and the egyptians made the children of israel to serve with rigour :
but the more they afflicted them , the more they multiplied and grew . and they were grieved because of the children of israel .
and they possessed his land , and the land of og king of bashan , two kings of the amorites , which were on this side jordan toward the sunrising ;
on this side jordan , in the valley over against beth - peor , in the land of sihon king of the amorites , who dwelt at heshbon , whom moses and the children of israel smote , after they were come forth out of egypt :
these are the testimonies , and the statutes , and the judgments , which moses spake unto the children of israel , after they came forth out of egypt ,
and this is the law which moses set before the children of israel :
and all the plain on this side jordan eastward , even unto the sea of the plain , under the springs of pisgah .
from aroer , which is by the bank of the river arnon , even unto mount sion , which is hermon ,
son of man , prophesy , and say , thus saith the lord ; say , a sword , a sword is sharpened , and also furbished :
again the word of the lord came unto me , saying ,
he hath not dealt so with any nation : and as for his judgments , they have not known them . praise ye the lord .
sigh therefore , thou son of man , with the breaking of thy loins ; and with bitterness sigh before their eyes .
that all flesh may know that i the lord have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath : it shall not return any more .
therefore god dealt well with the midwives : and the people multiplied , and waxed very mighty .
and pharaoh charged all his people , saying , every son that is born ye shall cast into the river , and every daughter ye shall save alive .
and it came to pass , because the midwives feared god , that he made them houses .
to drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou art , to bring thee in , to give thee their land for an inheritance , as it is this day .
and because he loved thy fathers , therefore he chose their seed after them , and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of egypt ;
know therefore this day , and consider it in thine heart , that the lord he is god in heaven above , and upon the earth beneath : there is none else .
did ever people hear the voice of god speaking out of the midst of the fire , as thou hast heard , and live ?
out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice , that he might instruct thee : and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire ; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire .
unto thee it was shewed , that thou mightest know that the lord he is god ; there is none else beside him .
and all the elders of israel came , and the priests took up the ark .
thou shalt keep therefore his statutes , and his commandments , which i command thee this day , that it may go well with thee , and with thy children after thee , and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth , which the lord thy god giveth thee , for ever .
and they brought up the ark of the lord , and the tabernacle of the congregation , and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle , even those did the priests and the levites bring up .
then moses severed three cities on this side jordan toward the sunrising ;
he sheweth his word unto jacob , his statutes and his judgments unto israel .
of zebulun , ishmaiah the son of obadiah : of naphtali , jerimoth the son of azriel :
then solomon assembled the elders of israel , and all the heads of the tribes , the chief of the fathers of the children of israel , unto king solomon in jerusalem , that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the lord out of the city of david , which is zion .
that the slayer might flee thither , which should kill his neighbour unawares , and hated him not in times past ; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live :
he sendeth out his word , and melteth them : he causeth his wind to blow , and the waters flow .
and the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse , which sword proceeded out of his mouth : and all the fowls were filled with their flesh .
of judah , elihu , one of the brethren of david : of issachar , omri the son of michael :
and all the men of israel assembled themselves unto king solomon at the feast in the month ethanim , which is the seventh month .
namely , bezer in the wilderness , in the plain country , of the reubenites ; and ramoth in gilead , of the gadites ; and golan in bashan , of the manassites .
he casteth forth his ice like morsels : who can stand before his cold ?
of the levites , hashabiah the son of kemuel : of the aaronites , zadok :
for the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark , and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above .
he giveth snow like wool : he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes .
furthermore over the tribes of israel : the ruler of the reubenites was eliezer the son of zichri : of the simeonites , shephatiah the son of maachah :
and they drew out the staves , that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle , and they were not seen without : and there they are unto this day .
he sendeth forth his commandment upon earth : his word runneth very swiftly .
the twelfth captain for the twelfth month was heldai the netophathite , of othniel : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .
and king solomon , and all the congregation of israel , that were assembled unto him , were with him before the ark , sacrificing sheep and oxen , that could not be told nor numbered for multitude .
he maketh peace in thy borders , and filleth thee with the finest of the wheat .
the eleventh captain for the eleventh month was benaiah the pirathonite , of the children of ephraim : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .
and the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the lord unto his place , into the oracle of the house , to the most holy place , even under the wings of the cherubims .
for he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates ; he hath blessed thy children within thee .
the tenth captain for the tenth month was maharai the netophathite , of the zarhites : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .
praise the lord , o jerusalem ; praise thy god , o zion .
the ninth captain for the ninth month was abiezer the anetothite , of the benjamites : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .
the lord taketh pleasure in them that fear him , in those that hope in his mercy .
the eighth captain for the eighth month was sibbecai the hushathite , of the zarhites : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .
there was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone , which moses put there at horeb , when the lord made a covenant with the children of israel , when they came out of the land of egypt .
he delighteth not in the strength of the horse : he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man .
the seventh captain for the seventh month was helez the pelonite , of the children of ephraim : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .
and he said , when ye do the office of a midwife to the hebrew women , and see them upon the stools ; if it be a son , then ye shall kill him : but if it be a daughter , then she shall live .
but the midwives feared god , and did not as the king of egypt commanded them , but saved the men children alive .
and the king of egypt called for the midwives , and said unto them , why have ye done this thing , and have saved the men children alive ?
and the midwives said unto pharaoh , because the hebrew women are not as the egyptian women ; for they are lively , and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them .
but if from thence thou shalt seek the lord thy god , thou shalt find him , if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul .
and there ye shall serve gods , the work of men ' s hands , wood and stone , which neither see , nor hear , nor eat , nor smell .
and the lord shall scatter you among the nations , and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen , whither the lord shall lead you .
when thou shalt beget children , and children ' s children , and ye shall have remained long in the land , and shall corrupt yourselves , and make a graven image , or the likeness of any thing , and shall do evil in the sight of the lord thy god , to provoke him to anger :
for the lord thy god is a consuming fire , even a jealous god .
take heed unto yourselves , lest ye forget the covenant of the lord your god , which he made with you , and make you a graven image , or the likeness of any thing , which the lord thy god hath forbidden thee .
but i must die in this land , i must not go over jordan : but ye shall go over , and possess that good land .
( for the lord thy god is a merciful god ; ) he will not forsake thee , neither destroy thee , nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them .
and over the herds that fed in sharon was shitrai the sharonite : and over the herds that were in the valleys was shaphat the son of adlai :
for ask now of the days that are past , which were before thee , since the day that god created man upon the earth , and ask from the one side of heaven unto the other , whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is , or hath been heard like it ?
when thou art in tribulation , and all these things are come upon thee , even in the latter days , if thou turn to the lord thy god , and shalt be obedient unto his voice ;
and over them that did the work of the field for tillage of the ground was ezri the son of chelub :
and over the king ' s treasures was azmaveth the son of adiel : and over the storehouses in the fields , in the cities , and in the villages , and in the castles , was jehonathan the son of uzziah :
and over the olive trees and the sycomore trees that were in the low plains was baal - hanan the gederite : and over the cellars of oil was joash :
and over the vineyards was shimei the ramathite : over the increase of the vineyards for the wine cellars was zabdi the shiphmite :
of dan , azareel the son of jeroham . these were the princes of the tribes of israel .
joab the son of zeruiah began to number , but he finished not , because there fell wrath for it against israel ; neither was the number put in the account of the chronicles of king david .
but david took not the number of them from twenty years old and under : because the lord had said he would increase israel like to the stars of the heavens .
wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them , and a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them , a leopard shall watch over their cities : every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces : because their transgressions are many , and their backslidings are increased .
how shall i pardon thee for this ? thy children have forsaken me , and sworn by them that are no gods : when i had fed them to the full , they then committed adultery , and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots ' houses .
therefore i said , surely these are poor ; they are foolish : for they know not the way of the lord , nor the judgment of their god .
i will get me unto the great men , and will speak unto them ; for they have known the way of the lord , and the judgment of their god : but these have altogether broken the yoke , and burst the bonds .
they were as fed horses in the morning : every one neighed after his neighbour ' s wife .
and though they say , the lord liveth ; surely they swear falsely .
o lord , are not thine eyes upon the truth ? thou hast stricken them , but they have not grieved ; thou hast consumed them , but they have refused to receive correction : they have made their faces harder than a rock ; they have refused to return .
run ye to and fro through the streets of jerusalem , and see now , and know , and seek in the broad places thereof , if ye can find a man , if there be any that executeth judgment , that seeketh the truth ; and i will pardon it .
and rehoboam went to shechem : for to shechem were all israel come to make him king .
and they sent and called him . so jeroboam and all israel came and spake to rehoboam , saying ,
and it came to pass , when jeroboam the son of nebat , who was in egypt , whither he had fled from the presence of solomon the king , heard it , that jeroboam returned out of egypt .
and he said unto them , come again unto me after three days . and the people departed .
thy father made our yoke grievous : now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father , and his heavy yoke that he put upon us , and we will serve thee .
and they spake unto him , saying , if thou be kind to this people , and please them , and speak good words to them , they will be thy servants for ever .
and king rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before solomon his father while he yet lived , saying , what counsel give ye me to return answer to this people ?
and he said unto them , what advice give ye that we may return answer to this people , which have spoken to me , saying , ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us ?
but he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him , and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him , that stood before him .
and said to the mountains and rocks , fall on us , and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne , and from the wrath of the lamb :
who was faithful to him that appointed him , as also moses was faithful in all his house .
for the great day of his wrath is come ; and who shall be able to stand ?
for this man was counted worthy of more glory than moses , inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house .
wherefore , holy brethren , partakers of the heavenly calling , consider the apostle and high priest of our profession , christ jesus ;
and i beheld when he had opened the sixth seal , and , lo , there was a great earthquake ; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair , and the moon became as blood ;
but christ as a son over his own house ; whose house are we , if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end .
and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth , even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs , when she is shaken of a mighty wind .
wherefore ( as the holy ghost saith , to day if ye will hear his voice ,
and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together ; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places .
for every house is builded by some man ; but he that built all things is god .
and the kings of the earth , and the great men , and the rich men , and the chief captains , and the mighty men , and every bondman , and every free man , hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains ;
and moses verily was faithful in all his house , as a servant , for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after ;
harden not your hearts , as in the provocation , in the day of temptation in the wilderness :
when your fathers tempted me , proved me , and saw my works forty years .
without me they shall bow down under the prisoners , and they shall fall under the slain . for all this his anger is not turned away , but his hand is stretched out still .
o assyrian , the rod of mine anger , and the staff in their hand is mine indignation .
i will send him against an hypocritical nation , and against the people of my wrath will i give him a charge , to take the spoil , and to take the prey , and to tread them down like the mire of the streets .
howbeit he meaneth not so , neither doth his heart think so ; but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few .
for he saith , are not my princes altogether kings ?
is not calno as carchemish ? is not hamath as arpad ? is not samaria as damascus ?
and white robes were given unto every one of them ; and it was said unto them , that they should rest yet for a little season , until their fellowservants also and their brethren , that should be killed as they were , should be fulfilled .
and they cried with a loud voice , saying , how long , o lord , holy and true , dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth ?
woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees , and that write grievousness which they have prescribed ;
to turn aside the needy from judgment , and to take away the right from the poor of my people , that widows may be their prey , and that they may rob the fatherless !
and what will ye do in the day of visitation , and in the desolation which shall come from far ? to whom will ye flee for help ? and where will ye leave your glory ?
and of the blue , and purple , and scarlet , they made cloths of service , to do service in the holy place , and made the holy garments for aaron ; as the lord commanded moses .
and the curious girdle of his ephod , that was upon it , was of the same , according to the work thereof ; of gold , blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen ; as the lord commanded moses .
and the earth shall hear the corn , and the wine , and the oil ; and they shall hear jezreel .
they made shoulderpieces for it , to couple it together : by the two edges was it coupled together .
and i will sow her unto me in the earth ; and i will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy ; and i will say to them which were not my people , thou art my people ; and they shall say , thou art my god .
i will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness : and thou shalt know the lord .
and he made the ephod of gold , blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen .
and it shall come to pass in that day , i will hear , saith the lord , i will hear the heavens , and they shall hear the earth ;
it was foursquare ; they made the breastplate double : a span was the length thereof , and a span the breadth thereof , being doubled .
and he made the breastplate of cunning work , like the work of the ephod ; of gold , blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen .
and he put them on the shoulders of the ephod , that they should be stones for a memorial to the children of israel ; as the lord commanded moses .
and they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold , graven , as signets are graven , with the names of the children of israel .
and behold , boaz came from bethlehem , and said unto the reapers , the lord be with you . and they answered him , the lord bless thee .
and she went , and came , and gleaned in the field after the reapers : and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto boaz , who was of the kindred of elimelech .
and ruth the moabitess said unto naomi , let me now go to the field , and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight i shall find grace . and she said unto her , go , my daughter .
and naomi had a kinsman of her husband ' s , a mighty man of wealth , of the family of elimelech ; and his name was boaz .
and she said , i pray you , let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves : so she came , and hath continued even from the morning until now , that she tarried a little in the house .
then said boaz unto ruth , hearest thou not , my daughter ? go not to glean in another field , neither go from hence , but abide here fast by my maidens :
then said boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers , whose damsel is this ?
and the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said , it is the moabitish damsel that came back with naomi out of the country of moab :
let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap , and go thou after them : have i not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee ? and when thou art athirst , go unto the vessels , and drink of that which the young men have drawn .
thus saith the lord , write ye this man childless , a man that shall not prosper in his days : for no man of his seed shall prosper , sitting upon the throne of david , and ruling any more in judah .
thus saith the lord my god ; feed the flock of the slaughter ;
whose possessors slay them , and hold themselves not guilty : and they that sell them say , blessed be the lord ; for i am rich : and their own shepherds pity them not .
for i will no more pity the inhabitants of the land , saith the lord : but , lo , i will deliver the men every one into his neighbour ' s hand , and into the hand of his king : and they shall smite the land , and out of their hand i will not deliver them .
and i will feed the flock of slaughter , even you , o poor of the flock . and i took unto me two staves ; the one i called beauty , and the other i called bands ; and i fed the flock .
three shepherds also i cut off in one month ; and my soul lothed them , and their soul also abhorred me .
then said i , i will not feed you : that that dieth , let it die ; and that that is to be cut off , let it be cut off ; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another .
open thy doors , o lebanon , that the fire may devour thy cedars .
howl , fir tree ; for the cedar is fallen ; because the mighty are spoiled : howl , o ye oaks of bashan ; for the forest of the vintage is come down .
there is a voice of the howling of the shepherds ; for their glory is spoiled : a voice of the roaring of young lions ; for the pride of jordan is spoiled .
seeing there be many things that increase vanity , what is man the better ?
that which hath been is named already , and it is known that it is man : neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he .
for who knoweth what is good for man in this life , all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow ? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun ?
behold , thou art fair , my love ; behold , thou art fair ; thou hast doves ' eyes within thy locks : thy hair is as a flock of goats , that appear from mount gilead .
and hiram sent in the navy his servants , shipmen that had knowledge of the sea , with the servants of solomon .
thy lips are like a thread of scarlet , and thy speech is comely : thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks .
and king solomon made a navy of ships in ezion - geber , which is beside eloth , on the shore of the red sea , in the land of edom .
thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn , which came up from the washing ; whereof every one bear twins , and none is barren among them .
thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins , which feed among the lilies .
and they came to ophir , and fetched from thence gold , four hundred and twenty talents , and brought it to king solomon .
thy neck is like the tower of david builded for an armoury , whereon there hang a thousand bucklers , all shields of mighty men .
these were the chief of the officers that were over solomon ' s work , five hundred and fifty , which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work .
thou art all fair , my love ; there is no spot in thee .
but of the children of israel did solomon make no bondmen : but they were men of war , and his servants , and his princes , and his captains , and rulers of his chariots , and his horsemen .
until the day break , and the shadows flee away , i will get me to the mountain of myrrh , and to the hill of frankincense .
and three times in a year did solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the lord , and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the lord . so he finished the house .
thou hast ravished my heart , my sister , my spouse ; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes , with one chain of thy neck .
come with me from lebanon , my spouse , with me from lebanon : look from the top of amana , from the top of shenir and hermon , from the lions ' dens , from the mountains of the leopards .
as it is written , for thy sake we are killed all the day long ; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter .
who shall separate us from the love of christ ? shall tribulation , or distress , or persecution , or famine , or nakedness , or peril , or sword ?
who is he that condemneth ? it is christ that died , yea rather , that is risen again , who is even at the right hand of god , who also maketh intercession for us .
who shall lay any thing to the charge of god ' s elect ? it is god that justifieth .
nor height , nor depth , nor any other creature , shall be able to separate us from the love of god , which is in christ jesus our lord .
for i am persuaded , that neither death , nor life , nor angels , nor principalities , nor powers , nor things present , nor things to come ,
nay , in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us .
and it came to pass , when he had been there a long time , that abimelech king of the philistines looked out at a window , and saw , and , behold , isaac was sporting with rebekah his wife .
and abimelech called isaac , and said , behold , of a surety she is thy wife : and how saidst thou , she is my sister ? and isaac said unto him , because i said , lest i die for her .
moreover whom he did predestinate , them he also called : and whom he called , them he also justified : and whom he justified , them he also glorified .
what shall we then say to these things ? if god be for us , who can be against us ?
he that spared not his own son , but delivered him up for us all , how shall he not with him also freely give us all things ?
and all the people that were left of the amorites , hittites , perizzites , hivites , and jebusites , which were not of the children of israel ,
and the lord appeared unto him , and said , go not down into egypt ; dwell in the land which i shall tell thee of :
their children that were left after them in the land , whom the children of israel also were not able utterly to destroy , upon those did solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day .
sojourn in this land , and i will be with thee , and will bless thee ; for unto thee , and unto thy seed , i will give all these countries , and i will perform the oath which i sware unto abraham thy father ;
and there was a famine in the land , beside the first famine that was in the days of abraham . and isaac went unto abimelech king of the philistines unto gerar .
and isaac dwelt in gerar :
and the men of the place asked him of his wife ; and he said , she is my sister : for he feared to say , she is my wife ; lest , said he , the men of the place should kill me for rebekah ; because she was fair to look upon .
because that abraham obeyed my voice , and kept my charge , my commandments , my statutes , and my laws .
and baalath , and tadmor in the wilderness , in the land ,
and solomon built gezer , and beth - horon the nether ,
for pharaoh king of egypt had gone up , and taken gezer , and burnt it with fire , and slain the canaanites that dwelt in the city , and given it for a present unto his daughter , solomon ' s wife .
and this is the reason of the levy which king solomon raised ; for to build the house of the lord , and his own house , and millo , and the wall of jerusalem , and hazor , and megiddo , and gezer .
and hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold .
and he said , what cities are these which thou hast given me , my brother ? and he called them the land of cabul unto this day .
and hiram came out from tyre to see the cities which solomon had given him ; and they pleased him not .
( now hiram the king of tyre had furnished solomon with cedar trees and fir trees , and with gold , according to all his desire , ) that then king solomon gave hiram twenty cities in the land of galilee .
and not only they , but ourselves also , which have the firstfruits of the spirit , even we ourselves groan within ourselves , waiting for the adoption , to wit , the redemption of our body .
for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now .
but if we hope for that we see not , then do we with patience wait for it .
for we are saved by hope : but hope that is seen is not hope : for what a man seeth , why doth he yet hope for ?
and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit , because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of god .
likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities : for we know not what we should pray for as we ought : but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered .
for whom he did foreknow , he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son , that he might be the firstborn among many brethren .
and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god , to them who are the called according to his purpose .
and all the cities of store that solomon had , and cities for his chariots , and cities for his horsemen , and that which solomon desired to build in jerusalem , and in lebanon , and in all the land of his dominion .
but when he saw the multitudes , he was moved with compassion on them , because they fainted , and were scattered abroad , as sheep having no shepherd .
because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god .
then saith he unto his disciples , the harvest truly is plenteous , but the labourers are few ;
but the pharisees said , he casteth out devils through the prince of the devils .
and jesus went about all the cities and villages , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the gospel of the kingdom , and healing every sickness and every disease among the people .
pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest , that he will send forth labourers into his harvest .
and it came to pass at the end of twenty years , when solomon had built the two houses , the house of the lord , and the king ' s house ,
and it came to pass in the morning , when the meat offering was offered , that , behold , there came water by the way of edom , and the country was filled with water .
and when they came to the camp of israel , the israelites rose up and smote the moabites , so that they fled before them : but they went forward smiting the moabites , even in their country .
and they said , this is blood : the kings are surely slain , and they have smitten one another : now therefore , moab , to the spoil .
and they rose up early in the morning , and the sun shone upon the water , and the moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood :
for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god .
and when all the moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them , they gathered all that were able to put on armour , and upward , and stood in the border .
for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us .
and if children , then heirs ; heirs of god , and joint - heirs with christ ; if so be that we suffer with him , that we may be also glorified together .
then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead , and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall . and there was great indignation against israel : and they departed from him , and returned to their own land .
the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit , that we are the children of god :
and when the king of moab saw that the battle was too sore for him , he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords , to break through even unto the king of edom : but they could not .
for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear ; but ye have received the spirit of adoption , whereby we cry , abba , father .
for as many as are led by the spirit of god , they are the sons of god .
and when the devil was cast out , the dumb spake : and the multitudes marvelled , saying , it was never so seen in israel .
for if ye live after the flesh , ye shall die : but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body , ye shall live .
as they went out , behold , they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil .
therefore , brethren , we are debtors , not to the flesh , to live after the flesh .
but they , when they were departed , spread abroad his fame in all that country .
but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you , he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you .
and their eyes were opened ; and jesus straitly charged them , saying , see that no man know it .
and when jesus came into the ruler ' s house , and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise ,
he said unto them , give place : for the maid is not dead , but sleepeth . and they laughed him to scorn .
but when the people were put forth , he went in , and took her by the hand , and the maid arose .
and if christ be in you , the body is dead because of sin ; but the spirit is life because of righteousness .
and the fame hereof went abroad into all that land .
and when jesus departed thence , two blind men followed him , crying , and saying , thou son of david , have mercy on us .
and when he was come into the house , the blind men came to him : and jesus saith unto them , believe ye that i am able to do this ? they said unto him , yea , lord .
then touched he their eyes , saying , according to your faith be it unto you .
and , behold , a woman , which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years , came behind him , and touched the hem of his garment :
but jesus turned him about , and when he saw her , he said , daughter , be of good comfort ; thy faith hath made thee whole . and the woman was made whole from that hour .
for she said within herself , if i may but touch his garment , i shall be whole .
for all the riches which god hath taken from our father , that is ours , and our children ' s : now then , whatsoever god hath said unto thee , do .
are we not counted of him strangers ? for he hath sold us , and hath quite devoured also our money .
and rachel and leah answered and said unto him , is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father ' s house ?
i am the god of bethel , where thou anointedst the pillar , and where thou vowedst a vow unto me : now arise , get thee out from this land , and return unto the land of thy kindred .
and laban went to shear his sheep : and rachel had stolen the images that were her father ' s .
and he carried away all his cattle , and all his goods which he had gotten , the cattle of his getting , which he had gotten in padan - aram , for to go to isaac his father in the land of canaan .
then jacob rose up , and set his sons and his wives upon camels ;
and he said , lift up now thine eyes , and see , all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked , speckled , and grisled : for i have seen all that laban doeth unto thee .
and the angel of god spake unto me in a dream , saying , jacob : and i said , here am i .
and her neighbours and her cousins heard how the lord had shewed great mercy upon her ; and they rejoiced with her .
and it came to pass , that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child ; and they called him zacharias , after the name of his father .
he hath holpen his servant israel , in remembrance of his mercy ;
as he spake to our fathers , to abraham , and to his seed for ever .
and mary abode with her about three months , and returned to her own house .
now elisabeth ' s full time came that she should be delivered ; and she brought forth a son .
and his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation .
he hath shewed strength with his arm ; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts .
he hath put down the mighty from their seats , and exalted them of low degree .
he hath filled the hungry with good things ; and the rich he hath sent empty away .
and his mother answered and said , not so ; but he shall be called john .
behold , a king shall reign in righteousness , and princes shall rule in judgment .
and the eyes of them that see shall not be dim , and the ears of them that hear shall hearken .
and a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind , and a covert from the tempest ; as rivers of water in a dry place , as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land .
rise up , ye women that are at ease ; hear my voice , ye careless daughters ; give ear unto my speech .
and i will betroth thee unto me for ever ; yea , i will betroth thee unto me in righteousness , and in judgment , and in lovingkindness , and in mercies .
but the liberal deviseth liberal things ; and by liberal things shall he stand .
for i will take away the names of baalim out of her mouth , and they shall no more be remembered by their name .
the vile person shall be no more called liberal , nor the churl said to be bountiful .
the heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge , and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly .
the instruments also of the churl are evil : he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words , even when the needy speaketh right .
for the vile person will speak villany , and his heart will work iniquity , to practise hypocrisy , and to utter error against the lord , to make empty the soul of the hungry , and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail .
and i will destroy her vines and her fig trees , whereof she hath said , these are my rewards that my lovers have given me : and i will make them a forest , and the beasts of the field shall eat them .
i will also cause all her mirth to cease , her feast days , her new moons , and her sabbaths , and all her solemn feasts .
and now will i discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers , and none shall deliver her out of mine hand .
and it shall be at that day , saith the lord , that thou shalt call me ishi ; and shalt call me no more baali .
and i will give her her vineyards from thence , and the valley of achor for a door of hope : and she shall sing there , as in the days of her youth , and as in the day when she came up out of the land of egypt .
and hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant david ;
therefore , behold , i will allure her , and bring her into the wilderness , and speak comfortably unto her .
and his father zacharias was filled with the holy ghost , and prophesied , saying ,
blessed be the lord god of israel ; for he hath visited and redeemed his people ,
and fear came on all that dwelt round about them : and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of judaea .
and all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts , saying , what manner of child shall this be ! and the hand of the lord was with him .
and he asked for a writing table , and wrote , saying , his name is john . and they marvelled all .
and his mouth was opened immediately , and his tongue loosed , and he spake , and praised god .
and they said unto her , there is none of thy kindred that is called by this name .
and they made signs to his father , how he would have him called .
therefore they sent the ark of god to ekron . and it came to pass , as the ark of god came to ekron , that the ekronites cried out , saying , they have brought about the ark of the god of israel to us , to slay us and our people .
that we should be saved from our enemies , and from the hand of all that hate us ;
as he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets , which have been since the world began :
and the men that died not were smitten with the emerods : and the cry of the city went up to heaven .
to perform the mercy promised to our fathers , and to remember his holy covenant ;
the oath which he sware to our father abraham ,
that he would grant unto us , that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear ,
in holiness and righteousness before him , all the days of our life .
and thou , child , shalt be called the prophet of the highest : for thou shalt go before the face of the lord to prepare his ways ;
through the tender mercy of our god ; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us ,
to give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death , to guide our feet into the way of peace .
or saith he it altogether for our sakes ? for our sakes , no doubt , this is written : that he that ploweth should plow in hope ; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope .
if we have sown unto you spiritual things , is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things ?
if others be partakers of this power over you , are not we rather ? nevertheless we have not used this power ; but suffer all things , lest we should hinder the gospel of christ .
do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple ? and they which wait at the alter are partakers with the alter ?
but i have used none of these things : neither have i written these things , that it should be so done unto me : for it were better for me to die , than that any man should make my glorying void .
and the child grew , and waxed strong in spirit , and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto israel .
for though i preach the gospel , i have nothing to glory of : for necessity is laid upon me ; yea , woe is unto me , if i preach not the gospel !
for if i do this thing willingly , i have a reward : but if against my will , a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me .
and said unto the king , let the king live for ever : why should not my countenance be sad , when the city , the place of my fathers ' sepulchres , lieth waste , and the gates thereof are consumed with fire ?
what is my reward then ? verily that , when i preach the gospel , i may make the gospel of christ without charge , that i abuse not my power in the gospel .
then the king said unto me , for what dost thou make request ? so i prayed to the god of heaven .
for though i be free from all men , yet have i made myself servant unto all , that i might gain the more .
and it came to pass in the month nisan , in the twentieth year of artaxerxes the king , that wine was before him : and i took up the wine , and gave it unto the king . now i had not been beforetime sad in his presence .
wherefore the king said unto me , why is thy countenance sad , seeing thou art not sick ? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart . then i was very sore afraid ,
then i came to the governors beyond the river , and gave them the king ' s letters . now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me .
moreover i said unto the king , if it please the king , let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river , that they may convey me over till i come into judah ;
and the king said unto me , ( the queen also sitting by him , ) for how long shall thy journey be ? and when wilt thou return ? so it pleased the king to send me ; and i set him a time .
and i said unto the king , if it please the king , and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight , that thou wouldest send me unto judah , unto the city of my fathers ' sepulchres , that i may build it .
and in every several city he put shields and spears , and made them exceeding strong , having judah and benjamin on his side .
and the priests and the levites that were in all israel resorted to him out of all their coasts .
for the levites left their suburbs and their possession , and came to judah and jerusalem : for jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest ' s office unto the lord :
and he ordained him priests for the high places , and for the devils , and for the calves which he had made .
and david , according to the saying of gad , went up as the lord commanded .
and zorah , and aijalon , and hebron , which are in judah and in benjamin fenced cities .
and gad came that day to david , and said unto him , go up , rear an altar unto the lord in the threshingfloor of araunah the jebusite .
and he fortified the strong holds , and put captains in them , and store of victual , and of oil and wine .
and david spake unto the lord when he saw the angel that smote the people , and said , lo , i have sinned , and i have done wickedly : but these sheep , what have they done ? let thine hand , i pray thee , be against me , and against my father ' s house .
and when the angel stretched out his hand upon jerusalem to destroy it , the lord repented him of the evil , and said to the angel that destroyed the people , it is enough : stay now thine hand . and the angel of the lord was by the threshingplace of araunah the jebusite .
so the lord sent a pestilence upon israel from the morning even to the time appointed : and there died of the people from dan even to beer - sheba seventy thousand men .
and david said unto gad , i am in a great strait : let us fall now into the hand of the lord ; for his mercies are great : and let me not fall into the hand of man .
go and say unto david , thus saith the lord , i offer thee three things ; choose thee one of them , that i may do it unto thee .
for when david was up in the morning , the word of the lord came unto the prophet gad , david ' s seer , saying ,
and david ' s heart smote him after that he had numbered the people . and david said unto the lord , i have sinned greatly in that i have done : and now , i beseech thee , o lord , take away the iniquity of thy servant ; for i have done very foolishly .
let the day perish wherein i was born , and the night in which it was said , there is a man child conceived .
if thou shalt afflict my daughters , or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters , no man is with us ; see , god is witness betwixt me and thee .
and job spake , and said ,
and laban said to jacob , behold this heap , and behold this pillar , which i have cast betwixt me and thee ;
after this opened job his mouth , and cursed his day .
this heap be witness , and this pillar be witness , that i will not pass over this heap to thee , and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me , for harm .
how hath the lord covered the daughter of zion with a cloud in his anger , and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of israel , and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger !
the god of abraham , and the god of nahor , the god of their father , judge betwixt us . and jacob sware by the fear of his father isaac .
lo , let that night be solitary , let no joyful voice come therein .
the lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of jacob , and hath not pitied : he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of judah ; he hath brought them down to the ground : he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof .
then jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount , and called his brethren to eat bread : and they did eat bread , and tarried all night in the mount .
as for that night , let darkness seize upon it ; let it not be joined unto the days of the year , let it not come into the number of the months .
he hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of israel : he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy , and he burned against jacob like a flaming fire , which devoureth round about .
and early in the morning laban rose up , and kissed his sons and his daughters , and blessed them : and laban departed , and returned unto his place .
let darkness and the shadow of death stain it ; let a cloud dwell upon it ; let the blackness of the day terrify it .
he hath bent his bow like an enemy : he stood with his right hand as an adversary , and slew all that were pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of zion : he poured out his fury like fire .
let that day be darkness ; let not god regard it from above , neither let the light shine upon it .
the lord was as an enemy : he hath swallowed up israel , he hath swallowed up all her palaces : he hath destroyed his strong holds , and hath increased in the daughter of judah mourning and lamentation .
and every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things . now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown ; but we an incorruptible .
and he hath violently taken away his tabernacle , as if it were of a garden : he hath destroyed his places of the assembly : the lord hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in zion , and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest .
know ye not that they which run in a race run all , but one receiveth the prize ? so run , that ye may obtain .
the lord hath cast off his altar , he hath abhorred his sanctuary , he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces ; they have made a noise in the house of the lord , as in the day of a solemn feast .
but i keep under my body , and bring it into subjection : lest that by any means , when i have preached to others , i myself should be a castaway .
the lord hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of zion : he hath stretched out a line , he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying : therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament ; they languished together .
i therefore so run , not as uncertainly ; so fight i , not as one that beateth the air :
her gates are sunk into the ground ; he hath destroyed and broken her bars : her king and her princes are among the gentiles : the law is no more ; her prophets also find no vision from the lord .
to them that are without law , as without law , ( being not without law to god , but under the law to christ , ) that i might gain them that are without law .
so they strengthened the kingdom of judah , and made rehoboam the son of solomon strong , three years : for three years they walked in the way of david and solomon .
and unto the jews i became as a jew , that i might gain the jews ; to them that are under the law , as under the law , that i might gain them that are under the law ;
and after them out of all the tribes of israel such as set their hearts to seek the lord god of israel came to jerusalem , to sacrifice unto the lord god of their fathers .
and this i do for the gospel ' s sake , that i might be partaker thereof with you .
which bare him children ; jeush , and shamariah , and zaham .
to the weak became i as weak , that i might gain the weak : i am made all things to all men , that i might by all means save some .
and rehoboam took him mahalath the daughter of jerimoth the son of david to wife , and abihail the daughter of eliab the son of jesse ;
and he dealt wisely , and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of judah and benjamin , unto every fenced city : and he gave them victual in abundance . and he desired many wives .
and rehoboam loved maachah the daughter of absalom above all his wives and his concubines : ( for he took eighteen wives , and threescore concubines ; and begat twenty and eight sons , and threescore daughters . )
and after her he took maachah the daughter of absalom ; which bare him abijah , and attai , and ziza , and shelomith .
and david built there an altar unto the lord , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings . so the lord was intreated for the land , and the plague was stayed from israel .
let them curse it that curse the day , who are ready to raise up their mourning .
let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark ; let it look for light , but have none ; neither let it see the dawning of the day :
and araunah said , wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant ? and david said , to buy the threshingfloor of thee , to build an altar unto the lord , that the plague may be stayed from the people .
and araunah looked , and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him : and araunah went out , and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground .
and araunah said unto david , let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him : behold , here be oxen for burnt sacrifice , and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood .
thus i was ; in the day the drought consumed me , and the frost by night ; and my sleep departed from mine eyes .
thus have i been twenty years in thy house ; i served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters , and six years for thy cattle : and thou hast changed my wages ten times .
now therefore come thou , let us make a covenant , i and thou ; and let it be for a witness between me and thee .
and jacob took a stone , and set it up for a pillar .
except the god of my father , the god of abraham , and the fear of isaac , had been with me , surely thou hadst sent me away now empty . god hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands , and rebuked thee yesternight .
and laban answered and said unto jacob , these daughters are my daughters , and these children are my children , and these cattle are my cattle , and all that thou seest is mine : and what can i do this day unto these my daughters , or unto their children which they have born ?
and mizpah ; for he said , the lord watch between me and thee , when we are absent one from another .
and jacob said unto his brethren , gather stones ; and they took stones , and made an heap : and they did eat there upon the heap .
and laban called it jegar - sahadutha : but jacob called it galeed .
but the lord sent out a great wind into the sea , and there was a mighty tempest in the sea , so that the ship was like to be broken .
then the mariners were afraid , and cried every man unto his god , and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea , to lighten it of them . but jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship ; and he lay , and was fast asleep .
arise , go to nineveh , that great city , and cry against it ; for their wickedness is come up before me .
but jonah rose up to flee unto tarshish from the presence of the lord , and went down to joppa ; and he found a ship going to tarshish : so he paid the fare thereof , and went down into it , to go with them unto tarshish from the presence of the lord .
now the word of the lord came unto jonah the son of amittai , saying ,
and your altars shall be desolate , and your images shall be broken : and i will cast down your slain men before your idols .
and i will lay the dead carcases of the children of israel before their idols ; and i will scatter your bones round about your altars .
son of man , set thy face toward the mountains of israel , and prophesy against them ,
yet will i leave a remnant , that ye may have some that shall escape the sword among the nations , when ye shall be scattered through the countries .
then said they unto him , tell us , we pray thee , for whose cause this evil is upon us ; what is thine occupation ? and whence comest thou ? what is thy country ? and of what people art thou ?
and he said unto them , i am an hebrew ; and i fear the lord , the god of heaven , which hath made the sea and the dry land .
in all your dwellingplaces the cities shall be laid waste , and the high places shall be desolate ; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate , and your idols may be broken and cease , and your images may be cut down , and your works may be abolished .
so the shipmaster came to him , and said unto him , what meanest thou , o sleeper ? arise , call upon thy god , if so be that god will think upon us , that we perish not .
and the slain shall fall in the midst of you , and ye shall know that i am the lord .
and they said every one to his fellow , come , and let us cast lots , that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us . so they cast lots , and the lot fell upon jonah .
and jacob answered and said to laban , because i was afraid : for i said , peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me .
with whomsoever thou findest thy gods , let him not live : before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me , and take it to thee . for jacob knew not that rachel had stolen them .
now rachel had taken the images , and put them in the camel ' s furniture , and sat upon them . and laban searched all the tent , but found them not .
and the word of the lord came unto me , saying ,
and now , though thou wouldest needs be gone , because thou sore longedst after thy father ' s house , yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods ?
that which was torn of beasts i brought not unto thee ; i bare the loss of it ; of my hand didst thou require it , whether stolen by day , or stolen by night .
and she said to her father , let it not displease my lord that i cannot rise up before thee ; for the custom of women is upon me . and he searched , but found not the images .
and jacob was wroth , and chode with laban : and jacob answered and said to laban , what is my trespass ? what is my sin , that thou hast so hotly pursued after me ?
whereas thou hast searched all my stuff , what hast thou found of all thy household stuff ? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren , that they may judge betwixt us both .
this twenty years have i been with thee ; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young , and the rams of thy flock have i not eaten .
and it was told laban on the third day that jacob was fled .
and he took his brethren with him , and pursued after him seven days ' journey ; and they overtook him in the mount gilead .
and jacob stole away unawares to laban the syrian , in that he told him not that he fled .
so he fled with all that he had ; and he rose up , and passed over the river , and set his face toward the mount gilead .
and hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters ? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing .
it is in the power of my hand to do you hurt : but the god of your father spake unto me yesternight , saying , take thou heed that thou speak not to jacob either good or bad .
and laban said to jacob , what hast thou done , that thou hast stolen away unawares to me , and carried away my daughters , as captives taken with the sword ?
wherefore didst thou flee away secretly , and steal away from me ; and didst not tell me , that i might have sent thee away with mirth , and with songs , with tabret , and with harp ?
and god came to laban the syrian in a dream by night , and said unto him , take heed that thou speak not to jacob either good or bad .
then laban overtook jacob . now jacob had pitched his tent in the mount : and laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of gilead .
purge me with hyssop , and i shall be clean : wash me , and i shall be whiter than snow .
behold , thou desirest truth in the inward parts : and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom .
hide thy face from my sins , and blot out all mine iniquities .
make me to hear joy and gladness ; that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice .
and now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees : every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast into the fire .
bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance , and begin not to say within yourselves , we have abraham to our father : for i say unto you , that god is able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham .
then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him , o generation of vipers , who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
and all flesh shall see the salvation of god .
every valley shall be filled , and every mountain and hill shall be brought low ; and the crooked shall be made straight , and the rough ways shall be made smooth ;
as it is written in the book of the words of esaias the prophet , saying , the voice of one crying in the wilderness , prepare ye the way of the lord , make his paths straight .
and he came into all the country about jordan , preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins ;
now in the fifteenth year of the reign of tiberius caesar , pontius pilate being governor of judaea , and herod being tetrarch of galilee , and his brother philip tetrarch of ituraea and of the region of trachonitis , and lysanias the tetrarch of abilene ,
annas and caiaphas being the high priests , the word of god came unto john the son of zacharias in the wilderness .
against thee , thee only , have i sinned , and done this evil in thy sight : that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest , and be clear when thou judgest .
behold , i was shapen in iniquity ; and in sin did my mother conceive me .
wash me throughly from mine iniquity , and cleanse me from my sin .
for i acknowledge my transgressions : and my sin is ever before me .
have mercy upon me , o god , according to thy lovingkindness : according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions .
and he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it ; the horns thereof were of the same : and he overlaid it with brass .
and he made the altar of burnt offering of shittim wood : five cubits was the length thereof , and five cubits the breadth thereof ; it was foursquare ; and three cubits the height thereof .
and he made the court : on the south side southward the hangings of the court were of fine twined linen , an hundred cubits :
and he made the laver of brass , and the foot of it of brass , of the lookingglasses of the women assembling , which assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
and he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar , to bear it withal ; he made the altar hollow with boards .
and he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of brass , to be places for the staves .
and he made for the altar a brasen grate of network under the compass thereof beneath unto the midst of it .
and he made all the vessels of the altar , the pots , and the shovels , and the basons , and the fleshhooks , and the firepans : all the vessels thereof made he of brass .
gather yourselves together , and hear , ye sons of jacob ; and hearken unto israel your father .
and jacob called unto his sons , and said , gather yourselves together , that i may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days .
o my soul , come not thou into their secret ; unto their assembly , mine honour , be not thou united : for in their anger they slew a man , and in their selfwill they digged down a wall .
simeon and levi are brethren ; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations .
reuben , thou art my firstborn , my might , and the beginning of my strength , the excellency of dignity , and the excellency of power :
judah is a lion ' s whelp : from the prey , my son , thou art gone up : he stooped down , he couched as a lion , and as an old lion ; who shall rouse him up ?
judah , thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise : thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies ; thy father ' s children shall bow down before thee .
the lord also shall save the tents of judah first , that the glory of the house of david and the glory of the inhabitants of jerusalem do not magnify themselves against judah .
in that day shall the lord defend the inhabitants of jerusalem ; and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as david ; and the house of david shall be as god , as the angel of the lord before them .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that i will seek to destroy all the nations that come against jerusalem .
and in that day will i make jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people : all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces , though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it .
in that day , saith the lord , i will smite every horse with astonishment , and his rider with madness : and i will open mine eyes upon the house of judah , and will smite every horse of the people with blindness .
and the governors of judah shall say in their heart , the inhabitants of jerusalem shall be my strength in the lord of hosts their god .
the burden of the word of the lord for israel , saith the lord , which stretcheth forth the heavens , and layeth the foundation of the earth , and formeth the spirit of man within him .
behold , i will make jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about , when they shall be in the siege both against judah and against jerusalem .
and judah said , what shall we say unto my lord ? what shall we speak ? or how shall we clear ourselves ? god hath found out the iniquity of thy servants : behold , we are my lord ' s servants , both we , and he also with whom the cup is found .
and joseph said unto them , what deed is this that ye have done ? wot ye not that such a man as i can certainly divine ?
then judah came near unto him , and said , oh my lord , let thy servant , i pray thee , speak a word in my lord ' s ears , and let not thine anger burn against thy servant : for thou art even as pharaoh .
my lord asked his servants , saying , have ye a father , or a brother ?
and he said , now also let it be according unto your words ; he with whom it is found shall be my servant ; and ye shall be blameless .
and he searched , and began at the eldest , and left at the youngest : and the cup was found in benjamin ' s sack .
then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground , and opened every man his sack .
and judah and his brethren came to joseph ' s house ; for he was yet there : and they fell before him on the ground .
then they rent their clothes , and laded every man his ass , and returned to the city .
but he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of god .
but i will forewarn you whom ye shall fear : fear him , which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell ; yea , i say unto you , fear him .
are not five sparrows sold for two farthings , and not one of them is forgotten before god ?
but even the very hairs of your head are all numbered . fear not therefore : ye are of more value than many sparrows .
also i say unto you , whosoever shall confess me before men , him shall the son of man also confess before the angels of god :
sound speech , that cannot be condemned ; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed , having no evil thing to say of you .
in all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works : in doctrine shewing uncorruptness , gravity , sincerity ,
exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters , and to please them well in all things ; not answering again ;
and if ye take this also from me , and mischief befall him , ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave .
and the one went out from me , and i said , surely he is torn in pieces ; and i saw him not since :
and thy servant my father said unto us , ye know that my wife bare me two sons :
and we said , we cannot go down : if our youngest brother be with us , then will we go down : for we may not see the man ' s face , except our youngest brother be with us .
and the chief of all the people , even of all the tribes of israel , presented themselves in the assembly of the people of god , four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword .
and thou saidst unto thy servants , bring him down unto me , that i may set mine eyes upon him .
and a basket of unleavened bread , cakes of fine flour mingled with oil , and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil , and their meat offering , and their drink offerings .
then all the children of israel went out , and the congregation was gathered together as one man , from dan even to beer - sheba , with the land of gilead , unto the lord in mizpeh .
and we said unto my lord , we have a father , an old man , and a child of his old age , a little one ; and his brother is dead , and he alone is left of his mother , and his father loveth him .
and the priest shall bring them before the lord , and shall offer his sin offering , and his burnt offering :
and he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the lord , with the basket of unleavened bread : the priest shall offer also his meat offering , and his drink offering .
and the nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , and shall take the hair of the head of his separation , and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings .
and our father said , go again , and buy us a little food .
and the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram , and one unleavened cake out of the basket , and one unleavened wafer , and shall put them upon the hands of the nazarite , after the hair of his separation is shaven :
and it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father , we told him the words of my lord .
and thou saidst unto thy servants , except your youngest brother come down with you , ye shall see my face no more .
and we said unto my lord , the lad cannot leave his father : for if he should leave his father , his father would die .
but now this shall be the thing which we will do to gibeah ; we will go up by lot against it ;
as a fountain casteth out her waters , so she casteth out her wickedness : violence and spoil is heard in her ; before me continually is grief and wounds .
be thou instructed , o jerusalem , lest my soul depart from thee ; lest i make thee desolate , a land not inhabited .
behold , ye are all children of israel ; give here your advice and counsel .
and on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles , or two young pigeons , to the priest , to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation :
thus saith the lord of hosts , they shall throughly glean the remnant of israel as a vine : turn back thine hand as a grapegatherer into the baskets .
and all the people arose as one man , saying , we will not any of us go to his tent , neither will we any of us turn into his house .
and the men of gibeah rose against me , and beset the house round about upon me by night , and thought to have slain me : and my concubine have they forced , that she is dead .
and he shall consecrate unto the lord the days of his separation , and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering : but the days that were before shall be lost , because his separation was defiled .
the shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her ; they shall pitch their tents against her round about ; they shall feed every one in his place .
and i took my concubine , and cut her in pieces , and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of israel : for they have committed lewdness and folly in israel .
and the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering , and make an atonement for him , for that he sinned by the dead , and shall hallow his head that same day .
prepare ye war against her ; arise , and let us go up at noon . woe unto us ! for the day goeth away , for the shadows of the evening are stretched out .
( now the children of benjamin heard that the children of israel were gone up to mizpeh . ) then said the children of israel , tell us , how was this wickedness ?
and he shall offer his offering unto the lord , one he lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt offering , and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering , and one ram without blemish for peace offerings ,
arise , and let us go by night , and let us destroy her palaces .
and the levite , the husband of the woman that was slain , answered and said , i came into gibeah that belongeth to benjamin , i and my concubine , to lodge .
and this is the law of the nazarite , when the days of his separation are fulfilled : he shall be brought unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation :
for thus hath the lord of hosts said , hew ye down trees , and cast a mount against jerusalem : this is the city to be visited ; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her .
o ye children of benjamin , gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of jerusalem , and blow the trumpet in tekoa , and set up a sign of fire in beth - haccerem : for evil appeareth out of the north , and great destruction .
i have likened the daughter of zion to a comely and delicate woman .
and , hardly passing it , came unto a place which is called the fair havens ; nigh whereunto was the city of lasea .
for how shall i go up to my father , and the lad be not with me ? lest peradventure i see the evil that shall come on my father .
and when we had sailed slowly many days , and scarce were come over against cnidus , the wind not suffering us , we sailed under crete , over against salmone ;
now therefore , i pray thee , let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord ; and let the lad go up with his brethren .
and there the centurion found a ship of alexandria sailing into italy ; and he put us therein .
and when we had sailed over the sea of cilicia and pamphylia , we came to myra , a city of lycia .
and when we had launched from thence , we sailed under cyprus , because the winds were contrary .
now therefore when i come to thy servant my father , and the lad be not with us ; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad ' s life ;
and the next day we touched at sidon . and julius courteously entreated paul , and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself .
and entering into a ship of adramyttium , we launched , meaning to sail by the coasts of asia ; one aristarchus , a macedonian of thessalonica , being with us .
for thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father , saying , if i bring him not unto thee , then i shall bear the blame to my father for ever .
and when it was determined that we should sail into italy , they delivered paul and certain other prisoners unto one named julius , a centurion of augustus ' band .
it shall come to pass , when he seeth that the lad is not with us , that he will die : and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave .
and saul was very wroth , and the saying displeased him ; and he said , they have ascribed unto david ten thousands , and to me they have ascribed but thousands : and what can he have more but the kingdom ?
and saul eyed david from that day and forward .
and it came to pass as they came , when david was returned from the slaughter of the philistine , that the women came out of all cities of israel , singing and dancing , to meet king saul , with tabrets , with joy , and with instruments of musick .
and the women answered one another as they played , and said , saul hath slain his thousands , and david his ten thousands .
and jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him , and gave it to david , and his garments , even to his sword , and to his bow , and to his girdle .
and david went out whithersoever saul sent him , and behaved himself wisely : and saul set him over the men of war , and he was accepted in the sight of all the people , and also in the sight of saul ' s servants .
and saul took him that day , and would let him go no more home to his father ' s house .
then jonathan and david made a covenant , because he loved him as his own soul .
and it came to pass , when he had made an end of speaking unto saul , that the soul of jonathan was knit with the soul of david , and jonathan loved him as his own soul .
and i say unto you my friends , be not afraid of them that kill the body , and after that have no more that they can do .
therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light ; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops .
for there is nothing covered , that shall not be revealed ; neither hid , that shall not be known .
in the mean time , when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people , insomuch that they trode one upon another , he began to say unto his disciples first of all , beware ye of the leaven of the pharisees , which is hypocrisy .
hear my prayer , o god ; give ear to the words of my mouth .
save me , o god , by thy name , and judge me by thy strength .
and now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the lord in the hand of the sons of david ; and ye be a great multitude , and there are with you golden calves , which jeroboam made you for gods .
ought ye not to know that the lord god of israel gave the kingdom over israel to david for ever , even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt ?
yet jeroboam the son of nebat , the servant of solomon the son of david , is risen up , and hath rebelled against his lord .
and abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war , even four hundred thousand chosen men : jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men , being mighty men of valour .
though these three men were in it , as i live , saith the lord god , they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters , but they only shall be delivered themselves .
and abijah stood up upon mount zemaraim , which is in mount ephraim , and said , hear me , thou jeroboam , and all israel ;
or if i send a pestilence into that land , and pour out my fury upon it in blood , to cut off from it man and beast :
now in the eighteenth year of king jeroboam began abijah to reign over judah .
he reigned three years in jerusalem . his mother ' s name also was michaiah the daughter of uriel of gibeah . and there was war between abijah and jeroboam .
though these three men , noah , daniel , and job , were in it , they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness , saith the lord god .
if i cause noisome beasts to pass through the land , and they spoil it , so that it be desolate , that no man may pass through because of the beasts :
though these three men were in it , as i live , saith the lord god , they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters ; they only shall be delivered , but the land shall be desolate .
and they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity : the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that seeketh unto him ;
that the house of israel may go no more astray from me , neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions ; but that they may be my people , and i may be their god , saith the lord god .
the word of the lord came again to me , saying ,
son of man , when the land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously , then will i stretch out mine hand upon it , and will break the staff of the bread thereof , and will send famine upon it , and will cut off man and beast from it :
though noah , daniel , and job , were in it , as i live , saith the lord god , they shall deliver neither son nor daughter ; they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness .
concerning the ammonites , thus saith the lord ; hath israel no sons ? hath he no heir ? why then doth their king inherit gad , and his people dwell in his cities ?
and they shall comfort you , when ye see their ways and their doings : and ye shall know that i have not done without cause all that i have done in it , saith the lord god .
howl , o heshbon , for ai is spoiled : cry , ye daughters of rabbah , gird you with sackcloth ; lament , and run to and fro by the hedges ; for their king shall go into captivity , and his priests and his princes together .
wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys , thy flowing valley , o backsliding daughter ? that trusted in her treasures , saying , who shall come unto me ?
for thus saith the lord god ; how much more when i send my four sore judgments upon jerusalem , the sword , and the famine , and the noisome beast , and the pestilence , to cut off from it man and beast ?
behold , i will bring a fear upon thee , saith the lord god of hosts , from all those that be about thee ; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth ; and none shall gather up him that wandereth .
in judah is god known : his name is great in israel .
concerning edom , thus saith the lord of hosts ; is wisdom no more in teman ? is counsel perished from the prudent ? is their wisdom vanished ?
in salem also is his tabernacle , and his dwelling place in zion .
and afterward i will bring again the captivity of the children of ammon , saith the lord .
if grapegatherers come to thee , would they not leave some gleaning grapes ? if thieves by night , they will destroy till they have enough .
flee ye , turn back , dwell deep , o inhabitants of dedan ; for i will bring the calamity of esau upon him , the time that i will visit him .
and they shall put my name upon the children of israel ; and i will bless them .
the lord lift up his countenance upon thee , and give thee peace .
thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey .
there brake he the arrows of the bow , the shield , and the sword , and the battle . selah .
at thy rebuke , o god of jacob , both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep .
the stouthearted are spoiled , they have slept their sleep : and none of the men of might have found their hands .
thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven ; the earth feared , and was still ,
thou , even thou , art to be feared : and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry ?
when god arose to judgment , to save all the meek of the earth . selah .
the lord bless thee , and keep thee :
the lord make his face shine upon thee , and be gracious unto thee :
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
speak unto aaron and unto his sons , saying , on this wise ye shall bless the children of israel , saying unto them ,
and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the lord : this is holy for the priest , with the wave breast and heave shoulder : and after that the nazarite may drink wine .
this is the law of the nazarite who hath vowed , and of his offering unto the lord for his separation , beside that that his hand shall get : according to the vow which he vowed , so he must do after the law of his separation .
and his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch , which was of the like work . solomon made also an house for pharaoh ' s daughter , whom he had taken to wife , like unto this porch .
all these were of costly stones , according to the measures of hewed stones , sawed with saws , within and without , even from the foundation unto the coping , and so on the outside toward the great court .
and he made a porch of pillars ; the length thereof was fifty cubits , and the breadth thereof thirty cubits : and the porch was before them : and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them .
then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge , even the porch of judgment : and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other .
and there were windows in three rows , and light was against light in three ranks .
and all the doors and posts were square , with the windows : and light was against light in three ranks .
he built also the house of the forest of lebanon ; the length thereof was an hundred cubits , and the breadth thereof fifty cubits , and the height thereof thirty cubits , upon four rows of cedar pillars , with cedar beams upon the pillars .
and it was covered with cedar above upon the beams , that lay on forty five pillars , fifteen in a row .
but solomon was building his own house thirteen years , and he finished all his house .
then they brought out the king ' s son , and put upon him the crown , and gave him the testimony , and made him king . and jehoiada and his sons anointed him , and said , god save the king .
strengthen ye the weak hands , and confirm the feeble knees .
now when athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king , she came to the people into the house of the lord :
say to them that are of a fearful heart , be strong , fear not : behold , your god will come with vengeance , even god with a recompence ; he will come and save you .
the wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them ; and the desert shall rejoice , and blossom as the rose .
and he set all the people , every man having his weapon in his hand , from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple , along by the altar and the temple , by the king round about .
it shall blossom abundantly , and rejoice even with joy and singing : the glory of lebanon shall be given unto it , the excellency of carmel and sharon , they shall see the glory of the lord , and the excellency of our god .
so they laid hands on her ; and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king ' s house , they slew her there .
bring me venison , and make me savoury meat , that i may eat , and bless thee before the lord before my death .
and jehoiada made a covenant between him , and between all the people , and between the king , that they should be the lord ' s people .
now therefore , my son , obey my voice according to that which i command thee .
and an highway shall be there , and a way , and it shall be called the way of holiness ; the unclean shall not pass over it ; but it shall be for those : the wayfaring men , though fools , shall not err therein .
then the eyes of the blind shall be opened , and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped .
then shall the lame man leap as an hart , and the tongue of the dumb sing : for in the wilderness shall waters break out , and streams in the desert .
after these things were ended , paul purposed in the spirit , when he had passed through macedonia and achaia , to go to jerusalem , saying , after i have been there , i must also see rome .
now therefore take , i pray thee , thy weapons , thy quiver and thy bow , and go out to the field , and take me some venison ;
so mightily grew the word of god and prevailed .
and make me savoury meat , such as i love , and bring it to me , that i may eat ; that my soul may bless thee before i die .
and the same time there arose no small stir about that way .
and rebekah heard when isaac spake to esau his son . and esau went to the field to hunt for venison , and to bring it .
so he sent into macedonia two of them that ministered unto him , timotheus and erastus ; but he himself stayed in asia for a season .
and rebekah spake unto jacob her son , saying , behold , i heard thy father speak unto esau thy brother , saying ,
and it came to pass , that when isaac was old , and his eyes were dim , so that he could not see , he called esau his eldest son , and said unto him , my son : and he said unto him , behold , here am i .
and he said , behold now , i am old , i know not the day of my death :
and this was known to all the jews and greeks also dwelling at ephesus ; and fear fell on them all , and the name of the lord jesus was magnified .
and many that believed came , and confessed , and shewed their deeds .
then solomon began to build the house of the lord at jerusalem in mount moriah , where the lord appeared unto david his father , in the place that david had prepared in the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite .
then certain of the vagabond jews , exorcists , took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the lord jesus , saying , we adjure you by jesus whom paul preacheth .
and he began to build in the second day of the second month , in the fourth year of his reign .
and there were seven sons of one sceva , a jew , and chief of the priests , which did so .
now these are the things wherein solomon was instructed for the building of the house of god . the length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits , and the breadth twenty cubits .
and the evil spirit answered and said , jesus i know , and paul i know ; but who are ye ?
and the porch that was in the front of the house , the length of it was according to the breadth of the house , twenty cubits , and the height was an hundred and twenty : and he overlaid it within with pure gold .
and the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them , and overcame them , and prevailed against them , so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded .
and the greater house he cieled with fir tree , which he overlaid with fine gold , and set thereon palm trees and chains .
and he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty : and the gold was gold of parvaim .
and he set the porters at the gates of the house of the lord , that none which was unclean in any thing should enter in .
he overlaid also the house , the beams , the posts , and the walls thereof , and the doors thereof , with gold ; and graved cherubims on the walls .
and he made the most holy house , the length whereof was according to the breadth of the house , twenty cubits , and the breadth thereof twenty cubits : and he overlaid it with fine gold , amounting to six hundred talents .
and the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold . and he overlaid the upper chambers with gold .
no lion shall be there , nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon , it shall not be found there ; but the redeemed shall walk there :
and all the people of the land rejoiced : and the city was quiet , after that they had slain athaliah with the sword .
so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons , and the diseases departed from them , and the evil spirits went out of them .
and god wrought special miracles by the hands of paul :
and this continued by the space of two years ; so that all they which dwelt in asia heard the word of the lord jesus , both jews and greeks .
and when he had thus spoken , he dismissed the assembly .
for we are in danger to be called in question for this day ' s uproar , there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse .
and when the townclerk had appeased the people , he said , ye men of ephesus , what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess diana , and of the image which fell down from jupiter ?
the children of parosh , two thousand an hundred seventy and two .
seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against , ye ought to be quiet , and to do nothing rashly .
the children of shephatiah , three hundred seventy and two .
for ye have brought hither these men , which are neither robbers of churches , nor yet blasphemers of your goddess .
wherefore if demetrius , and the craftsmen which are with him , have a matter against any man , the law is open , and there are deputies : let them implead one another .
but if ye inquire any thing concerning other matters , it shall be determined in a lawful assembly .
that i gave my brother hanani , and hananiah the ruler of the palace , charge over jerusalem : for he was a faithful man , and feared god above many .
these are the children of the province , that went up out of the captivity , of those that had been carried away , whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon had carried away , and came again to jerusalem and to judah , every one unto his city ;
who came with zerubbabel , jeshua , nehemiah , azariah , raamiah , nahamani , mordecai , bilshan , mispereth , bigvai , nehum , baanah . the number , i say , of the men of the people of israel was this ;
and when paul would have entered in unto the people , the disciples suffered him not .
but when they knew that he was a jew , all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out , great is diana of the ephesians .
and they drew alexander out of the multitude , the jews putting him forward . and alexander beckoned with the hand , and would have made his defence unto the people .
some therefore cried one thing , and some another : for the assembly was confused ; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together .
and certain of the chief of asia , which were his friends , sent unto him , desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre .
moreover ye see and hear , that not alone at ephesus , but almost throughout all asia , this paul hath persuaded and turned away much people , saying that they be no gods , which are made with hands :
so that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought ; but also that the temple of the great goddess diana should be despised , and her magnificence should be destroyed , whom all asia and the world worshippeth .
for a certain man named demetrius , a silversmith , which made silver shrines for diana , brought no small gain unto the craftsmen ;
whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation , and said , sirs , ye know that by this craft we have our wealth .
and the whole city was filled with confusion : and having caught gaius and aristarchus , men of macedonia , paul ' s companions in travel , they rushed with one accord into the theatre .
behold , the days come , saith the lord , that i will punish all them which are circumcised with the uncircumcised ;
but let him that glorieth glory in this , that he understandeth and knoweth me , that i am the lord which exercise lovingkindness , judgment , and righteousness , in the earth : for in these things i delight , saith the lord .
thus saith the lord , let not the wise man glory in his wisdom , neither let the mighty man glory in his might , let not the rich man glory in his riches :
speak , thus saith the lord , even the carcases of men shall fall as dung upon the open field , and as the handful after the harvestman , and none shall gather them .
egypt , and judah , and edom , and the children of ammon , and moab , and all that are in the utmost corners , that dwell in the wilderness : for all these nations are uncircumcised , and all the house of israel are uncircumcised in the heart .
for death is come up into our windows , and is entered into our palaces , to cut off the children from without , and the young men from the streets .
yet hear the word of the lord , o ye women , and let your ear receive the word of his mouth , and teach your daughters wailing , and every one her neighbour lamentation .
for a voice of wailing is heard out of zion , how are we spoiled ! we are greatly confounded , because we have forsaken the land , because our dwellings have cast us out .
and it shall be , if he say unto thee , i will not go away from thee ; because he loveth thee and thine house , because he is well with thee ;
who is the wise man , that may understand this ? and who is he to whom the mouth of the lord hath spoken , that he may declare it , for what the land perisheth and is burned up like a wilderness , that none passeth through ?
and thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of egypt , and the lord thy god redeemed thee : therefore i command thee this thing to day .
and i will make jerusalem heaps , and a den of dragons ; and i will make the cities of judah desolate , without an inhabitant .
it shall not seem hard unto thee , when thou sendest him away free from thee ; for he hath been worth a double hired servant to thee , in serving thee six years : and the lord thy god shall bless thee in all that thou doest .
but have walked after the imagination of their own heart , and after baalim , which their fathers taught them :
then thou shalt take an aul , and thrust it through his ear unto the door , and he shall be thy servant for ever . and also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise .
and the lord saith , because they have forsaken my law which i set before them , and have not obeyed my voice , neither walked therein ;
i will scatter them also among the heathen , whom neither they nor their fathers have known : and i will send a sword after them , till i have consumed them .
all the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto the lord thy god : thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thy bullock , nor shear the firstling of thy sheep .
therefore thus saith the lord of hosts , the god of israel ; behold , i will feed them , even this people , with wormwood , and give them water of gall to drink .
and let them make haste , and take up a wailing for us , that our eyes may run down with tears , and our eyelids gush out with waters .
thus saith the lord of hosts , consider ye , and call for the mourning women , that they may come ; and send for cunning women , that they may come :
thou shalt surely give him , and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him : because that for this thing the lord thy god shall bless thee in all thy works , and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto .
and if thy brother , an hebrew man , or an hebrew woman , be sold unto thee , and serve thee six years ; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee .
for the poor shall never cease out of the land : therefore i command thee , saying , thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother , to thy poor , and to thy needy , in thy land .
thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock , and out of thy floor , and out of thy winepress : of that wherewith the lord thy god hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him .
and when thou sendest him out free from thee , thou shalt not let him go away empty :
for he hath delivered me out of all trouble : and mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies .
behold , god is mine helper : the lord is with them that uphold my soul .
for strangers are risen up against me , and oppressors seek after my soul : they have not set god before them . selah .
i will freely sacrifice unto thee : i will praise thy name , o lord ; for it is good .
he shall reward evil unto mine enemies : cut them off in thy truth .
and i will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth , blood , and fire , and pillars of smoke .
and it shall come to pass , that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be delivered : for in mount zion and in jerusalem shall be deliverance , as the lord hath said , and in the remnant whom the lord shall call .
the sun shall be turned into darkness , and the moon into blood , before the great and the terrible day of the lord come .
only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof ; thou shalt pour it upon the ground as water .
thou shalt eat it within thy gates : the unclean and the clean person shall eat it alike , as the roebuck , and as the hart .
and if there be any blemish therein , as if it be lame , or blind , or have any ill blemish , thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the lord thy god .
thou shalt eat it before the lord thy god year by year in the place which the lord shall choose , thou and thy household .
that they may teach the young women to be sober , to love their husbands , to love their children ,
the aged women likewise , that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness , not false accusers , not given to much wine , teachers of good things ;
young men likewise exhort to be sober minded .
to be discreet , chaste , keepers at home , good , obedient to their own husbands , that the word of god be not blasphemed .
that the aged men be sober , grave , temperate , sound in faith , in charity , in patience .
but speak thou the things which become sound doctrine :
be glad then , ye children of zion , and rejoice in the lord your god : for he hath given you the former rain moderately , and he will cause to come down for you the rain , the former rain , and the latter rain in the first month .
be not afraid , ye beasts of the field : for the pastures of the wilderness do spring , for the tree beareth her fruit , the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength .
fear not , o land ; be glad and rejoice : for the lord will do great things .
and ye shall know that i am in the midst of israel , and that i am the lord your god , and none else : and my people shall never be ashamed .
and ye shall eat in plenty , and be satisfied , and praise the name of the lord your god , that hath dealt wondrously with you : and my people shall never be ashamed .
and i will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten , the cankerworm , and the caterpiller , and the palmerworm , my great army which i sent among you .
and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will i pour out my spirit .
and it shall come to pass afterward , that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh ; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy , your old men shall dream dreams , your young men shall see visions :
and he made the pillars , and two rows round about upon the one network , to cover the chapiters that were upon the top , with pomegranates : and so did he for the other chapiter .
and nets of checker work , and wreaths of chain work , for the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars ; seven for the one chapiter , and seven for the other chapiter .
and the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily work in the porch , four cubits .
and the foundation was of costly stones , even great stones , stones of ten cubits , and stones of eight cubits .
and above were costly stones , after the measures of hewed stones , and cedars .
he was a widow ' s son of the tribe of naphtali , and his father was a man of tyre , a worker in brass : and he was filled with wisdom , and understanding , and cunning to work all works in brass . and he came to king solomon , and wrought all his work .
and king solomon sent and fetched hiram out of tyre .
and he made two chapiters of molten brass , to set upon the tops of the pillars : the height of the one chapiter was five cubits , and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits :
for he cast two pillars of brass , of eighteen cubits high apiece : and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about .
yea , the lord will answer and say unto his people , behold , i will send you corn , and wine , and oil , and ye shall be satisfied therewith : and i will no more make you a reproach among the heathen :
let the priests , the ministers of the lord , weep between the porch and the altar , and let them say , spare thy people , o lord , and give not thine heritage to reproach , that the heathen should rule over them : wherefore should they say among the people , where is their god ?
then will the lord be jealous for his land , and pity his people .
blow the trumpet in zion , sanctify a fast , call a solemn assembly :
gather the people , sanctify the congregation , assemble the elders , gather the children , and those that suck the breasts : let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber , and the bride out of her closet .
and rend your heart , and not your garments , and turn unto the lord your god : for he is gracious and merciful , slow to anger , and of great kindness , and repenteth him of the evil .
who knoweth if he will return and repent , and leave a blessing behind him ; even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the lord your god ?
and the lord shall utter his voice before his army : for his camp is very great : for he is strong that executeth his word : for the day of the lord is great and very terrible ; and who can abide it ?
therefore also now , saith the lord , turn ye even to me with all your heart , and with fasting , and with weeping , and with mourning :
the earth shall quake before them ; the heavens shall tremble : the sun and the moon shall be dark , and the stars shall withdraw their shining :
and on the borders that were between the ledges were lions , oxen , and cherubims : and upon the ledges there was a base above : and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work .
and the work of the bases was on this manner : they had borders , and the borders were between the ledges :
and he made a molten sea , ten cubits from the one brim to the other : it was round all about , and his height was five cubits : and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about .
and upon the top of the pillars was lily work : so was the work of the pillars finished .
and he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple : and he set up the right pillar , and called the name thereof jachin : and he set up the left pillar , and he called the name thereof boaz .
and the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above , over against the belly which was by the network : and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter .
and he made ten bases of brass ; four cubits was the length of one base , and four cubits the breadth thereof , and three cubits the height of it .
and it was an hand breadth thick , and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup , with flowers of lilies : it contained two thousand baths .
it stood upon twelve oxen , three looking toward the north , and three looking toward the west , and three looking toward the south , and three looking toward the east : and the sea was set above upon them , and all their hinder parts were inward .
and every base had four brasen wheels , and plates of brass : and the four corners thereof had undersetters : under the laver were undersetters molten , at the side of every addition .
for in that he himself hath suffered being tempted , he is able to succour them that are tempted .
and he put five bases on the right side of the house , and five on the left side of the house : and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south .
for it became him , for whom are all things , and by whom are all things , in bringing many sons unto glory , to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings .
for on the plates of the ledges thereof , and on the borders thereof , he graved cherubims , lions , and palm trees , according to the proportion of every one , and additions round about .
for both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one : for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren ,
and in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high : and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same .
saying , i will declare thy name unto my brethren , in the midst of the church will i sing praise unto thee .
then made he ten lavers of brass : one laver contained forty baths : and every laver was four cubits : and upon every one of the ten bases one laver .
and again , i will put my trust in him . and again , behold i and the children which god hath given me .
after this manner he made the ten bases : all of them had one casting , one measure , and one size .
forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood , he also himself likewise took part of the same ; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death , that is , the devil ;
and under the borders were four wheels ; and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base : and the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half a cubit .
and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage .
and the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit : but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base , a cubit and an half : and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders , foursquare , not round .
for verily he took not on him the nature of angels ; but he took on him the seed of abraham .
and there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base : and the undersetters were of the very base itself .
all my bones shall say , lord , who is like unto thee , which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him , yea , the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him ?
wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren , that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to god , to make reconciliation for the sins of the people .
and the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel : their axletrees , and their naves , and their felloes , and their spokes , were all molten .
false witnesses did rise up ; they laid to my charge things that i knew not .
they rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul .
but as for me , when they were sick , my clothing was sackcloth : i humbled my soul with fasting ; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom .
the two pillars , and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars ; and the two networks , to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars ;
i behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother : i bowed down heavily , as one that mourneth for his mother .
but in mine adversity they rejoiced , and gathered themselves together : yea , the abjects gathered themselves together against me , and i knew it not ; they did tear me , and ceased not :
with hypocritical mockers in feasts , they gnashed upon me with their teeth .
lord , how long wilt thou look on ? rescue my soul from their destructions , my darling from the lions .
i will give thee thanks in the great congregation : i will praise thee among much people .
let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me : neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause .
speak , and say , thus saith the lord god ; behold , i am against thee , pharaoh king of egypt , the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers , which hath said , my river is mine own , and i have made it for myself .
but i will put hooks in thy jaws , and i will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales , and i will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers , and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales .
in the tenth year , in the tenth month , in the twelfth day of the month , the word of the lord came unto me , saying ,
son of man , set thy face against pharaoh king of egypt , and prophesy against him , and against all egypt :
and the candlesticks of pure gold , five on the right side , and five on the left , before the oracle , with the flowers , and the lamps , and the tongs of gold ,
when they took hold of thee by thy hand , thou didst break , and rend all their shoulder : and when they leaned upon thee , thou brakest , and madest all their loins to be at a stand .
and solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the lord : the altar of gold , and the table of gold , whereupon the shewbread was ,
therefore thus saith the lord god ; behold , i will bring a sword upon thee , and cut off man and beast out of thee .
and solomon left all the vessels unweighed , because they were exceeding many : neither was the weight of the brass found out .
and i will leave thee thrown into the wilderness , thee and all the fish of thy rivers : thou shalt fall upon the open fields ; thou shalt not be brought together , nor gathered : i have given thee for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven .
in the plain of jordan did the king cast them , in the clay ground between succoth and zarthan .
and all the inhabitants of egypt shall know that i am the lord , because they have been a staff of reed to the house of israel .
yea , they opened their mouth wide against me , and said , aha , aha , our eye hath seen it .
and one sea , and twelve oxen under the sea ;
for they speak not peace : but they devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the land .
and the land of egypt shall be desolate and waste ; and they shall know that i am the lord : because he hath said , the river is mine , and i have made it .
and four hundred pomegranates for the two networks , even two rows of pomegranates for one network , to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars ;
so was ended all the work that king solomon made for the house of the lord . and solomon brought in the things which david his father had dedicated ; even the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , did he put among the treasures of the house of the lord .
judge me , o lord my god , according to thy righteousness ; and let them not rejoice over me .
let them not say in their hearts , ah , so would we have it : let them not say , we have swallowed him up .
this thou hast seen , o lord : keep not silence : o lord , be not far from me .
and the bowls , and the snuffers , and the basons , and the spoons , and the censers of pure gold ; and the hinges of gold , both for the doors of the inner house , the most holy place , and for the doors of the house , to wit , of the temple .
stir up thyself , and awake to my judgment , even unto my cause , my god and my lord .
and my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise all the day long .
let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt : let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify themselves against me .
let them shout for joy , and be glad , that favour my righteous cause : yea , let them say continually , let the lord be magnified , which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant .
( for we are but of yesterday , and know nothing , because our days upon earth are a shadow : )
for inquire , i pray thee , of the former age , and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers :
though thy beginning was small , yet thy latter end should greatly increase .
if thou wert pure and upright ; surely now he would awake for thee , and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous .
if thou wouldest seek unto god betimes , and make thy supplication to the almighty ;
if thy children have sinned against him , and he have cast them away for their transgression ;
doth god pervert judgment ? or doth the almighty pervert justice ?
and it shall come to pass , that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in ; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily .
and moses and aaron said unto all the children of israel , at even , then ye shall know that the lord hath brought you out from the land of egypt :
then said the lord unto moses , behold , i will rain bread from heaven for you ; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day , that i may prove them , whether they will walk in my law , or no .
and moses spake unto aaron , say unto all the congregation of the children of israel , come near before the lord : for he hath heard your murmurings .
and moses said , this shall be , when the lord shall give you in the evening flesh to eat , and in the morning bread to the full ; for that the lord heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him : and what are we ? your murmurings are not against us , but against the lord .
and they took their journey from elim , and all the congregation of the children of israel came unto the wilderness of sin , which is between elim and sinai , on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of egypt .
and the whole congregation of the children of israel murmured against moses and aaron in the wilderness :
then answered bildad the shuhite , and said ,
how long wilt thou speak these things ? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind ?
therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people , and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled , as shalman spoiled beth - arbel in the day of battle : the mother was dashed in pieces upon her children .
so shall bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness : in a morning shall the king of israel utterly be cut off .
them also king david dedicated unto the lord , with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations ; from edom , and from moab , and from the children of ammon , and from the philistines , and from amalek .
he sent hadoram his son to king david , to inquire of his welfare , and to congratulate him , because he had fought against hadarezer , and smitten him ; ( for hadarezer had war with tou ; ) and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass .
and he put garrisons in edom ; and all the edomites became david ' s servants . thus the lord preserved david whithersoever he went .
it is in my desire that i should chastise them ; and the people shall be gathered against them , when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows .
moreover abishai the son of zeruiah slew of the edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand .
and ephraim is as an heifer that is taught , and loveth to tread out the corn ; but i passed over upon her fair neck : i will make ephraim to ride ; judah shall plow , and jacob shall break his clods .
and joab the son zeruiah was over the host ; and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud , recorder .
sow to yourselves in righteousness , reap in mercy ; break up your fallow ground : for it is time to seek the lord , till he come and rain righteousness upon you .
so david reigned over all israel , and executed judgment and justice among all his people .
ye have plowed wickedness , ye have reaped iniquity ; ye have eaten the fruit of lies : because thou didst trust in thy way , in the multitude of thy mighty men .
and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over the cherethites and the pelethiten of ahitub , and abimelech the son of abiathar , were the priests ; and shavsha was scribe ;
and zadok the son of ahitub , and abimelech the son of abiathar , were the priests ; and shavsha was scribe ;
with twelve hundred chariots , and threescore thousand horsemen : and the people were without number that came with him out of egypt ; the lubims , the sukkiims , and the ethiopians .
and it came to pass , that in the fifth year of king rehoboam shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem , because they had transgressed against the lord ,
then came shemaiah the prophet to rehoboam , and to the princes of judah , that were gathered together to jerusalem because of shishak , and said unto them , thus saith the lord , ye have forsaken me , and therefore have i also left you in the hand of shishak .
and he took the fenced cities which pertained to judah , and came to jerusalem .
and when the lord saw that they humbled themselves , the word of the lord came to shemaiah , saying , they have humbled themselves ; therefore i will not destroy them , but i will grant them some deliverance ; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon jerusalem by the hand of shishak .
whereupon the princes of israel and the king humbled themselves ; and they said , the lord is righteous .
so shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem , and took away the treasures of the house of the lord , and the treasures of the king ' s house ; he took all : he carried away also the shields of gold which solomon had made .
nevertheless they shall be his servants ; that they may know my service , and the service of the kingdoms of the countries .
and it came to pass , when rehoboam had established the kingdom , and had strengthened himself , he forsook the law of the lord , and all israel with him .
then hazael king of syria went up , and fought against gath , and took it : and hazael set his face to go up to jerusalem .
the trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house of the lord : it was the priests ' .
and the rest of the acts of joash , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah ?
howbeit there were not made for the house of the lord bowls of silver , snuffers , basons , trumpets , any vessels of gold , or vessels of silver , of the money that was brought into the house of the lord :
and to masons , and hewers of stone , and to buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the lord , and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it .
moreover they reckoned not with the men , into whose hand they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen : for they dealt faithfully .
but they gave that to the workmen , and repaired therewith the house of the lord .
and they gave the money , being told , into the hands of them that did the work , that had the oversight of the house of the lord : and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders , that wrought upon the house of the lord ,
and it was so , when they saw that there was much money in the chest , that the king ' s scribe and the high priest came up , and they put up in bags , and told the money that was found in the house of the lord .
for jozachar the son of shimeath , and jehozabad the son of shomer , his servants , smote him , and he died ; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of david : and amaziah his son reigned in his stead .
and his servants arose , and made a conspiracy , and slew joash in the house of millo , which goeth down to silla .
and he made two cherubims of gold , beaten out of one piece made he them , on the two ends of the mercy seat ;
and he made the mercy seat of pure gold : two cubits and a half was the length thereof , and one cubit and a half the breadth thereof .
and he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark , to bear the ark .
and he made staves of shittim wood , and overlaid them with gold .
and the cherubims spread out their wings on high , and covered with their wings over the mercy seat , with their faces one to another ; even to the mercy seatward were the faces of the cherubims .
and he cast for it four rings of gold , to be set by the four corners of it ; even two rings upon the one side of it , and two rings upon the other side of it .
and he overlaid it with pure gold within and without , and made a crown of gold to it round about .
and bezaleel made the ark of shittim wood : two cubits and a half was the length of it , and a cubit and a half the breadth of it , and a cubit and a half the height of it :
and the residue of the number of archers , the mighty men of the children of kedar , shall be diminished : for the lord god of israel hath spoken it .
for thus hath the lord said unto me , within a year , according to the years of an hireling , and all the glory of kedar shall fail :
for they fled from the swords , from the drawn sword , and from the bent bow , and from the grievousness of war .
the burden upon arabia . in the forest in arabia shall ye lodge , o ye travelling companies of dedanim .
the inhabitants of the land of tema brought water to him that was thirsty , they prevented with their bread him that fled .
the burden of dumah . he calleth to me out of seir , watchman , what of the night ? watchman , what of the night ?
the watchman said , the morning cometh , and also the night : if ye will inquire , inquire ye : return , come .
o my threshing , and the corn of my floor : that which i have heard of the lord of hosts , the god of israel , have i declared unto you .
in that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of david and to the inhabitants of jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness .
and it shall come to pass in that day , saith the lord of hosts , that i will cut off the names of the idols out of the land , and they shall no more be remembered : and also i will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision , when he hath prophesied ; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive :
but he shall say , i am no prophet , i am an husbandman ; for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth .
and one shall say unto him , what are these wounds in thine hands ? then he shall answer , those with which i was wounded in the house of my friends .
awake , o sword , against my shepherd , and against the man that is my fellow , saith the lord of hosts : smite the shepherd , and the sheep shall be scattered : and i will turn mine hand upon the little ones .
and it shall come to pass , that in all the land , saith the lord , two parts therein shall be cut off and die ; but the third shall be left therein .
god understandeth the way thereof , and he knoweth the place thereof .
for he looketh to the ends of the earth , and seeth under the whole heaven ;
to make the weight for the winds ; and he weigheth the waters by measure .
when he made a decree for the rain , and a way for the lightning of the thunder :
whence then cometh wisdom ? and where is the place of understanding ?
seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living , and kept close from the fowls of the air .
destruction and death say , we have heard the fame thereof with our ears .
holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught , that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers .
but a lover of hospitality , a lover of good men , sober , just , holy , temperate ;
and unto man he said , behold , the fear of the lord , that is wisdom ; and to depart from evil is understanding .
then did he see it , and declare it ; he prepared it , yea , and searched it out .
for thou art great , and doest wondrous things : thou art god alone .
teach me thy way , o lord ; i will walk in thy truth : unite my heart to fear thy name .
i will praise thee , o lord my god , with all my heart : and i will glorify thy name for evermore .
for great is thy mercy toward me : and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell .
o god , the proud are risen against me , and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul ; and have not set thee before them .
the word that came to jeremiah from the lord , saying ,
but thou , o lord , art a god full of compassion , and gracious , longsuffering , and plenteous in mercy and truth .
stand in the gate of the lord ' s house , and proclaim there this word , and say , hear the word of the lord , all ye of judah , that enter in at these gates to worship the lord .
o turn unto me , and have mercy upon me ; give thy strength unto thy servant , and save the son of thine handmaid .
thus saith the lord of hosts , the god of israel , amend your ways and your doings , and i will cause you to dwell in this place .
shew me a token for good ; that they which hate me may see it , and be ashamed : because thou , lord , hast holpen me , and comforted me .
trust ye not in lying words , saying , the temple of the lord , the temple of the lord , the temple of the lord , are these .
for if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings ; if ye throughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour ;
if ye oppress not the stranger , the fatherless , and the widow , and shed not innocent blood in this place , neither walk after other gods to your hurt :
then will i cause you to dwell in this place , in the land that i gave to your fathers , for ever and ever .
behold , ye trust in lying words , that cannot profit .
will ye steal , murder , and commit adultery , and swear falsely , and burn incense unto baal , and walk after other gods whom ye know not ;
and the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness : for they kindled a fire , and received us every one , because of the present rain , and because of the cold .
in the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island , whose name was publius ; who received us , and lodged us three days courteously .
howbeit they looked when he should have swollen , or fallen down dead suddenly : but after they had looked a great while , and saw no harm come to him , they changed their minds , and said that he was a god .
and he shook off the beast into the fire , and felt no harm .
and when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand , they said among themselves , no doubt this man is a murderer , whom , though he hath escaped the sea , yet vengeance suffereth not to live .
for in the hand of the lord there is a cup , and the wine is red ; it is full of mixture ; and he poureth out of the same : but the dregs thereof , all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out , and drink them .
but i will declare for ever ; i will sing praises to the god of jacob .
so when this was done , others also , which had diseases in the island , came , and were healed :
and it came to pass , that the father of publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux : to whom paul entered in , and prayed , and laid his hands on him , and healed him .
i said unto the fools , deal not foolishly : and to the wicked , lift not up the horn :
lift not up your horn on high : speak not with a stiff neck .
for promotion cometh neither from the east , nor from the west , nor from the south .
but god is the judge : he putteth down one , and setteth up another .
and there went out a champion out of the camp of the philistines , named goliath , of gath , whose height was six cubits and a span .
now the philistines gathered together their armies to battle , and were gathered together at shochoh , which belongeth to judah , and pitched between shochoh and azekah , in ephes - dammim .
and saul and the men of israel were gathered together , and pitched by the valley of elah , and set the battle in array against the philistines .
and the staff of his spear was like a weaver ' s beam ; and his spear ' s head weighed six hundred shekels of iron : and one bearing a shield went before him .
and he stood and cried unto the armies of israel , and said unto them , why are ye come out to set your battle in array ? am not i a philistine , and ye servants to saul ? choose you a man for you , and let him come down to me .
and he had greaves of brass upon his legs , and a target of brass between his shoulders .
if he be able to fight with me , and to kill me , then will we be your servants : but if i prevail against him , and kill him , then shall ye be our servants , and serve us .
and he said unto them , which of you shall have a friend , and shall go unto him at midnight , and say unto him , friend , lend me three loaves ;
he cutteth out rivers among the rocks ; and his eye seeth every precious thing .
and forgive us our sins ; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us . and lead us not into temptation ; but deliver us from evil .
he bindeth the floods from overflowing ; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light .
give us day by day our daily bread .
and he said unto them , when ye pray , say , our father which art in heaven , hallowed be thy name . thy kingdom come . thy will be done , as in heaven , so in earth .
and it came to pass , that , as he was praying in a certain place , when he ceased , one of his disciples said unto him , lord , teach us to pray , as john also taught his disciples .
the depth saith , it is not in me : and the sea saith , it is not with me .
it cannot be gotten for gold , neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof .
but where shall wisdom be found ? and where is the place of understanding ?
man knoweth not the price thereof ; neither is it found in the land of the living .
if any be blameless , the husband of one wife , having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly .
for a bishop must be blameless , as the steward of god ; not selfwilled , not soon angry , not given to wine , no striker , not given to filthy lucre ;
to titus , mine own son after the common faith : grace , mercy , and peace , from god the father and the lord jesus christ our saviour .
for this cause left i thee in crete , that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting , and ordain elders in every city , as i had appointed thee :
in hope of eternal life , which god , that cannot lie , promised before the world began ;
but hath in due times manifested his word through preaching , which is committed unto me according to the commandment of god our saviour ;
paul , a servant of god , and an apostle of jesus christ , according to the faith of god ' s elect , and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness ;
the topaz of ethiopia shall not equal it , neither shall it be valued with pure gold .
no mention shall be made of coral , or of pearls : for the price of wisdom is above rubies .
the gold and the crystal cannot equal it : and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold .
it cannot be valued with the gold of ophir , with the precious onyx , or the sapphire .
and he from within shall answer and say , trouble me not : the door is now shut , and my children are with me in bed ; i cannot rise and give thee .
for a friend of mine in his journey is come to me , and i have nothing to set before him ?
i say unto you , though he will not rise and give him , because he is his friend , yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth .
they shall be carried to babylon , and there shall they be until the day that i visit them , saith the lord ; then will i bring them up , and restore them to this place .
a voice of crying shall be from horonaim , spoiling and great destruction .
moab is destroyed ; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard .
for in the going up of luhith continual weeping shall go up ; for in the going down of horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction .
flee , save your lives , and be like the heath in the wilderness .
and the two kidneys , and the fat that is upon them , which is by the flanks , and the caul above the liver , with the kidneys , it shall he take away .
against moab thus saith the lord of hosts , the god of israel ; woe unto nebo ! for it is spoiled : kiriathaim is confounded and taken : misgab is confounded and dismayed .
there shall be no more praise of moab : in heshbon they have devised evil against it ; come , and let us cut it off from being a nation . also thou shalt be cut down , o madmen ; the sword shall pursue thee .
and if his offering be a goat , then he shall offer it before the lord .
and the priest shall burn it upon the altar : it is the food of the offering made by fire unto the lord .
and he shall offer thereof his offering , even an offering made by fire unto the lord ; the fat that covereth the inwards , and all the fat that is upon the inwards ,
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of it , and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation : and the sons of aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about .
and the priest shall burn them upon the altar : it is the food of the offering made by fire for a sweet savour : all the fat is the lord ' s .
and the two kidneys , and the fat that is upon them , which is by the flanks , and the caul above the liver , with the kidneys , it shall he take away .
it shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all your dwellings , that ye eat neither fat nor blood .
when i shall receive the congregation i will judge uprightly .
and the spoiler shall come upon every city , and no city shall escape : the valley also shall perish , and the plain shall be destroyed , as the lord hath spoken .
the earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved : i bear up the pillars of it . selah .
for because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures , thou shalt also be taken : and chemosh shall go forth into captivity with his priests and his princes together .
unto thee , o god , do we give thanks , unto thee do we give thanks : for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare .
give wings unto moab , that it may flee and get away : for the cities thereof shall be desolate , without any to dwell therein .
and against the wall of the house he built chambers round about , against the walls of the house round about , both of the temple and of the oracle : and he made chambers round about :
the nethermost chamber was five cubits broad , and the middle was six cubits broad , and the third was seven cubits broad : for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about , that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house .
and the porch before the temple of the house , twenty cubits was the length thereof , according to the breadth of the house ; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house .
and for the house he made windows of narrow lights .
so he built the house , and finished it ; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar .
and the house , when it was in building , was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither : so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house , while it was in building .
the door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house : and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber , and out of the middle into the third .

then he called his twelve disciples together , and gave them power and authority over all devils , and to cure diseases .
after that he appeared in another form unto two of them , as they walked , and went into the country .
and whatsoever house ye enter into , there abide , and thence depart .
and they , when they had heard that he was alive , and had been seen of her , believed not .
and he said unto them , take nothing for your journey , neither staves , nor scrip , neither bread , neither money ; neither have two coats apiece .
and she went and told them that had been with him , as they mourned and wept .
give us help from trouble : for vain is the help of man .
through god we shall do valiantly : for he it is that shall tread down our enemies .
who will bring me into the strong city ? who will lead me into edom ?
wilt not thou , o god , who hast cast us off ? and wilt not thou , o god , go forth with our hosts ?
and herod said , john have i beheaded : but who is this , of whom i hear such things ? and he desired to see him .
they ravished the women in zion , and the maids in the cities of judah .
our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine .
and they departed , and went through the towns , preaching the gospel , and healing every where .
they took the young men to grind , and the children fell under the wood .
and whosoever will not receive you , when ye go out of that city , shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them .
princes are hanged up by their hand : the faces of elders were not honoured .
and of some , that elias had appeared ; and of others , that one of the old prophets was risen again .
the joy of our heart is ceased ; our dance is turned into mourning .
now herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him : and he was perplexed , because that it was said of some , that john was risen from the dead ;
the elders have ceased from the gate , the young men from their musick .
and the thing was known to mordecai , who told it unto esther the queen ; and esther certified the king thereof in mordecai ' s name .
and when inquisition was made of the matter , it was found out ; therefore they were both hanged on a tree : and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king .
in those days , while mordecai sat in the king ' s gate , two of the king ' s chamberlains , bigthan and teresh , of those which kept the door , were wroth , and sought to lay hand on the king ahasuerus .
seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread , and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the lord .
unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days ; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee , neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters .
and thou shalt shew thy son in that day , saying , this is done because of that which the lord did unto me when i came forth out of egypt .
and it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand , and for a memorial between thine eyes , that the lord ' s law may be in thy mouth : for with a strong hand hath the lord brought thee out of egypt .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
sanctify unto me all the firstborn , whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of israel , both of man and of beast : it is mine .
and moses said unto the people , remember this day , in which ye came out from egypt , out of the house of bondage ; for by strength of hand the lord brought you out from this place : there shall no leavened bread be eaten .
this day came ye out in the month abib .
but is now made manifest by the appearing of our saviour jesus christ , who hath abolished death , and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel :
hold fast the form of sound words , which thou hast heard of me , in faith and love which is in christ jesus .
for the which cause i also suffer these things : nevertheless i am not ashamed : for i know whom i have believed , and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which i have committed unto him against that day .
whereunto i am appointed a preacher , and an apostle , and a teacher of the gentiles .
the lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the lord in that day : and in how many things he ministered unto me at ephesus , thou knowest very well .
but , when he was in rome , he sought me out very diligently , and found me .
the lord give mercy unto the house of onesiphorus ; for he oft refreshed me , and was not ashamed of my chain :
this thou knowest , that all they which are in asia be turned away from me ; of whom are phygellus and hermogenes .
son of man , because that tyrus hath said against jerusalem , aha , she is broken that was the gates of the people : she is turned unto me : i shall be replenished , now she is laid waste :
therefore thus saith the lord god ; behold , i am against thee , o tyrus , and will cause many nations to come up against thee , as the sea causeth his waves to come up .
and they shall destroy the walls of tyrus , and break down her towers : i will also scrape her dust from her , and make her like the top of a rock .
it shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea : for i have spoken it , saith the lord god : and it shall become a spoil to the nations .
and her daughters which are in the field shall be slain by the sword ; and they shall know that i am the lord .
for thus saith the lord god ; behold , i will bring upon tyrus nebuchadrezzar king of babylon , a king of kings , from the north , with horses , and with chariots , and with horsemen , and companies , and much people .
he shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field : and he shall make a fort against thee , and cast a mount against thee , and lift up the buckler against thee .
and he shall set engines of war against thy walls , and with his axes he shall break down thy towers .
for my yoke is easy , and my burden is light .
and if a soul sin , and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the lord ; though he wist it not , yet is he guilty , and shall bear his iniquity .
and he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock , with thy estimation , for a trespass offering , unto the priest : and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance wherein he erred and wist it not , and it shall be forgiven him .
i do not frustrate the grace of god : for if righteousness come by the law , then christ is dead in vain .
it is a trespass offering : he hath certainly trespassed against the lord .
i am crucified with christ : nevertheless i live ; yet not i , but christ liveth in me : and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god , who loved me , and gave himself for me .
and the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned in one of these , and it shall be forgiven him : and the remnant shall be the priest ' s , as a meat offering .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
and he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the holy thing , and shall add the fifth part thereto , and give it unto the priest : and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering , and it shall be forgiven him .
and he shall offer the second for a burnt offering , according to the manner : and the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin which he hath sinned , and it shall be forgiven him .
then shall he bring it to the priest , and the priest shall take his handful of it , even a memorial thereof , and burn it on the altar , according to the offerings made by fire unto the lord : it is a sin offering .
at that time jesus answered and said , i thank thee , o father , lord of heaven and earth , because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent , and hast revealed them unto babes .
but i say unto you , that it shall be more tolerable for the land of sodom in the day of judgment , than for thee .
and thou , capernaum , which art exalted unto heaven , shalt be brought down to hell : for if the mighty works , which have been done in thee , had been done in sodom , it would have remained until this day .
but i say unto you , it shall be more tolerable for tyre and sidon at the day of judgment , than for you .
woe unto thee , chorazin ! woe unto thee , bethsaida ! for if the mighty works , which were done in you , had been done in tyre and sidon , they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes .
then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done , because they repented not :
take my yoke upon you , and learn of me ; for i am meek and lowly in heart : and ye shall find rest unto your souls .
come unto me , all ye that labour and are heavy laden , and i will give you rest .
all things are delivered unto me of my father : and no man knoweth the son , but the father ; neither knoweth any man the father , save the son , and he to whomsoever the son will reveal him .
even so , father : for so it seemed good in thy sight .
but when i saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel , i said unto peter before them all , if thou , being a jew , livest after the manner of gentiles , and not as do the jews , why compellest thou the gentiles to live as do the jews ?
for there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever ; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten . and how dieth the wise man ? as the fool .
and the other jews dissembled likewise with him ; insomuch that barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation .
therefore i hated life ; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me : for all is vanity and vexation of spirit .
for before that certain came from james , he did eat with the gentiles : but when they were come , he withdrew and separated himself , fearing them which were of the circumcision .
the wise man ' s eyes are in his head ; but the fool walketh in darkness : and i myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all .
but when peter was come to antioch , i withstood him to the face , because he was to be blamed .
then said i in my heart , as it happeneth to the fool , so it happeneth even to me ; and why was i then more wise ? then i said in my heart , that this also is vanity .
only they would that we should remember the poor ; the same which i also was forward to do .
and i turned myself to behold wisdom , and madness , and folly : for what can the man do that cometh after the king ? even that which hath been already done .
then i saw that wisdom excelleth folly , as far as light excelleth darkness .
and whatsoever mine eyes desired i kept not from them , i withheld not my heart from any joy ; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour : and this was my portion of all my labour .
then i looked on all the works that my hands had wrought , and on the labour that i had laboured to do : and , behold , all was vanity and vexation of spirit , and there was no profit under the sun .
for i through the law am dead to the law , that i might live unto god .
for if i build again the things which i destroyed , i make myself a transgressor .
but if , while we seek to be justified by christ , we ourselves also are found sinners , is therefore christ the minister of sin ? god forbid .
yea , i hated all my labour which i had taken under the sun : because i should leave it unto the man that shall be after me .
we who are jews by nature , and not sinners of the gentiles ,
and who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool ? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein i have laboured , and wherein i have shewed myself wise under the sun . this is also vanity .
for who can eat , or who else can hasten hereunto , more than i ?
for god giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom , and knowledge , and joy : but to the sinner he giveth travail , to gather and to heap up , that he may give to him that is good before god . this also is vanity and vexation of spirit .
for there is a man whose labour is in wisdom , and in knowledge , and in equity ; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion . this also is vanity and a great evil .
for what hath man of all his labour , and of the vexation of his heart , wherein he hath laboured under the sun ?
for all his days are sorrows , and his travail grief ; yea , his heart taketh not rest in the night . this is also vanity .
there is nothing better for a man , than that he should eat and drink , and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour . this also i saw , that it was from the hand of god .
therefore i went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which i took under the sun .
and when he was come unto us , he took paul ' s girdle , and bound his own hands and feet , and said , thus saith the holy ghost , so shall the jews at jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle , and shall deliver him into the hands of the gentiles .
and as we tarried there many days , there came down from judaea a certain prophet , named agabus .
and when he had saluted them , he declared particularly what things god had wrought among the gentiles by his ministry .
and the day following paul went in with us unto james ; and all the elders were present .
and when we were come to jerusalem , the brethren received us gladly .
there went with us also certain of the disciples of caesarea , and brought with them one mnason of cyprus , an old disciple , with whom we should lodge .
and after those days we took up our carriages , and went up to jerusalem .
and when he would not be persuaded , we ceased , saying , the will of the lord be done .
then paul answered , what mean ye to weep and to break mine heart ? for i am ready not to be bound only , but also to die at jerusalem for the name of the lord jesus .
and when we heard these things , both we , and they of that place , besought him not to go up to jerusalem .
do all things without murmurings and disputings :
that ye may be blameless and harmless , the sons of god , without rebuke , in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation , among whom ye shine as lights in the world ;
holding forth the word of life ; that i may rejoice in the day of christ , that i have not run in vain , neither laboured in vain .
yea , and if i be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith , i joy , and rejoice with you all .
for the same cause also do ye joy , and rejoice with me .
but i trust in the lord jesus to send timotheus shortly unto you , that i also may be of good comfort , when i know your state .
that at the name of jesus every knee should bow , of things in heaven , and things in earth , and things under the earth ;
and that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord , to the glory of god the father .
wherefore , my beloved , as ye have always obeyed , not as in my presence only , but now much more in my absence , work out your own salvation with fear and trembling .
for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure .
i hearkened and heard , but they spake not aright : no man repented him of his wickedness , saying , what have i done ? every one turned to his course , as the horse rusheth into the battle .
why then is this people of jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding ? they hold fast deceit , they refuse to return .
how do ye say , we are wise , and the law of the lord is with us ? lo , certainly in vain made he it ; the pen of the scribes is in vain .
yea , the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times ; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming ; but my people know not the judgment of the lord .
at that time , saith the lord , they shall bring out the bones of the kings of judah , and the bones of his princes , and the bones of the priests , and the bones of the prophets , and the bones of the inhabitants of jerusalem , out of their graves :
moreover thou shalt say unto them , thus saith the lord ; shall they fall , and not arise ? shall he turn away , and not return ?
and death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of them that remain of this evil family , which remain in all the places whither i have driven them , saith the lord of hosts .
then the chief captain came near , and took him , and commanded him to be bound with two chains ; and demanded who he was , and what he had done .
who immediately took soldiers and centurions , and ran down unto them : and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers , they left beating of paul .
and as they went about to kill him , tidings came unto the chief captain of the band , that all jerusalem was in an uproar .
and all the city was moved , and the people ran together : and they took paul , and drew him out of the temple : and forthwith the doors were shut .
for the multitude of the people followed after , crying , away with him .
and when he came upon the stairs , so it was , that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people .
but paul said , i am a man which am a jew of tarsus , a city in cilicia , a citizen of no mean city : and , i beseech thee , suffer me to speak unto the people .
art not thou that egyptian , which before these days madest an uproar , and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers ?
and the sons of levi ; gershon , kohath , and merari .
and the sons of judah ; er , and onan , and shelah , and pharez , and zerah : but er and onan died in the land of canaan . and the sons of pharez were hezron and hamul .
and the sons of simeon ; jemuel , and jamin , and ohad , and jachin , and zohar , and shaul the son of a canaanitish woman .
these be the sons of leah , which she bare unto jacob in padan - aram , with his daughter dinah : all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three .
and the sons of gad ; ziphion , and haggi , shuni , and ezbon , eri , and arodi , and areli .
and the sons of issachar ; tola , and phuvah , and job , and shimron .
and the sons of zebulun ; sered , and elon , and jahleel .
the sons of rachel jacob ' s wife ; joseph , and benjamin .
and the sons of asher ; jimnah , and ishuah , and isui , and beriah , and serah their sister : and the sons of beriah ; heber , and malchiel .
these are the sons of zilpah , whom laban gave to leah his daughter , and these she bare unto jacob , even sixteen souls .
and when they heard it , they glorified the lord , and said unto him , thou seest , brother , how many thousands of jews there are which believe ; and they are all zealous of the law :
and they are informed of thee , that thou teachest all the jews which are among the gentiles to forsake moses , saying that they ought not to circumcise their children , neither to walk after the customs .
do therefore this that we say to thee : we have four men which have a vow on them ;
then paul took the men , and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple , to signify the accomplishment of the days of purifcation , until that an offering should be offered for every one of them .
as touching the gentiles which believe , we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing , save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols , and from blood , and from strangled , and from fornication .
crying out , men of israel , help : this is the man , that teacheth all men every where against the people , and the law , and this place : and further brought greeks also into the temple , and hath polluted this holy place .
and when the seven days were almost ended , the jews which were of asia , when they saw him in the temple , stirred up all the people , and laid hands on him ,
and israel said unto joseph , now let me die , since i have seen thy face , because thou art yet alive .
( for they had seen before with him in the city trophimus an ephesian , whom they supposed that paul had brought into the temple . )
and unto joseph in the land of egypt were born manasseh and ephraim , which asenath the daughter of poti - pherah priest of on bare unto him .
and the sons of benjamin were belah , and becher , and ashbel , gera , and naaman , ehi , and rosh , muppim , and huppim , and ard .
these are the sons of rachel , which were born to jacob : all the souls were fourteen .
and the sons of dan ; hushim .
and the sons of naphtali ; jahzeel , and guni , and jezer , and shillem .
these are the sons of bilhah , which laban gave unto rachel his daughter , and she bare these unto jacob : all the souls were seven .
all the souls that came with jacob into egypt , which came out of his loins , besides jacob ' s sons ' wives , all the souls were threescore and six ;
and the sons of joseph , which were born him in egypt , were two souls : all the souls of the house of jacob , which came into egypt , were threescore and ten .
and he sent judah before him unto joseph , to direct his face unto goshen ; and they came into the land of goshen .
and joseph made ready his chariot , and went up to meet israel his father , to goshen , and presented himself unto him ; and he fell on his neck , and wept on his neck a good while .
and he gathered all judah and benjamin , and the strangers with them out of ephraim and manasseh , and out of simeon : for they fell to him out of israel in abundance , when they saw that the lord his god was with him .
be ye strong therefore , and let not your hands be weak : for your work shall be rewarded .
what time i am afraid , i will trust in thee .
in god i will praise his word , in god i have put my trust ; i will not fear what flesh can do unto me .
be merciful unto me , o god : for man would swallow me up ; he fighting daily oppresseth me .
mine enemies would daily swallow me up : for they be many that fight against me , o thou most high .
shall they escape by iniquity ? in thine anger cast down the people , o god .
thou tellest my wanderings : put thou my tears into thy bottle : are they not in thy book ?
every day they wrest my words : all their thoughts are against me for evil .
they gather themselves together , they hide themselves , they mark my steps , when they wait for my soul .
and nation was destroyed of nation , and city of city : for god did vex them with all adversity .
and in those times there was no peace to him that went out , nor to him that came in , but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries .
but when they in their trouble did turn unto the lord god of israel , and sought him , he was found of them .
when i cry unto thee , then shall mine enemies turn back : this i know ; for god is for me .
that ye shall say , thy servants ' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now , both we , and also our fathers : that ye may dwell in the land of goshen ; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the egyptians .
and the spirit of god came upon azariah the son of oded :
and it shall come to pass , when pharaoh shall call you , and shall say , what is your occupation ?
and the men are shepherds , for their trade hath been to feed cattle ; and they have brought their flocks , and their herds , and all that they have .
and joseph said unto his brethren , and unto his father ' s house , i will go up , and shew pharaoh , and say unto him , my brethren , and my father ' s house , which were in the land of canaan , are come unto me ;
and when he had given him licence , paul stood on the stairs , and beckoned with the hand unto the people . and when there was made a great silence , he spake unto them in the hebrew tongue , saying ,
the word of the lord that came to jeremiah the prophet against the philistines , before that pharaoh smote gaza .
at the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong horses , at the rushing of his chariots , and at the rumbling of his wheels , the fathers shall not look back to their children for feebleness of hands ;
thus saith the lord ; behold , waters rise up out of the north , and shall be an overflowing flood , and shall overflow the land , and all that is therein ; the city , and them that dwell therein : then the men shall cry , and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl .
baldness is come upon gaza ; ashkelon is cut off with the remnant of their valley : how long wilt thou cut thyself ?
because of the day that cometh to spoil all the philistines , and to cut off from tyrus and zidon every helper that remaineth : for the lord will spoil the philistines , the remnant of the country of caphtor .
how can it be quiet , seeing the lord hath given it a charge against ashkelon , and against the sea shore ? there hath he appointed it .
o thou sword of the lord , how long will it be ere thou be quiet ? put up thyself into thy scabbard , rest , and be still .
esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred : for mordecai had charged her that she should not shew it .
and when the virgins were gathered together the second time , then mordecai sat in the king ' s gate .
so esther was taken unto king ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month , which is the month tebeth , in the seventh year of his reign .
then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants , even esther ' s feast ; and he made a release to the provinces , and gave gifts , according to the state of the king .
and the king loved esther above all the women , and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins ; so that he set the royal crown upon her head , and made her queen instead of vashti .
the wise men are ashamed , they are dismayed and taken : lo , they have rejected the word of the lord ; and what wisdom is in them ?
and mordecai walked every day before the court of the women ' s house , to know how esther did , and what should become of her .
then thus came every maiden unto the king ; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king ' s house .
neither have i gone back from the commandment of his lips ; i have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food .
my foot hath held his steps , his way have i kept , and not declined .
for he performeth the thing that is appointed for me : and many such things are with him .
but he is in one mind , and who can turn him ? and what his soul desireth , even that he doeth .
for god maketh my heart soft , and the almighty troubleth me :
therefore am i troubled at his presence : when i consider , i am afraid of him .
and the lord shall be king over all the earth : in that day shall there be one lord , and his name one .
because i was not cut off before the darkness , neither hath he covered the darkness from my face .
but it shall be one day which shall be known to the lord , not day , nor night : but it shall come to pass , that at evening time it shall be light .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the light shall not be clear , nor dark :
and ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains ; for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto azal : yea , ye shall flee , like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of uzziah king of judah : and the lord my god shall come , and all the saints with thee .
then shall the lord go forth , and fight against those nations , as when he fought in the day of battle .
for i will gather all nations against jerusalem to battle ; and the city shall be taken , and the houses rifled , and the women ravished ; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity , and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city .
but he knoweth the way that i take : when he hath tried me , i shall come forth as gold .
behold , the day of the lord cometh , and thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee .
now , o lord god , let thy promise unto david my father be established : for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude .
thou shalt also suck the milk of the gentiles , and shalt suck the breast of kings : and thou shalt know that i the lord am thy saviour and thy redeemer , the mighty one of jacob .
and solomon said unto god , thou hast shewed great mercy unto david my father , and hast made me to reign in his stead .
for brass i will bring gold , and for iron i will bring silver , and for wood brass , and for stones iron : i will also make thy officers peace , and thine exactors righteousness .
behold , i will send a blast upon him , and he shall hear a rumour , and return to his own land ; and i will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land .
the sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee ; and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet ; and they shall call thee , the city of the lord , the zion of the holy one of israel .
whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated , so that no man went through thee , i will make thee an eternal excellency , a joy of many generations .
for the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish ; yea , those nations shall be utterly wasted .
the glory of lebanon shall come unto thee , the fir tree , the pine tree , and the box together , to beautify the place of my sanctuary ; and i will make the place of my feet glorious .
and the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls , and their kings shall minister unto thee : for in my wrath i smote thee , but in my favour have i had mercy on thee .
therefore thy gates shall be open continually ; they shall not be shut day nor night ; that men may bring unto thee the forces of the gentiles , and that their kings may be brought .
and solomon the son of david was strengthened in his kingdom , and the lord his god was with him , and magnified him exceedingly .
so solomon , and all the congregation with him , went to the high place that was at gibeon ; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of god , which moses the servant of the lord had made in the wilderness .
then solomon spake unto all israel , to the captains of thousands and of hundreds , and to the judges , and to every governor in all israel , the chief of the fathers .
moreover the brasen altar , that bezaleel the son of uri , the son of hur , had made , he put before the tabernacle of the lord : and solomon and the congregation sought unto it .
but the ark of god had david brought up from kirjath - jearim to the place which david had prepared for it : for he had pitched a tent for it at jerusalem .
in that night did god appear unto solomon , and said unto him , ask what i shall give thee .
violence shall no more be heard in thy land , wasting nor destruction within thy borders ; but thou shalt call thy walls salvation , and thy gates praise .
and solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the lord , which was at the tabernacle of the congregation , and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it .
and he looked , and behold a well in the field , and , lo , there were three flocks of sheep lying by it ; for out of that well they watered the flocks : and a great stone was upon the well ' s mouth .
then jacob went on his journey , and came into the land of the people of the east .
and jacob said unto them , my brethren , whence be ye ? and they said , of haran are we .
and thither were all the flocks gathered : and they rolled the stone from the well ' s mouth , and watered the sheep , and put the stone again upon the well ' s mouth in his place .
but them that are without god judgeth . therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person .
but now i have written unto you not to keep company , if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator , or covetous , or an idolater , or a railer , or a drunkard , or an extortioner ; with such an one no not to eat .
and he sent eliakim , who was over the household , and shebna the scribe , and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth , unto isaiah the prophet the son of amoz .
for what have i to do to judge them also that are without ? do not ye judge them that are within ?
and while he yet spake with them , rachel came with her father ' s sheep : for she kept them .
and it came to pass , when king hezekiah heard it , that he rent his clothes , and covered himself with sackcloth , and went into the house of the lord .
yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world , or with the covetous , or extortioners , or with idolaters ; for then must ye needs go out of the world .
and he said unto them , is he well ? and they said , he is well : and , behold , rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep .
and isaiah said unto them , thus shall ye say unto your master , thus saith the lord , be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard , wherewith the servants of the king of assyria have blasphemed me .
and he said unto them , know ye laban the son of nahor ? and they said , we know him .
so the servants of king hezekiah came to isaiah .
and they said , we cannot , until all the flocks be gathered together , and till they roll the stone from the well ' s mouth ; then we water the sheep .
it may be the lord thy god will hear the words of rabshakeh , whom the king of assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living god , and will reprove the words which the lord thy god hath heard : wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left .
and he said , lo , it is yet high day , neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together : water ye the sheep , and go and feed them .
and they said unto him , thus saith hezekiah , this day is a day of trouble , and of rebuke , and of blasphemy : for the children are come to the birth , and there is not strength to bring forth .
i have compared thee , o my love , to a company of horses in pharaoh ' s chariots .
tell me , o thou whom my soul loveth , where thou feedest , where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon : for why should i be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions ?
if thou know not , o thou fairest among women , go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock , and feed thy kids beside the shepherds ' tents .
i am black , but comely , o ye daughters of jerusalem , as the tents of kedar , as the curtains of solomon .
draw me , we will run after thee : the king hath brought me into his chambers : we will be glad and rejoice in thee , we will remember thy love more than wine : the upright love thee .
because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth , therefore do the virgins love thee .
let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth : for thy love is better than wine .
the song of songs , which is solomon ' s .
and they could not answer him again to these things .
and answered them , saying , which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit , and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day ?
and they held their peace . and he took him , and healed him , and let him go ;
and jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and pharisees , saying , is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day ?
and he that bade thee and him come and say to thee , give this man place ; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room .
when thou art bidden of any man to a wedding , sit not down in the highest room ; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him ;
and he put forth a parable to those which were bidden , when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms ; saying unto them ,
and it came to pass , as he went into the house of one of the chief pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day , that they watched him .
and , behold , there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy .
even that it would please god to destroy me ; that he would let loose his hand , and cut me off !
doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass ? or loweth the ox over his fodder ?
can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt ? or is there any taste in the white of an egg ?
the things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat .
oh that i might have my request ; and that god would grant me the thing that i long for !
therefore let no man glory in men . for all things are yours ;
and again , the lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise , that they are vain .
and ye are christ ' s ; and christ is god ' s .
whether paul , or apollos , or cephas , or the world , or life , or death , or things present , or things to come ; all are yours ;
for the arrows of the almighty are within me , the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit : the terrors of god do set themselves in array against me .
for now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea : therefore my words are swallowed up .
oh that my grief were throughly weighed , and my calamity laid in the balances together !
but job answered and said ,
for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with god . for it is written , he taketh the wise in their own craftiness .
according to the grace of god which is given unto me , as a wise masterbuilder , i have laid the foundation , and another buildeth thereon . but let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon .
now if any man build upon this foundation gold , silver , precious stones , wood , hay , stubble ;
and , behold , i purpose to build an house unto the name of the lord my god , as the lord spake unto david my father , saying , thy son , whom i will set upon thy throne in thy room , he shall build an house unto my name .
but now the lord my god hath given me rest on every side , so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent .
if any man ' s work abide which he hath built thereupon , he shall receive a reward .
and it came to pass , when hiram heard the words of solomon , that he rejoiced greatly , and said , blessed be the lord this day , which hath given unto david a wise son over this great people .
every man ' s work shall be made manifest : for the day shall declare it , because it shall be revealed by fire ; and the fire shall try every man ' s work of what sort it is .
know ye not that ye are the temple of god , and that the spirit of god dwelleth in you ?
my servants shall bring them down from lebanon unto the sea : and i will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me , and will cause them to be discharged there , and thou shalt receive them : and thou shalt accomplish my desire , in giving food for my household .
if any man ' s work shall be burned , he shall suffer loss : but he himself shall be saved ; yet so as by fire .
and hiram sent to solomon , saying , i have considered the things which thou sentest to me for : and i will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar , and concerning timber of fir .
let no man deceive himself . if any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world , let him become a fool , that he may be wise .
if any man defile the temple of god , him shall god destroy ; for the temple of god is holy , which temple ye are .
and hiram king of tyre sent his servants unto solomon ; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father : for hiram was ever a lover of david .
and solomon sent to hiram , saying ,
thou knowest how that david my father could not build an house unto the name of the lord his god for the wars which were about him on every side , until the lord put them under the soles of his feet .
that they might set their hope in god , and not forget the works of god , but keep his commandments :
and might not be as their fathers , a stubborn and rebellious generation ; a generation that set not their heart aright , and whose spirit was not stedfast with god .
for he established a testimony in jacob , and appointed a law in israel , which he commanded our fathers , that they should make them known to their children :
that the generation to come might know them , even the children which should be born ; who should arise and declare them to their children :
which we have heard and known , and our fathers have told us .
we will not hide them from their children , shewing to the generation to come the praises of the lord , and his strength , and his wonderful works that he hath done .
so they gathered themselves together at jerusalem in the third month , in the fifteenth year of the reign of asa .
give ear , o my people , to my law : incline your ears to the words of my mouth .
and they offered unto the lord the same time , of the spoil which they had brought , seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep .
i will open my mouth in a parable : i will utter dark sayings of old :
and they entered into a covenant to seek the lord god of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul ;
that whosoever would not seek the lord god of israel should be put to death , whether small or great , whether man or woman .
and they sware unto the lord with a loud voice , and with shouting , and with trumpets , and with cornets .
and all judah rejoiced at the oath : for they had sworn with all their heart , and sought him with their whole desire ; and he was found of them : and the lord gave them rest round about .
and also concerning maachah the mother of asa the king , he removed her from being queen , because she had made an idol in a grove : and asa cut down her idol , and stamped it , and burnt it at the brook kidron .
but the high places were not taken away out of israel : nevertheless the heart of asa was perfect all his days .
and he brought into the house of god the things that his father had dedicated , and that he himself had dedicated , silver , and gold , and vessels .
the children of ephraim , being armed , and carrying bows , turned back in the day of battle .
and there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of asa .
why art thou cast down , o my soul ? and why art thou disquieted within me ? hope thou in god : for i shall yet praise him , who is the health of my countenance , and my god .
as with a sword in my bones , mine enemies reproach me ; while they say daily unto me , where is thy god ?
and he said unto me , o daniel , a man greatly beloved , understand the words that i speak unto thee , and stand upright : for unto thee am i now sent . and when he had spoken this word unto me , i stood trembling .
then said he unto me , fear not , daniel : for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand , and to chasten thyself before thy god , thy words were heard , and i am come for thy words .
and , behold , an hand touched me , which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands .
and when he had spoken such words unto me , i set my face toward the ground , and i became dumb .
and , behold , one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips : then i opened my mouth , and spake , and said unto him that stood before me , o my lord , by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me , and i have retained no strength .
but the prince of the kingdom of persia withstood me one and twenty days : but , lo , michael , one of the chief princes , came to help me ; and i remained there with the kings of persia .
now i am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days : for yet the vision is for many days .
and said , o man greatly beloved , fear not : peace be unto thee , be strong , yea , be strong . and when he had spoken unto me , i was strengthened , and said , let my lord speak ; for thou hast strengthened me .
for how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord ? for as for me , straightway there remained no strength in me , neither is there breath left in me .
then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man , and he strengthened me ,
and blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine linen , and goats ' hair ,
then said he , knowest thou wherefore i come unto thee ? and now will i return to fight with the prince of persia : and when i am gone forth , lo , the prince of grecia shall come .
and rams ' skins dyed red , and badgers ' skins , and shittim wood ,
but i will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth : and there is none that holdeth with me in these things , but michael your prince .
and oil for the light , and spices for anointing oil , and for the sweet incense ,
six days shall work be done , but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day , a sabbath of rest to the lord : whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death .
and moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of israel , saying , this is the thing which the lord commanded , saying ,
take ye from among you an offering unto the lord : whosoever is of a willing heart , let him bring it , an offering of the lord ; gold , and silver , and brass ,
and moses gathered all the congregation of the children of israel together , and said unto them , these are the words which the lord hath commanded , that ye should do them .
and there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the jews .
there were also that said , we have borrowed money for the king ' s tribute , and that upon our lands and vineyards .
therefore to him that knoweth to do good , and doeth it not , to him it is sin .
some also there were that said , we have mortgaged our lands , vineyards , and houses , that we might buy corn , because of the dearth .
for there were that said , we , our sons , and our daughters , are many : therefore we take up corn for them , that we may eat , and live .
for that ye ought to say , if the lord will , we shall live , and do this , or that .
also i said , it is not good that ye do : ought ye not to walk in the fear of our god because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies ?
but now ye rejoice in your boastings : all such rejoicing is evil .
and i said unto them , we after our ability have redeemed our brethren the jews , which were sold unto the heathen ; and will ye even sell your brethren ? or shall they be sold unto us ? then held they their peace , and found nothing to answer .
go to now , ye that say , to day or to morrow we will go into such a city , and continue there a year , and buy and sell , and get gain :
then i consulted with myself , and i rebuked the nobles , and the rulers , and said unto them , ye exact usury , every one of his brother . and i set a great assembly against them .
whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow . for what is your life ? it is even a vapour , that appeareth for a little time , and then vanisheth away .
and i was very angry when i heard their cry and these words .
and some fell among thorns ; and the thorns sprang up with it , and choked it .
and some fell upon a rock ; and as soon as it was sprung up , it withered away , because it lacked moisture .
and his disciples asked him , saying , what might this parable be ?
and other fell on good ground , and sprang up , and bare fruit an hundredfold . and when he had said these things , he cried , he that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
humble yourselves in the sight of the lord , and he shall lift you up .
the word of the lord came expressly unto ezekiel the priest , the son of buzi , in the land of the chaldeans by the river chebar ; and the hand of the lord was there upon him .
and i looked , and , behold , a whirlwind came out of the north , a great cloud , and a fire infolding itself , and a brightness was about it , and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber , out of the midst of the fire .
there is one lawgiver , who is able to save and to destroy : who art thou that judgest another ?
also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures . and this was their appearance ; they had the likeness of a man .
speak not evil one of another , brethren . he that speaketh evil of his brother , and judgeth his brother , speaketh evil of the law , and judgeth the law : but if thou judge the law , thou art not a doer of the law , but a judge .
and every one had four faces , and every one had four wings .
and joanna the wife of chuza herod ' s steward , and susanna , and many others , which ministered unto him of their substance .
and certain women , which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities , mary called magdalene , out of whom went seven devils ,
a sower went out to sow his seed : and as he sowed , some fell by the way side ; and it was trodden down , and the fowls of the air devoured it .
and when much people were gathered together , and were come to him out of every city , he spake by a parable :
the ancients of gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee thy calkers : all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to occupy thy merchandise .
the inhabitants of zidon and arvad were thy mariners : thy wise men , o tyrus , that were in thee , were thy pilots .
fine linen with broidered work from egypt was that which thou spreadest forth to be thy sail ; blue and purple from the isles of elishah was that which covered thee .
and they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides ; and they four had their faces and their wings .
and their feet were straight feet ; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf ' s foot : and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass .
their wings were joined one to another ; they turned not when they went ; they went every one straight forward .
now , thou son of man , take up a lamentation for tyrus ;
the word of the lord came again unto me , saying ,
of the oaks of bashan have they made thine oars ; the company of the ashurites have made thy benches of ivory , brought out of the isles of chittim .
they have made all thy ship boards of fir trees of senir : they have taken cedars from lebanon to make masts for thee .
thy borders are in the midst of the seas , thy builders have perfected thy beauty .
and say unto tyrus , o thou that art situate at the entry of the sea , which art a merchant of the people for many isles , thus saith the lord god ; o tyrus , thou hast said , i am of perfect beauty .
if we confess our sins , he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins , and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness .
if we say that we have fellowship with him , and walk in darkness , we lie , and do not the truth :
this then is the message which we have heard of him , and declare unto you , that god is light , and in him is no darkness at all .
if we say that we have no sin , we deceive ourselves , and the truth is not in us .
but if we walk in the light , as he is in the light , we have fellowship one with another , and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanseth us from all sin .
( for the life was manifested , and we have seen it , and bear witness , and shew unto you that eternal life , which was with the father , and was manifested unto us ; )
that which was from the beginning , which we have heard , which we have seen with our eyes , which we have looked upon , and our hands have handled , of the word of life ;
and these things write we unto you , that your joy may be full .
that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you , that ye also may have fellowship with us : and truly our fellowship is with the father , and with his son jesus christ .
and i will harden pharaoh ' s heart , that he shall follow after them ; and i will be honoured upon pharaoh , and upon all his host ; that the egyptians may know that i am the lord . and they did so .
for pharaoh will say of the children of israel , they are entangled in the land , the wilderness hath shut them in .
speak unto the children of israel , that they turn and encamp before pi - hahiroth , between migdol and the sea , over against baal - zephon : before it shall ye encamp by the sea .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
and the lord hardened the heart of pharaoh king of egypt , and he pursued after the children of israel : and the children of israel went out with an high hand .
and he made ready his chariot , and took his people with him :
and it was told the king of egypt that the people fled : and the heart of pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people , and they said , why have we done this , that we have let israel go from serving us ?
but the egyptians pursued after them , all the horses and chariots of pharaoh , and his horsemen , and his army , and overtook them encamping by the sea , beside pi - hahiroth , before baal - zephon .
thy sun shall no more go down ; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself : for the lord shall be thine everlasting light , and the days of thy mourning shall be ended .
a little one shall become a thousand , and a small one a strong nation : i the lord will hasten it in his time .
thy people also shall be all righteous : they shall inherit the land for ever , the branch of my planting , the work of my hands , that i may be glorified .
and when even was come , the ship was in the midst of the sea , and he alone on the land .
and when he had sent them away , he departed into a mountain to pray .
and straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship , and to go to the other side before unto bethsaida , while he sent away the people .
and they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men .
and i will rebuke the devourer for your sakes , and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground ; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field , saith the lord of hosts .
bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse , that there may be meat in mine house , and prove me now herewith , saith the lord of hosts , if i will not open you the windows of heaven , and pour you out a blessing , that there shall not be room enough to receive it .
and they did all eat , and were filled .
your words have been stout against me , saith the lord . yet ye say , what have we spoken so much against thee ?
and when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes , he looked up to heaven , and blessed , and brake the loaves , and gave them to his disciples to set before them ; and the two fishes divided he among them all .
and all nations shall call you blessed : for ye shall be a delightsome land , saith the lord of hosts .
and they sat down in ranks , by hundreds , and by fifties .
but when they saw him walking upon the sea , they supposed it had been a spirit , and cried out :
and he saw them toiling in rowing ; for the wind was contrary unto them : and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them , walking upon the sea , and would have passed by them .
and jesus , when he came out , saw much people , and was moved with compassion toward them , because they were as sheep not having a shepherd : and he began to teach them many things .
and the people saw them departing , and many knew him , and ran afoot thither out of all cities , and outwent them , and came together unto him .
send them away , that they may go into the country round about , and into the villages , and buy themselves bread : for they have nothing to eat .
and when the day was now far spent , his disciples came unto him , and said , this is a desert place , and now the time is far passed :
and the apostles gathered themselves together unto jesus , and told him all things , both what they had done , and what they had taught .
and they departed into a desert place by ship privately .
and he said unto them , come ye yourselves apart into a desert place , and rest a while : for there were many coming and going , and they had no leisure so much as to eat .
he saith unto them , how many loaves have ye ? go and see . and when they knew , they say , five , and two fishes .
he answered and said unto them , give ye them to eat . and they say unto him , shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread , and give them to eat ?
and he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass .
speak ye unto all the congregation of israel , saying , in the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb , according to the house of their fathers , a lamb for an house :
but yet in it shall be a tenth , and it shall return , and shall be eaten : as a teil tree , and as an oak , whose substance is in them , when they cast their leaves : so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof .
and if the household be too little for the lamb , let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls ; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb .
and the lord have removed men far away , and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land .
your lamb shall be without blemish , a male of the first year : ye shall take it out from the sheep , or from the goats :
and ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month : and the whole assembly of the congregation of israel shall kill it in the evening .
and the lord spake unto moses and aaron in the land of egypt , saying ,
then said i , lord , how long ? and he answered , until the cities be wasted without inhabitant , and the houses without man , and the land be utterly desolate ,
this month shall be unto you the beginning of months : it shall be the first month of the year to you .
make the heart of this people fat , and make their ears heavy , and shut their eyes ; lest they see with their eyes , and hear with their ears , and understand with their heart , and convert , and be healed .
and they shall take of the blood , and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses , wherein they shall eat it .
and they shall eat the flesh in that night , roast with fire , and unleavened bread ; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it .
eat not of it raw , nor sodden at all with water , but roast with fire ; his head with his legs , and with the purtenance thereof .
and when a convenient day was come , that herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords , high captains , and chief estates of galilee ;
for herod feared john , knowing that he was a just man and an holy , and observed him ; and when he heard him , he did many things , and heard him gladly .
and she came in straightway with haste unto the king , and asked , saying , i will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of john the baptist .
and she went forth , and said unto her mother , what shall i ask ? and she said , the head of john the baptist .
and he sware unto her , whatsoever thou shalt ask of me , i will give it thee , unto the half of my kingdom .
and when the daughter of the said herodias came in , and danced , and pleased herod and them that sat with him , the king said unto the damsel , ask of me whatsoever thou wilt , and i will give it thee .
therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew , and the earth is stayed from her fruit .
and i called for a drought upon the land , and upon the mountains , and upon the corn , and upon the new wine , and upon the oil , and upon that which the ground bringeth forth , and upon men , and upon cattle , and upon all the labour of the hands .
and brought his head in a charger , and gave it to the damsel : and the damsel gave it to her mother .
and immediately the king sent an executioner , and commanded his head to be brought : and he went and beheaded him in the prison ,
then spake haggai the lord ' s messenger in the lord ' s message unto the people , saying , i am with you , saith the lord .
and the king was exceeding sorry ; yet for his oath ' s sake , and for their sakes which sat with him , he would not reject her .
in the four and twentieth day of the sixth month , in the second year of darius the king .
then shall ye return , and discern between the righteous and the wicked , between him that serveth god and him that serveth him not .
then they that feared the lord spake often one to another : and the lord hearkened , and heard it , and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the lord , and that thought upon his name .
and they shall be mine , saith the lord of hosts , in that day when i make up my jewels ; and i will spare them , as a man spareth his own son that serveth him .
ye have said , it is vain to serve god : and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinance , and that we have walked mournfully before the lord of hosts ?
and now we call the proud happy ; yea , they that work wickedness are set up ; yea , they that tempt god are even delivered .
and they went out , and preached that men should repent .
and whosoever shall not receive you , nor hear you , when ye depart thence , shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them . verily i say unto you , it shall be more tolerable for sodom and gomorrha in the day of judgment , than for that city .
and king herod heard of him ; ( for his name was spread abroad : ) and he said , that john the baptist was risen from the dead , and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him .
and they cast out many devils , and anointed with oil many that were sick , and healed them .
but when herod heard thereof , he said , it is john , whom i beheaded : he is risen from the dead .
others said , that it is elias . and others said , that it is a prophet , or as one of the prophets .
for john had said unto herod , it is not lawful for thee to have thy brother ' s wife .
for herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon john , and bound him in prison for herodias ' sake , his brother philip ' s wife : for he had married her .
therefore herodias had a quarrel against him , and would have killed him ; but she could not :
therefore , behold , i will open the side of moab from the cities , from his cities which are on his frontiers , the glory of the country , beth - jeshimoth , baal - meon , and kiriathaim ,
and i will make rabbah a stable for camels , and the ammonites a couchingplace for flocks : and ye shall know that i am the lord .
for thus saith the lord god ; because thou hast clapped thine hands , and stamped with the feet , and rejoiced in heart with all thy despite against the land of israel ;
behold , therefore i will stretch out mine hand upon thee , and will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen ; and i will cut thee off from the people , and i will cause thee to perish out of the countries : i will destroy thee ; and thou shalt know that i am the lord .
thus saith the lord god ; because that moab and seir do say , behold , the house of judah is like unto all the heathen ;
the word of the lord came again unto me , saying ,
son of man , set thy face against the ammonites , and prophesy against them ;
thus saith the lord ; behold , i will give pharaoh - hophra king of egypt into the hand of his enemies , and into the hand of them that seek his life ; as i gave zedekiah king of judah into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon , his enemy , and that sought his life .
and say unto the ammonites , hear the word of the lord god ; thus saith the lord god ; because thou saidst , aha , against my sanctuary , when it was profaned ; and against the land of israel , when it was desolate ; and against the house of judah , when they went into captivity ;
behold , therefore i will deliver thee to the men of the east for a possession , and they shall set their palaces in thee , and make their dwellings in thee : they shall eat thy fruit , and they shall drink thy milk .
and thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering , and all his vessels , and sanctify the altar : and it shall be an altar most holy .
and thou shalt bring aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , and wash them with water .
and thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot , and sanctify it .
and thou shalt bring his sons , and clothe them with coats :
and thou shalt put upon aaron the holy garments , and anoint him , and sanctify him ; that he may minister unto me in the priest ' s office .
thus did moses : according to all that the lord commanded him , so did he .
they are not humbled even unto this day , neither have they feared , nor walked in my law , nor in my statutes , that i set before you and before your fathers .
and thou shalt anoint them , as thou didst anoint their father , that they may minister unto me in the priest ' s office : for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations .
therefore thus saith the lord of hosts , the god of israel ; behold , i will set my face against you for evil , and to cut off all judah .
and moses reared up the tabernacle , and fastened his sockets , and set up the boards thereof , and put in the bars thereof , and reared up his pillars .
and it came to pass in the first month in the second year , on the first day of the month , that the tabernacle was reared up .
so that none of the remnant of judah , which are gone into the land of egypt to sojourn there , shall escape or remain , that they should return into the land of judah , to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there : for none shall return but such as shall escape .
then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods , and all the women that stood by , a great multitude , even all the people that dwelt in the land of egypt , in pathros , answered jeremiah , saying ,
for i will punish them that dwell in the land of egypt , as i have punished jerusalem , by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence :
and when we burned incense to the queen of heaven , and poured out drink offerings unto her , did we make her cakes to worship her , and pour out drink offerings unto her , without our men ?
and all the people said unto samuel , pray for thy servants unto the lord thy god , that we die not : for we have added unto all our sins this evil , to ask us a king .
but since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven , and to pour out drink offerings unto her , we have wanted all things , and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine .
so samuel called unto the lord ; and the lord sent thunder and rain that day : and all the people greatly feared the lord and samuel .
is it not wheat harvest to day ? i will call unto the lord , and he shall send thunder and rain ; that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness is great , which ye have done in the sight of the lord , in asking you a king .
as for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the lord , we will not hearken unto thee .
and when ye saw that nahash the king of the children of ammon came against you , ye said unto me , nay ; but a king shall reign over us : when the lord your god was your king .
and the lord sent jerubbaal , and bedan , and jephthah , and samuel , and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side , and ye dwelled safe .
and they cried unto the lord , and said , we have sinned , because we have forsaken the lord , and have served baalim and ashtaroth : but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies , and we will serve thee .
now therefore stand and see this great thing , which the lord will do before your eyes .
but if ye will not obey the voice of the lord , but rebel against the commandment of the lord , then shall the hand of the lord be against you , as it was against your fathers .
if ye will fear the lord , and serve him , and obey his voice , and not rebel against the commandment of the lord , then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the lord your god :
now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen , and whom ye have desired ! and , behold , the lord hath set a king over you .
and he brought the ark into the tabernacle , and set up the vail of the covering , and covered the ark of the testimony ; as the lord commanded moses .
and he took and put the testimony into the ark , and set the staves on the ark , and put the mercy seat above upon the ark :
and he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation , over against the table , on the side of the tabernacle southward .
and he set the bread in order upon it before the lord ; as the lord had commanded moses .
and he put the table in the tent of the congregation , upon the side of the tabernacle northward , without the vail .
and he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation , and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering ; as the lord commanded moses .
and he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle .
then jeremiah said unto all the people , to the men , and to the women , and to all the people which had given him that answer , saying ,
and he burnt sweet incense thereon ; as the lord commanded moses .
the incense that ye burned in the cities of judah , and in the streets of jerusalem , ye , and your fathers , your kings , and your princes , and the people of the land , did not the lord remember them , and came it not into his mind ?
and he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail :
so that the lord could no longer bear , because of the evil of your doings , and because of the abominations which ye have committed ; therefore is your land a desolation , and an astonishment , and a curse , without an inhabitant , as at this day .
because ye have burned incense , and because ye have sinned against the lord , and have not obeyed the voice of the lord , nor walked in his law , nor in his statutes , nor in his testimonies ; therefore this evil is happened unto you , as at this day .
moreover jeremiah said unto all the people , and to all the women , hear the word of the lord , all judah that are in the land of egypt :
yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of egypt into the land of judah , and all the remnant of judah , that are gone into the land of egypt to sojourn there , shall know whose words shall stand , mine , or theirs .
behold , i will watch over them for evil , and not for good : and all the men of judah that are in the land of egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine , until there be an end of them .
and this shall be a sign unto you , saith the lord , that i will punish you in this place , that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil :
and turn ye not aside : for then should ye go after vain things , which cannot profit nor deliver ; for they are vain .
and samuel said unto the people , fear not : ye have done all this wickedness : yet turn not aside from following the lord , but serve the lord with all your heart ;
moreover as for me , god forbid that i should sin against the lord in ceasing to pray for you : but i will teach you the good and the right way :
for the lord will not forsake his people for his great name ' s sake : because it hath pleased the lord to make you his people .
but if ye shall still do wickedly , ye shall be consumed , both ye and your king .
only fear the lord , and serve him in truth with all your heart : for consider how great things he hath done for you .
and there came out against them zerah the ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand , and three hundred chariots ; and came unto mareshah .
and asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears , out of judah three hundred thousand ; and out of benjamin , that bare shields and drew bows , two hundred and fourscore thousand : all these were mighty men of valour .
and azel had six sons , whose names are these , azrikam , bocheru , and ishmael , and sheariah , and obadiah , and hanan : these were the sons of azel .
and ahaz begat jarah ; and jarah begat alemeth , and azmaveth , and zimri ; and zimri begat moza ;
and the sons of micah were , pithon , and melech , and tahrea , and ahaz .
and the son of jonathan was merib - baal : and merib - baal begat micah .
and asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the lord his god :
for he took away the altars of the strange gods , and the high places , and brake down the images , and cut down the groves :
so abijah slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city of david : and asa his son reigned in his stead . in his days the land was quiet ten years .
and he built fenced cities in judah : for the land had rest , and he had no war in those years ; because the lord had given him rest .
also he took away out of all the cities of judah the high places and the images : and the kingdom was quiet before him .
and gedor , and ahio , and zechariah , and mikloth .
and the children of israel said , who is there among all the tribes of israel that came not up with the congregation unto the lord ? for they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the lord to mizpeh , saying , he shall surely be put to death .
oh that my head were waters , and mine eyes a fountain of tears , that i might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people !
and his firstborn son abdon , then zur , and kish , and baal , and ner , and nadab ,
and it came to pass on the morrow , that the people rose early , and built there an altar , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings .
and ner begat kish ; and kish begat saul ; and saul begat jonathan , and malchi - shua , and abinadab , and esh - baal .
and they bend their tongues like their bow for lies : but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth ; for they proceed from evil to evil , and they know not me , saith the lord .
and mikloth begat shimeam . and they also dwelt with their brethren at jerusalem , over against their brethren .
and the people came to the house of god , and abode there till even before god , and lifted up their voices , and wept sore ;
and these are the singers , chief of the fathers of the levites , who remaining in the chambers were free : for they were employed in that work day and night .
for the people were numbered , and , behold , there were none of the inhabitants of jabesh - gilead there .
and they will deceive every one his neighbour , and will not speak the truth : they have taught their tongue to speak lies , and weary themselves to commit iniquity .
and other of their brethren , of the sons of the kohathites , were over the shewbread , to prepare it every sabbath .
and they said , what one is there of the tribes of israel that came not up to mizpeh to the lord ? and , behold , there came none to the camp from jabesh - gilead to the assembly .
take ye heed every one of his neighbour , and trust ye not in any brother : for every brother will utterly supplant , and every neighbour will walk with slanders .
and in gibeon dwelt the father of gibeon , jehiel , whose wife ' s name was maachah :
how shall we do for wives for them that remain , seeing we have sworn by the lord that we will not give them of our daughters to wives ?
therefore thus saith the lord of hosts , behold , i will melt them , and try them ; for how shall i do for the daughter of my people ?
these chief fathers of the levites were chief throughout their generations ; these dwelt at jerusalem .
and the children of israel repented them for benjamin their brother , and said , there is one tribe cut off from israel this day .
thine habitation is in the midst of deceit ; through deceit they refuse to know me , saith the lord .
and mattithiah , one of the levites , who was the firstborn of shallum the korahite , had the set office over the things that were made in the pans .
and some of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the spices .
some of them also were appointed to oversee the vessels , and all the instruments of the sanctuary , and the fine flour , and the wine , and the oil , and the frankincense , and the spices .
now the men of israel had sworn in mizpeh , saying , there shall not any of us give his daughter unto benjamin to wife .
in four quarters were the porters , toward the east , west , north , and south .
and saul hearkened unto the voice of jonathan : and saul sware , as the lord liveth , he shall not be slain .
so they and their children had the oversight of the gates of the house of the lord , namely , the house of the tabernacle , by wards .
for he did put his life in his hand , and slew the philistine , and the lord wrought a great salvation for all israel : thou sawest it , and didst rejoice : wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood , to slay david without a cause ?
all these which were chosen to be porters in the gates were two hundred and twelve . these were reckoned by their genealogy in their villages , whom david and samuel the seer did ordain in their set office .
and jonathan spake good of david unto saul his father , and said unto him , let not the king sin against his servant , against david ; because he hath not sinned against thee , and because his works have been to theeward very good :
and zechariah the son of meshelemiah was porter of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
and i will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art , and i will commune with my father of thee ; and what i see , that i will tell thee .
and certain of them had the charge of the ministering vessels , that they should bring them in and out by tale .
and they lodged round about the house of god , because the charge was upon them , and the opening thereof every morning pertained to them .
and the evil spirit from the lord was upon saul , as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand : and david played with his hand .
for these levites , the four chief porters , were in their set office , and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house of god .
and there was war again : and david went out , and fought with the philistines , and slew them with a great slaughter ; and they fled from him .
and their brethren , which were in their villages , were to come after seven days from time to time with them .
and jonathan called david , and jonathan shewed him all those things . and jonathan brought david to saul , and he was in his presence , as in times past .
and phinehas the son of eleazar was the ruler over them in time past , and the lord was with him .
but jonathan saul ' s son delighted much in david : and jonathan told david , saying , saul my father seeketh to kill thee : now therefore , i pray thee , take heed to thyself until the morning , and abide in a secret place , and hide thyself :
and saul spake to jonathan his son , and to all his servants , that they should kill david .
will the lord cast off for ever ? and will he be favourable no more ?
i call to remembrance my song in the night : i commune with mine own heart : and my spirit made diligent search .
hath god forgotten to be gracious ? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies ? selah .
is his mercy clean gone for ever ? doth his promise fail for evermore ?
i remembered god , and was troubled : i complained , and my spirit was overwhelmed . selah .
in the day of my trouble i sought the lord : my sore ran in the night , and ceased not : my soul refused to be comforted .
i have considered the days of old , the years of ancient times .
thou holdest mine eyes waking : i am so troubled that i cannot speak .
who hitherto waited in the king ' s gate eastward : they were porters in the companies of the children of levi .
their tongue is as an arrow shot out ; it speaketh deceit : one speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth , but in heart he layeth his wait .
shall i not visit them for these things ? saith the lord : shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this ?
and azariah the son of hilkiah , the son of meshullam , the son of zadok , the son of meraioth , the son of ahitub , the ruler of the house of god ;
and of the priests ; jedaiah , and jehoiarib , and jachin ,
and their brethren , heads of the house of their fathers , a thousand and seven hundred and threescore ; very able men for the work of the service of the house of god .
and adaiah the son of jeroham , the son of pashur , the son of malchijah , and maasiai the son of adiel , the son of jahzerah , the son of meshullam , the son of meshillemith , the son of immer ;
and bakbakkar , heresh , and galal , and mattaniah the son of micah , the son of zichri , the son of asaph ;
and of the levites ; shemaiah the son of hasshub , the son of azrikam , the son of hashabiah , of the sons of merari ;
and the porters were , shallum , and akkub , and talmon , and ahiman , and their brethren : shallum was the chief ;
and obadiah the son of shemaiah , the son of galal , the son of jeduthun , and berechiah the son of asa , the son of elkanah , that dwelt in the villages of the netophathites .
for the love of money is the root of all evil : which while some coveted after , they have erred from the faith , and pierced themselves through with many sorrows .
but thou , o man of god , flee these things ; and follow after righteousness , godliness , faith , love , patience , meekness .
fight the good fight of faith , lay hold on eternal life , whereunto thou art also called , and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses .
i give thee charge in the sight of god , who quickeneth all things , and before christ jesus , who before pontius pilate witnessed a good confession ;
who only hath immortality , dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto ; whom no man hath seen , nor can see : to whom be honour and power everlasting . amen .
which in his times he shall shew , who is the blessed and only potentate , the king of kings , and lord of lords ;
that they do good , that they be rich in good works , ready to distribute , willing to communicate ;
charge them that are rich in this world , that they be not highminded , nor trust in uncertain riches , but in the living god , who giveth us richly all things to enjoy ;
which some professing have erred concerning the faith . 
grace be with thee . amen .
o timothy , keep that which is committed to thy trust , avoiding profane and vain babblings , and oppositions of science falsely so called :
or those eighteen , upon whom the tower in siloam fell , and slew them , think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in jerusalem ?
i tell you , nay : but , except ye repent , ye shall all likewise perish .
he spake also this parable ; a certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard ; and he came and sought fruit thereon , and found none .
then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard , behold , these three years i come seeking fruit on this fig tree , and find none : cut it down ; why cumbereth it the ground ?
and he answering said unto him , lord , let it alone this year also , till i shall dig about it , and dung it :
and if it bear fruit , well : and if not , then after that thou shalt cut it down .

and their brethren , shebaniah , hodijah , kelita , pelaiah , hanan ,
destroy , o lord , and divide their tongues : for i have seen violence and strife in the city .
micha , rehob , hashabiah ,
and i said , oh that i had wings like a dove ! for then would i fly away , and be at rest .
zaccur , sherebiah , shebaniah ,

my heart is sore pained within me : and the terrors of death are fallen upon me .
fearfulness and trembling are come upon me , and horror hath overwhelmed me .
attend unto me , and hear me : i mourn in my complaint , and make a noise ;
because of the voice of the enemy , because of the oppression of the wicked : for they cast iniquity upon me , and in wrath they hate me .
come up , ye horses ; and rage , ye chariots ; and let the mighty men come forth ; the ethiopians and the libyans , that handle the shield ; and the lydians , that handle and bend the bow .
and the rest of the people , the priests , the levites , the porters , the singers , the nethinims , and all they that had separated themselves from the people of the lands unto the law of god , their wives , their sons , and their daughters , every one having knowledge , and having understanding ;
they clave to their brethren , their nobles , and entered into a curse , and into an oath , to walk in god ' s law , which was given by moses the servant of god , and to observe and do all the commandments of the lord our lord , and his judgments and his statutes ;

wherefore have i seen them dismayed and turned away back ? and their mighty ones are beaten down , and are fled apace , and look not back : for fear was round about , saith the lord .

who is this that cometh up as a flood , whose waters are moved as the rivers ?
against egypt , against the army of pharaoh - necho king of egypt , which was by the river euphrates in carchemish , which nebuchadrezzar king of babylon smote in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah .
the word of the lord which came to jeremiah the prophet against the gentiles ;
harness the horses ; and get up , ye horsemen , and stand forth with your helmets ; furbish the spears , and put on the brigandines .
order ye the buckler and shield , and draw near to battle .
and to bring the firstfruits of our ground , and the firstfruits of all fruit of all trees , year by year , unto the house of the lord :
and the priest the son of aaron shall be with the levites , when the levites take tithes : and the levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes unto the house of our god , to the chambers , into the treasure house .
and that we would not give our daughters unto the people of the land , nor take their daughters for our sons :
and if the people of the land bring ware or any victuals on the sabbath day to sell , that we would not buy it of them on the sabbath , or on the holy day : and that we would leave the seventh year , and the exaction of every debt .
also we made ordinances for us , to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our god ;
give ear to my prayer , o god ; and hide not thyself from my supplication .
hath a nation changed their gods , which are yet no gods ? but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit .
for pass over the isles of chittim , and see ; and send unto kedar , and consider diligently , and see if there be such a thing .
this is a faithful saying , and these things i will that thou affirm constantly , that they which have believed in god might be careful to maintain good works . these things are good and profitable unto men .
but avoid foolish questions , and genealogies , and contentions , and strivings about the law ; for they are unprofitable and vain .
which he shed on us abundantly through jesus christ our saviour ;
that being justified by his grace , we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life .
put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers , to obey magistrates , to be ready to every good work ,
for we ourselves also were sometimes foolish , disobedient , deceived , serving divers lusts and pleasures , living in malice and envy , hateful , and hating one another .
to speak evil of no man , to be no brawlers , but gentle , shewing all meekness unto all men .
not by works of righteousness which we have done , but according to his mercy he saved us , by the washing of regeneration , and renewing of the holy ghost ;
but after that the kindness and love of god our saviour toward man appeared ,
there were present at that season some that told him of the galilaeans , whose blood pilate had mingled with their sacrifices .
and jesus answering said unto them , suppose ye that these galilaeans were sinners above all the galilaeans , because they suffered such things ?
i tell you , nay : but , except ye repent , ye shall all likewise perish .
for he longed after you all , and was full of heaviness , because that ye had heard that he had been sick .
yet i supposed it necessary to send to you epaphroditus , my brother , and companion in labour , and fellowsoldier , but your messenger , and he that ministered to my wants .
i sent him therefore the more carefully , that , when ye see him again , ye may rejoice , and that i may be the less sorrowful .
for indeed he was sick nigh unto death : but god had mercy on him ; and not on him only , but on me also , lest i should have sorrow upon sorrow .
receive him therefore in the lord with all gladness ; and hold such in reputation :
how then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master ' s servants , and put thy trust on egypt for chariots and for horsemen ?
now therefore give pledges , i pray thee , to my master the king of assyria , and i will give thee two thousand horses , if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them .
for i have no man likeminded , who will naturally care for your state .
but ye know the proof of him , that , as a son with the father , he hath served with me in the gospel .
for all seek their own , not the things which are jesus christ ' s .
but i trust in the lord that i also myself shall come shortly .
him therefore i hope to send presently , so soon as i shall see how it will go with me .
i cried unto god with my voice , even unto god with my voice ; and he gave ear unto me .
lo , thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed , on egypt ; whereon if a man lean , it will go into his hand , and pierce it : so is pharaoh king of egypt to all that trust in him .
but if thou say to me , we trust in the lord our god : is it not he , whose high places and whose altars hezekiah hath taken away , and said to judah and to jerusalem , ye shall worship before this altar ?
and rabshakeh said unto them , say ye now to hezekiah , thus saith the great king , the king of assyria , what confidence is this wherein thou trustest ?
i say , sayest thou , ( but they are but vain words ) i have counsel and strength for war : now on whom dost thou trust , that thou rebellest against me ?
and the king of assyria sent rabshakeh from lachish to jerusalem unto king hezekiah with a great army . and he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller ' s field .
then came forth unto him eliakim , hilkiah ' s son , which was over the house , and shebna the scribe , and joah , asaph ' s son , the recorder .
now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king hezekiah , that sennacherib king of assyria came up against all the defenced cities of judah , and took them .
because for the work of christ he was nigh unto death , not regarding his life , to supply your lack of service toward me .
yea , thou shalt go forth from him , and thine hands upon thine head : for the lord hath rejected thy confidences , and thou shalt not prosper in them .
why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way ? thou also shalt be ashamed of egypt , as thou wast ashamed of assyria .
yet thou sayest , because i am innocent , surely his anger shall turn from me . behold , i will plead with thee , because thou sayest , i have not sinned .
also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents : i have not found it by secret search , but upon all these .
then sent sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand ;
the son of dekar , in makaz , and in shaalbim , and beth - shemesh , and elon - beth - hanan :
wherein was written , it is reported among the heathen , and gashmu saith it , that thou and the jews think to rebel : for which cause thou buildest the wall , that thou mayest be their king , according to these words .
and thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at jerusalem , saying , there is a king in judah : and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words . come now therefore , and let us take counsel together .
then i sent unto him , saying , there are no such things done as thou sayest , but thou feignest them out of thine own heart .
and ahishar was over the household : and adoniram the son of abda was over the tribute .
now it came to pass , when sanballat , and tobiah , and geshem the arabian , and the rest of our enemies , heard that i had builded the wall , and that there was no breach left therein ; ( though at that time i had not set up the doors upon the gates ; )
and azariah the son of nathan was over the officers : and zabud the son of nathan was principal officer , and the king ' s friend :
that sanballat and geshem sent unto me , saying , come , let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of ono . but they thought to do me mischief .
and these are their names : the son of hur , in mount ephraim :
and i sent messengers unto them , saying , i am doing a great work , so that i cannot come down : why should the work cease , whilst i leave it , and come down to you ?
and solomon had twelve officers over all israel , which provided victuals for the king and his household : each man his month in a year made provision .
yet they sent unto me four times after this sort ; and i answered them after the same manner .
in vain have i smitten your children ; they received no correction : your own sword hath devoured your prophets , like a destroying lion .
o generation , see ye the word of the lord . have i been a wilderness unto israel ? a land of darkness ? wherefore say my people , we are lords ; we will come no more unto thee ?
can a maid forget her ornaments , or a bride her attire ? yet my people have forgotten me days without number .
why trimmest thou thy way to seek love ? therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy ways .
for they all made us afraid , saying , their hands shall be weakened from the work , that it be not done . now therefore , o god , strengthen my hands .
saying to a stock , thou art my father ; and to a stone , thou hast brought me forth : for they have turned their back unto me , and not their face : but in the time of their trouble they will say , arise , and save us .
wherefore will ye plead with me ? ye all have transgressed against me , saith the lord .
a wild ass used to the wilderness , that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure ; in her occasion who can turn her away ? all they that seek her will not weary themselves ; in her month they shall find her .
how canst thou say , i am not polluted , i have not gone after baalim ? see thy way in the valley , know what thou hast done : thou art a swift dromedary traversing her ways ;
as the thief is ashamed when he is found , so is the house of israel ashamed ; they , their kings , their princes , and their priests , and their prophets ,
withhold thy foot from being unshod , and thy throat from thirst : but thou saidst , there is no hope : no ; for i have loved strangers , and after them will i go .
so king solomon was king over all israel .
and these were the princes which he had ; azariah the son of zadok the priest ,
elihoreph and ahiah , the sons of shisha , scribes ; jehoshaphat the son of ahilud , the recorder .
and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over the host : and zadok and abiathar were the priests :
yet i had planted thee a noble vine , wholly a right seed : how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me ?
for though thou wash thee with nitre , and take thee much soap , yet thine iniquity is marked before me , saith the lord god .
for of old time i have broken thy yoke , and burst thy bands ; and thou saidst , i will not transgress ; when upon every high hill and under every green tree thou wanderest , playing the harlot .
thine own wickedness shall correct thee , and thy backslidings shall reprove thee : know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter , that thou hast forsaken the lord thy god , and that my fear is not in thee , saith the lord god of hosts .
and now what hast thou to do in the way of egypt , to drink the waters of sihor ? or what hast thou to do in the way of assyria , to drink the waters of the river ?
hast thou not procured this unto thyself , in that thou hast forsaken the lord thy god , when he led thee by the way ?
also the children of noph and tahapanes have broken the crown of thy head .
the young lions roared upon him , and yelled , and they made his land waste : his cities are burned without inhabitant .
is israel a servant ? is he a homeborn slave ? why is he spoiled ?
for my people have committed two evils ; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters , and hewed them out cisterns , broken cisterns , that can hold no water .
be astonished , o ye heavens , at this , and be horribly afraid , be ye very desolate , saith the lord .
o remember that my life is wind : mine eye shall no more see good .
my days are swifter than a weaver ' s shuttle , and are spent without hope .
my flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust ; my skin is broken , and become loathsome .
when i lie down , i say , when shall i arise , and the night be gone ? and i am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day .
as the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away : so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more .
the eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more : thine eyes are upon me , and i am not .
is there not an appointed time to man upon earth ? are not his days also like the days of an hireling ?
as a servant earnestly desireth the shadow , and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work :
so am i made to possess months of vanity , and wearisome nights are appointed to me .
for the statutes of omri are kept , and all the works of the house of ahab , and ye walk in their counsels ; that i should make thee a desolation , and the inhabitants thereof an hissing : therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people .
thou shalt sow , but thou shalt not reap ; thou shalt tread the olives , but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil ; and sweet wine , but shalt not drink wine .
thou shalt eat , but not be satisfied ; and thy casting down shall be in the midst of thee ; and thou shalt take hold , but shalt not deliver ; and that which thou deliverest will i give up to the sword .
but if the cloud were not taken up , then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up .
therefore also will i make thee sick in smiting thee , in making thee desolate because of thy sins .
for the cloud of the lord was upon the tabernacle by day , and fire was on it by night , in the sight of all the house of israel , throughout all their journeys .
for the rich men thereof are full of violence , and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies , and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth .
shall i count them pure with the wicked balances , and with the bag of deceitful weights ?
are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked , and the scant measure that is abominable ?
and moses and aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat :
when they went into the tent of the congregation , and when they came near unto the altar , they washed ; as the lord commanded moses .
and he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar , and put water there , to wash withal .
and moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation , because the cloud abode thereon , and the glory of the lord filled the tabernacle .
and when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle , the children of israel went onward in all their journeys :
and he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar , and set up the hanging of the court gate . so moses finished the work .
then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation , and the glory of the lord filled the tabernacle .
and he said unto me , son of man , stand upon thy feet , and i will speak unto thee .
and the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me , and set me upon my feet , that i heard him that spake unto me .
and he said unto me , son of man , i send thee to the children of israel , to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me : they and their fathers have transgressed against me , even unto this very day .
for they are impudent children and stiffhearted . i do send thee unto them ; and thou shalt say unto them , thus saith the lord god .
and they , whether they will hear , or whether they will forbear , ( for they are a rebellious house , ) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them .
and thou shalt speak my words unto them , whether they will hear , or whether they will forbear : for they are most rebellious .
and thou , son of man , be not afraid of them , neither be afraid of their words , though briers and thorns be with thee , and thou dost dwell among scorpions : be not afraid of their words , nor be dismayed at their looks , though they be a rebellious house .
and when i looked , behold , an hand was sent unto me ; and , lo , a roll of a book was therein ;
but thou , son of man , hear what i say unto thee ; be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house : open thy mouth , and eat that i give thee .
my little children , these things write i unto you , that ye sin not . and if any man sin , we have an advocate with the father , jesus christ the righteous :
so hiram gave solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his desire .
and hereby we do know that we know him , if we keep his commandments .
and he is the propitiation for our sins : and not for ours only , but also for the sins of the whole world .
but whoso keepeth his word , in him verily is the love of god perfected : hereby know we that we are in him .
and he sent them to lebanon ten thousand a month by courses : a month they were in lebanon , and two months at home : and adoniram was over the levy .
he that saith , i know him , and keepeth not his commandments , is a liar , and the truth is not in him .
and king solomon raised a levy out of all israel ; and the levy was thirty thousand men .
brethren , i write no new commandment unto you , but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning . the old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning .
and the lord gave solomon wisdom , as he promised him : and there was peace between hiram and solomon ; and they two made a league together .
he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk , even as he walked .
and solomon gave hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household , and twenty measures of pure oil : thus gave solomon to hiram year by year .
he that saith he is in the light , and hateth his brother , is in darkness even until now .
and solomon ' s builders and hiram ' s builders did hew them , and the stonesquarers : so they prepared timber and stones to build the house .
again , a new commandment i write unto you , which thing is true in him and in you : because the darkness is past , and the true light now shineth .
and the king commanded , and they brought great stones , costly stones , and hewed stones , to lay the foundation of the house .
beside the chief of solomon ' s officers which were over the work , three thousand and three hundred , which ruled over the people that wrought in the work .
and solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens , and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains ;
greatly desiring to see thee , being mindful of thy tears , that i may be filled with joy ;
when i call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee , which dwelt first in thy grandmother lois , and thy mother eunice ; and i am persuaded that in thee also .
wherefore i put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of god , which is in thee by the putting on of my hands .
for god hath not given us the spirit of fear ; but of power , and of love , and of a sound mind .
paul , an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god , according to the promise of life which is in christ jesus ,
to timothy , my dearly beloved son : grace , mercy , and peace , from god the father and christ jesus our lord .
i thank god , whom i serve from my forefathers with pure conscience , that without ceasing i have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day ;
and in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work , and overlaid them with gold .
and the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long : one wing of the one cherub was five cubits , reaching to the wall of the house : and the other wing was likewise five cubits , reaching to the wing of the other cherub .
and one wing of the other cherub was five cubits , reaching to the wall of the house : and the other wing was five cubits also , joining to the wing of the other cherub .
be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our lord , nor of me his prisoner : but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of god ;
who hath saved us , and called us with an holy calling , not according to our works , but according to his own purpose and grace , which was given us in christ jesus before the world began ,
and moses made haste , and bowed his head toward the earth , and worshipped .
keeping mercy for thousands , forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin , and that will by no means clear the guilty ; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children , and upon the children ' s children , unto the third and to the fourth generation .
and he said , if now i have found grace in thy sight , o lord , let my lord , i pray thee , go among us ; for it is a stiffnecked people ; and pardon our iniquity and our sin , and take us for thine inheritance .
and the lord said unto moses , hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first : and i will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables , which thou brakest .
and he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first ; and moses rose up early in the morning , and went up unto mount sinai , as the lord had commanded him , and took in his hand the two tables of stone .
and no man shall come up with thee , neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount ; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount .
and the lord passed by before him , and proclaimed , the lord , the lord god , merciful and gracious , longsuffering , and abundant in goodness and truth ,
and the lord descended in the cloud , and stood with him there , and proclaimed the name of the lord .
and ran through that whole region round about , and began to carry about in beds those that were sick , where they heard he was .
and whithersoever he entered , into villages , or cities , or country , they laid the sick in the streets , and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment : and as many as touched him were made whole .
and when they had passed over , they came into the land of gennesaret , and drew to the shore .
and when they were come out of the ship , straightway they knew him ,
and he went up unto them into the ship ; and the wind ceased : and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure , and wondered .
for they considered not the miracle of the loaves : for their heart was hardened .
and he made chains , as in the oracle , and put them on the heads of the pillars ; and made an hundred pomegranates , and put them on the chains .
also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high , and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them was five cubits .
and he made the vail of blue , and purple , and crimson , and fine linen , and wrought cherubims thereon .
the wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits : and they stood on their feet , and their faces were inward .
and he reared up the pillars before the temple , one on the right hand , and the other on the left ; and called the name of that on the right hand jachin , and the name of that on the left boaz .
wherefore neither thought i myself worthy to come unto thee : but say in a word , and my servant shall be healed .
for i also am a man set under authority , having under me soldiers , and i say unto one , go , and he goeth ; and to another , come , and he cometh ; and to my servant , do this , and he doeth it .
when jesus heard these things , he marvelled at him , and turned him about , and said unto the people that followed him , i say unto you , i have not found so great faith , no , not in israel .
and when he heard of jesus , he sent unto him the elders of the jews , beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant .
and when they came to jesus , they besought him instantly , saying , that he was worthy for whom he should do this :
for he loveth our nation , and he hath built us a synagogue .
then jesus went with them . and when he was now not far from the house , the centurion sent friends to him , saying unto him , lord , trouble not thyself : for i am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof :
now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people , he entered into capernaum .
and a certain centurion ' s servant , who was dear unto him , was sick , and ready to die .
in the third year of his reign , he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants ; the power of persia and media , the nobles and princes of the provinces , being before him :
when he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days , even an hundred and fourscore days .
now it came to pass in the days of ahasuerus , ( this is ahasuerus which reigned , from india even unto ethiopia , over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces : )
that in those days , when the king ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom , which was in shushan the palace ,
and they gave them drink in vessels of gold , ( the vessels being diverse one from another , ) and royal wine in abundance , according to the state of the king .
and the drinking was according to the law ; none did compel : for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house , that they should do according to every man ' s pleasure .
and when these days were expired , the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in shushan the palace , both unto great and small , seven days , in the court of the garden of the king ' s palace ;
where were white , green , and blue , hangings , fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble : the beds were of gold and silver , upon a pavement of red , and blue , and white , and black , marble .
also vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king ahasuerus .
salute urbane , our helper in christ , and stachys my beloved .
salute andronicus and junia , my kinsmen , and my fellowprisoners , who are of note among the apostles , who also were in christ before me .
greet amplias my beloved in the lord .
i commend unto you phebe our sister , which is a servant of the church which is at cenchrea :
greet mary , who bestowed much labour on us .
greet priscilla and aquila my helpers in christ jesus :
who have for my life laid down their own necks : unto whom not only i give thanks , but also all the churches of the gentiles .
what advantage then hath the jew ? or what profit is there of circumcision ?
much every way : chiefly , because that unto them were committed the oracles of god .
for what if some did not believe ? shall their unbelief make the faith of god without effect ?
god forbid : yea , let god be true , but every man a liar ; as it is written , that thou mightest be justified in thy sayings , and mightest overcome when thou art judged .
and called , and asked whether simon , which was surnamed peter , were lodged there .
what then ? are we better than they ? no , in no wise : for we have before proved both jews and gentiles , that they are all under sin ;
while peter thought on the vision , the spirit said unto him , behold , three men seek thee .
surely the isles shall wait for me , and the ships of tarshish first , to bring thy sons from far , their silver and their gold with them , unto the name of the lord thy god , and to the holy one of israel , because he hath glorified thee .
this was done thrice : and the vessel was received up again into heaven .
now while peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean , behold , the men which were sent from cornelius had made inquiry for simon ' s house , and stood before the gate ,
god forbid : for then how shall god judge the world ?
but peter said , not so , lord ; for i have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean .
but if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of god , what shall we say ? is god unrighteous who taketh vengeance ? ( i speak as a man )
and not rather , ( as we be slanderously reported , and as some affirm that we say , ) let us do evil , that good may come ? whose damnation is just .
wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth , and wild beasts , and creeping things , and fowls of the air .
for if the truth of god hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory ; why yet am i also judged as a sinner ?
and there came a voice to him , rise , peter ; kill , and eat .
and he became very hungry , and would have eaten : but while they made ready , he fell into a trance ,
for , behold , the darkness shall cover the earth , and gross darkness the people : but the lord shall arise upon thee , and his glory shall be seen upon thee .
and saw heaven opened , and a certain vessel descending unto him , as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners , and let down to the earth :
arise , shine ; for thy light is come , and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee .
lift up thine eyes round about , and see : all they gather themselves together , they come to thee : thy sons shall come from far , and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side .
and the gentiles shall come to thy light , and kings to the brightness of thy rising .
the multitude of camels shall cover thee , the dromedaries of midian and ephah ; all they from sheba shall come : they shall bring gold and incense ; and they shall shew forth the praises of the lord .
then thou shalt see , and flow together , and thine heart shall fear , and be enlarged ; because the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee , the forces of the gentiles shall come unto thee .
who are these that fly as a cloud , and as the doves to their windows ?
all the flocks of kedar shall be gathered together unto thee , the rams of nebaioth shall minister unto thee : they shall come up with acceptance on mine altar , and i will glorify the house of my glory .
a good name is better than precious ointment ; and the day of death than the day of one ' s birth .
sorrow is better than laughter : for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better .
the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning ; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth .
it is better to hear the rebuke of the wise , than for a man to hear the song of fools .
for as the crackling of thorns under a pot , so is the laughter of the fool : this also is vanity .
surely oppression maketh a wise man mad ; and a gift destroyeth the heart .
and as he talked with him , he went in , and found many that were come together .
and he said unto them , ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a jew to keep company , or come unto one of another nation ; but god hath shewed me that i should not call any man common or unclean .
therefore came i unto you without gainsaying , as soon as i was sent for : i ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me ?
then called he them in , and lodged them . and on the morrow peter went away with them , and certain brethren from joppa accompanied him .
and the morrow after they entered into caesarea . and cornelius waited for them , and had called together his kinsmen and near friends .
and as peter was coming in , cornelius met him , and fell down at his feet , and worshipped him .
arise therefore , and get thee down , and go with them , doubting nothing : for i have sent them .
then peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from cornelius ; and said , behold , i am he whom ye seek : what is the cause wherefore ye are come ?
and they said , cornelius the centurion , a just man , and one that feareth god , and of good report among all the nation of the jews , was warned from god by an holy angel to send for thee into his house , and to hear words of thee .
this only would i learn of you , received ye the spirit by the works of the law , or by the hearing of faith ?
o foolish galatians , who hath bewitched you , that ye should not obey the truth , before whose eyes jesus christ hath been evidently set forth , crucified among you ?
know ye therefore that they which are of faith , the same are the children of abraham .
and the scripture , foreseeing that god would justify the heathen through faith , preached before the gospel unto abraham , saying , in thee shall all nations be blessed .
so then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful abraham .
are ye so foolish ? having begun in the spirit , are ye now made perfect by the flesh ?
immediately therefore i sent to thee ; and thou hast well done that thou art come . now therefore are we all here present before god , to hear all things that are commanded thee of god .
and he said unto them , he that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
have ye suffered so many things in vain ? if it be yet in vain .
send therefore to joppa , and call hither simon , whose surname is peter ; he is lodged in the house of one simon a tanner by the sea side : who , when he cometh , shall speak unto thee .
and other fell on good ground , and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased ; and brought forth , some thirty , and some sixty , and some an hundred .
he therefore that ministereth to you the spirit , and worketh miracles among you , doeth he it by the works of the law , or by the hearing of faith ?
and said , cornelius , thy prayer is heard , and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of god .
and some fell among thorns , and the thorns grew up , and choked it , and it yielded no fruit .
even as abraham believed god , and it was accounted to him for righteousness .
but when the sun was up , it was scorched ; and because it had no root , it withered away .
the word which god sent unto the children of israel , preaching peace by jesus christ : ( he is lord of all : )
but in every nation he that feareth him , and worketh righteousness , is accepted with him .
then peter opened his mouth , and said , of a truth i perceive that god is no respecter of persons :
and we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the jews , and in jerusalem ; whom they slew and hanged on a tree :
paul , a prisoner of jesus christ , and timothy our brother , unto philemon our dearly beloved , and fellowlabourer ,
him god raised up the third day , and shewed him openly ;
and he commanded us to preach unto the people , and to testify that it is he which was ordained of god to be the judge of quick and dead .
not to all the people , but unto witnesses chosen before of god , even to us , who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead .
while peter yet spake these words , the holy ghost fell on all them which heard the word .
to him give all the prophets witness , that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins .
and to our beloved apphia , and archippus our fellowsoldier , and to the church in thy house :
for they heard them speak with tongues , and magnify god . then answered peter ,
grace to you , and peace , from god our father and the lord jesus christ .
and they of the circumcision which believed were astonished , as many as came with peter , because that on the gentiles also was poured out the gift of the holy ghost .
i thank my god , making mention of thee always in my prayers ,
and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the lord . then prayed they him to tarry certain days .
hearing of thy love and faith , which thou hast toward the lord jesus , and toward all saints ;
can any man forbid water , that these should not be baptized , which have received the holy ghost as well as we ?
that the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in christ jesus .
for we have great joy and consolation in thy love , because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee , brother .
wherefore , though i might be much bold in christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient ,
yet for love ' s sake i rather beseech thee , being such an one as paul the aged , and now also a prisoner of jesus christ .
wherefore hanun took david ' s servants , and shaved off the one half of their beards , and cut off their garments in the middle , even to their buttocks , and sent them away .
and the princes of the children of ammon said unto hanun their lord , thinkest thou that david doth honour thy father , that he hath sent comforters unto thee ? hath not david rather sent his servants unto thee , to search the city , and to spy it out , and to overthrow it ?
then said david , i will shew kindness unto hanun the son of nahash , as his father shewed kindness unto me . and david sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father . and david ' s servants came into the land of the children of ammon .
and it came to pass after this , that the king of the children of ammon died , and hanun his son reigned in his stead .
when joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind , he chose of all the choice men of israel , and put them in array against the syrians :
will god hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him ?
for what is the hope of the hypocrite , though he hath gained , when god taketh away his soul ?
when they told it unto david , he sent to meet them , because the men were greatly ashamed : and the king said , tarry at jericho until your beards be grown , and then return .
god forbid that i should justify you : till i die i will not remove mine integrity from me .
and when the children of ammon saw that they stank before david , the children of ammon sent and hired the syrians of beth - rehob , and the syrians of zoba , twenty thousand footmen , and of king maacah a thousand men , and of ish - tob twelve thousand men .
my lips shall not speak wickedness , nor my tongue utter deceit .
and when david heard of it , he sent joab , and all the host of the mighty men .
let mine enemy be as the wicked , and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous .
and the children of ammon came out , and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate : and the syrians of zoba , and of rehob , and ish - tob , and maacah , were by themselves in the field .
my righteousness i hold fast , and will not let it go : my heart shall not reproach me so long as i live .
moreover job continued his parable , and said ,
all the while my breath is in me , and the spirit of god is in my nostrils ;
as god liveth , who hath taken away my judgment ; and the almighty , who hath vexed my soul ;
and he began again to teach by the sea side : and there was gathered unto him a great multitude , so that he entered into a ship , and sat in the sea ; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land .
and he taught them many things by parables , and said unto them in his doctrine ,
hearken ; behold , there went out a sower to sow :
and it came to pass , as he sowed , some fell by the way side , and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up .
and some fell on stony ground , where it had not much earth ; and immediately it sprang up , because it had no depth of earth :
multitudes , multitudes in the valley of decision : for the day of the lord is near in the valley of decision .
they shall walk after the lord : he shall roar like a lion : when he shall roar , then the children shall tremble from the west .
the sun and the moon shall be darkened , and the stars shall withdraw their shining .
the lord also shall roar out of zion , and utter his voice from jerusalem ; and the heavens and the earth shall shake : but the lord will be the hope of his people , and the strength of the children of israel .
so shall ye know that i am the lord your god dwelling in zion , my holy mountain : then shall jerusalem be holy , and there shall no strangers pass through her any more .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the mountains shall drop down new wine , and the hills shall flow with milk , and all the rivers of judah shall flow with waters , and a fountain shall come forth of the house of the lord , and shall water the valley of shittim .
egypt shall be a desolation , and edom shall be a desolate wilderness , for the violence against the children of judah , because they have shed innocent blood in their land .
beat your plowshares into swords , and your pruninghooks into spears : let the weak say , i am strong .
assemble yourselves , and come , all ye heathen , and gather yourselves together round about : thither cause thy mighty ones to come down , o lord .
and moses with the elders of israel commanded the people , saying , keep all the commandments which i command you this day .
let the heathen be wakened , and come up to the valley of jehoshaphat : for there will i sit to judge all the heathen round about .
and it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over jordan unto the land which the lord thy god giveth thee , that thou shalt set thee up great stones , and plaister them with plaister :
therefore it shall be when ye be gone over jordan , that ye shall set up these stones , which i command you this day , in mount ebal , and thou shalt plaister them with plaister .
and thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law , when thou art passed over , that thou mayest go in unto the land which the lord thy god giveth thee , a land that floweth with milk and honey ; as the lord god of thy fathers hath promised thee .
of melicu , jonathan ; of shebaniah , joseph ;
thou shalt build the altar of the lord thy god of whole stones : and thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the lord thy god :
and joiada begat jonathan , and jonathan begat jaddua .
and there shalt thou build an altar unto the lord thy god , an altar of stones : thou shalt not lift up any iron tool upon them .
and in the days of joiakim were priests , the chief of the fathers : of seraiah , meraiah ; of jeremiah , hananiah ;
and thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly .
and thou shalt offer peace offerings , and shalt eat there , and rejoice before the lord thy god .
and jeshua begat joiakim , joiakim also begat eliashib , and eliashib begat joiada ,
and moses and the priests the levites spake unto all israel , saying , take heed , and hearken , o israel ; this day thou art become the people of the lord thy god .
and of joiarib , mattenai ; of jedaiah , uzzi ;
of abijah , zichri ; of miniamin , of moadiah , piltai ;
of bilgah , shammua ; of shemaiah , jehonathan ;
of harim , adna ; of meraioth , helkai ;
of iddo , zechariah ; of ginnethon , meshullam ;
and ye will not come to me , that ye might have life .
now the days of david drew nigh that he should die ; and he charged solomon his son , saying ,
i receive not honour from men .
i go the way of all the earth : be thou strong therefore , and shew thyself a man ;
but i know you , that ye have not the love of god in you .
i am come in my father ' s name , and ye receive me not : if another shall come in his own name , him ye will receive .
do therefore according to thy wisdom , and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace .
and keep the charge of the lord thy god , to walk in his ways , to keep his statutes , and his commandments , and his judgments , and his testimonies , as it is written in the law of moses , that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest , and whithersoever thou turnest thyself :
that the lord may continue his word which he spake concerning me , saying , if thy children take heed to their way , to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul , there shall not fail thee ( said he ) a man on the throne of israel .
but judah shall dwell for ever , and jerusalem from generation to generation .
for i will cleanse their blood that i have not cleansed : for the lord dwelleth in zion .
the levites in the days of eliashib , joiada , and johanan , and jaddua , were recorded chief of the fathers : also the priests , to the reign of darius the persian .
the sons of levi , the chief of the fathers , were written in the book of the chronicles , even until the days of johanan the son of eliashib .
and the chief of the levites : hashabiah , sherebiah , and jeshua the son of kadmiel , with their brethren over against them , to praise and to give thanks , according to the commandment of david the man of god , ward over against ward .
mattaniah , and bakbukiah , obadiah , meshullam , talmon , akkub , were porters keeping the ward at the thresholds of the gates .
of sallai , kallai ; of amok , eber ;
of hilkiah , hashabiah ; of jedaiah , nethaneel .
now therefore hold him not guiltless : for thou art a wise man , and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him ; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood .
and at the south side four thousand and five hundred measures : and three gates ; one gate of simeon , one gate of issachar , one gate of zebulun .
but shew kindness unto the sons of barzillai the gileadite , and let them be of those that eat at thy table : for so they came to me when i fled because of absalom thy brother .
it was round about eighteen thousand measures : and the name of the city from that day shall be , the lord is there .
do not think that i will accuse you to the father : there is one that accuseth you , even moses , in whom ye trust .
these were in the days of joiakim the son of jeshua , the son of jozadak , and in the days of nehemiah the governor , and of ezra the priest , the scribe .
ephraim compasseth me about with lies , and the house of israel with deceit : but judah yet ruleth with god , and is faithful with the saints .
how can ye believe , which receive honour one of another , and seek not the honour that cometh from god only ?
and at the dedication of the wall of jerusalem they sought the levites out of all their places , to bring them to jerusalem , to keep the dedication with gladness , both with thanksgivings , and with singing , with cymbals , psalteries , and with harps .
they shall tremble as a bird out of egypt , and as a dove out of the land of assyria : and i will place them in their houses , saith the lord .
but if ye believe not his writings , how shall ye believe my words ?
and the sons of the singers gathered themselves together , both out of the plain country round about jerusalem , and from the villages of netophathi ;
for had ye believed moses , ye would have believed me : for he wrote of me .
also from the house of gilgal , and out of the fields of geba and azmaveth : for the singers had builded them villages round about jerusalem .
associate yourselves , o ye people , and ye shall be broken in pieces ; and give ear , all ye of far countries : gird yourselves , and ye shall be broken in pieces ; gird yourselves , and ye shall be broken in pieces .
and the gates of the city shall be after the names of the tribes of israel : three gates northward ; one gate of reuben , one gate of judah , one gate of levi .
and at the east side four thousand and five hundred : and three gates ; and one gate of joseph , one gate of benjamin , one gate of dan .
and these are the goings out of the city on the north side , four thousand and five hundred measures .
if i bear witness of myself , my witness is not true .
and thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old , even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver , after the shekel of the sanctuary .
there is another that beareth witness of me ; and i know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true .
speak unto the children of israel , and say unto them , when a man shall make a singular vow , the persons shall be for the lord by thy estimation .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
i can of mine own self do nothing : as i hear , i judge : and my judgment is just ; because i seek not mine own will , but the will of the father which hath sent me .
and if it be from sixty years old and above ; if it be a male , then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels , and for the female ten shekels .
and if it be from a month old even unto five years old , then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver , and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver .
and if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old , then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels , and for the female ten shekels .
and if it be a female , then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels .
and if it be a beast , whereof men bring an offering unto the lord , all that any man giveth of such unto the lord shall be holy .
but if he be poorer than thy estimation , then he shall present himself before the priest , and the priest shall value him ; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him .
and they rose up early on the morrow , and offered burnt offerings , and brought peace offerings ; and the people sat down to eat and to drink , and rose up to play .
and when aaron saw it , he built an altar before it ; and aaron made proclamation , and said , to morrow is a feast to the lord .
they have turned aside quickly out of the way which i commanded them : they have made them a molten calf , and have worshipped it , and have sacrificed thereunto , and said , these be thy gods , o israel , which have brought thee up out of the land of egypt .
and the lord said unto moses , go , get thee down ; for thy people , which thou broughtest out of the land of egypt , have corrupted themselves :
and aaron said unto them , break off the golden earrings , which are in the ears of your wives , of your sons , and of your daughters , and bring them unto me .
and he received them at their hand , and fashioned it with a graving tool , after he had made it a molten calf : and they said , these be thy gods , o israel , which brought thee up out of the land of egypt .
and all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears , and brought them unto aaron .
but i have greater witness than that of john : for the works which the father hath given me to finish , the same works that i do , bear witness of me , that the father hath sent me .

ye sent unto john , and he bare witness unto the truth .
and by the border of issachar , from the east side unto the west side , zebulun a portion .

and by the border of benjamin , from the east side unto the west side , simeon shall have a portion .
and ye have not his word abiding in you : for whom he hath sent , him ye believe not .
as for the rest of the tribes , from the east side unto the west side , benjamin shall have a portion .
and the father himself , which hath sent me , hath borne witness of me . ye have neither heard his voice at any time , nor seen his shape .
moreover from the possession of the levites , and from the possession of the city , being in the midst of that which is the prince ' s , between the border of judah and the border of benjamin , shall be for the prince .
all the oblation shall be five and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand : ye shall offer the holy oblation foursquare , with the possession of the city .
for the father loveth the son , and sheweth him all things that himself doeth : and he will shew him greater works than these , that ye may marvel .
for as the father raiseth up the dead , and quickeneth them ; even so the son quickeneth whom he will .
and they that serve the city shall serve it out of all the tribes of israel .
that all men should honour the son , even as they honour the father . he that honoureth not the son honoureth not the father which hath sent him .
for before the child shall have knowledge to cry , my father , and my mother , the riches of damascus and the spoil of samaria shall be taken away before the king of assyria .
and these shall be the measures thereof ; the north side four thousand and five hundred , and the south side four thousand and five hundred , and on the east side four thousand and five hundred , and the west side four thousand and five hundred .
for the father judgeth no man , but hath committed all judgment unto the son :
and i went unto the prophetess ; and she conceived , and bare a son . then said the lord to me , call his name maher - shalal - hash - baz .
and the five thousand , that are left in the breadth over against the five and twenty thousand , shall be a profane place for the city , for dwelling , and for suburbs : and the city shall be in the midst thereof .
verily , verily , i say unto you , the hour is coming , and now is , when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of god : and they that hear shall live .
and i took unto me faithful witnesses to record , uriah the priest , and zechariah the son of jeberechiah .
and the residue in length over against the oblation of the holy portion shall be ten thousand eastward , and ten thousand westward : and it shall be over against the oblation of the holy portion ; and the increase thereof shall be for food unto them that serve the city .
verily , verily , i say unto you , he that heareth my word , and believeth on him that sent me , hath everlasting life , and shall not come into condemnation ; but is passed from death unto life .
moreover the lord said unto me , take thee a great roll , and write in it with a man ' s pen concerning maher - shalal - hash - baz .
and the suburbs of the city shall be toward the north two hundred and fifty , and toward the south two hundred and fifty , and toward the east two hundred and fifty , and toward the west two hundred and fifty .
and he shall pass through judah ; he shall overflow and go over , he shall reach even to the neck ; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land , o immanuel .
and this oblation of the land that is offered shall be unto them a thing most holy by the border of the levites .
for as the father hath life in himself ; so hath he given to the son to have life in himself ;
now therefore , behold , the lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river , strong and many , even the king of assyria , and all his glory : and he shall come up over all his channels , and go over all his banks :
it shall be for the priests that are sanctified of the sons of zadok ; which have kept my charge , which went not astray when the children of israel went astray , as the levites went astray .
and shall come forth ; they that have done good , unto the resurrection of life ; and they that have done evil , unto the resurrection of damnation .
forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of shiloah that go softly , and rejoice in rezin and remaliah ' s son ;
and they shall not sell of it , neither exchange , nor alienate the firstfruits of the land : for it is holy unto the lord .
marvel not at this : for the hour is coming , in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice ,
the lord spake also unto me again , saying ,
and over against the border of the priests the levites shall have five and twenty thousand in length , and ten thousand in breadth : all the length shall be five and twenty thousand , and the breadth ten thousand .
for where envying and strife is , there is confusion and every evil work .
and since the time that i commanded judges to be over my people israel . moreover i will subdue all thine enemies . furthermore i tell thee that the lord will build thee an house .
and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace .
can the fig tree , my brethren , bear olive berries ? either a vine , figs ? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh .

i will be his father , and he shall be my son : and i will not take my mercy away from him , as i took it from him that was before thee :
and great multitudes followed him ; and he healed them there .
but if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts , glory not , and lie not against the truth .
he shall build me an house , and i will stablish his throne for ever .
and it came to pass , that when jesus had finished these sayings , he departed from galilee , and came into the coasts of judaea beyond jordan ;
and it shall come to pass , when thy days be expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers , that i will raise up thy seed after thee , which shall be of thy sons ; and i will establish his kingdom .
what can david speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant ? for thou knowest thy servant .
they say unto him , why did moses then command to give a writing of divorcement , and to put her away ?
and yet this was a small thing in thine eyes , o god ; for thou hast also spoken of thy servant ' s house for a great while to come , and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree , o lord god .
wherefore they are no more twain , but one flesh . what therefore god hath joined together , let not man put asunder .
and david the king came and sat before the lord , and said , who am i , o lord god , and what is mine house , that thou hast brought me hitherto ?
and said , for this cause shall a man leave father and mother , and shall cleave to his wife : and they twain shall be one flesh ?
according to all these words , and according to all this vision , so did nathan speak unto david .
and he answered and said unto them , have ye not read , that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female ,
and i say unto you , whosoever shall put away his wife , except it be for fornication , and shall marry another , committeth adultery : and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery .
o lord , for thy servant ' s sake , and according to thine own heart , hast thou done all this greatness , in making known all these great things .
he saith unto them , moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives : but from the beginning it was not so .
and thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight , twenty shekels a day : from time to time shalt thou eat it .
then said i , ah lord god ! behold , my soul hath not been polluted : for from my youth up even till now have i not eaten of that which dieth of itself , or is torn in pieces ; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth .
thou shalt drink also water by measure , the sixth part of an hin : from time to time shalt thou drink .
and thou shalt eat it as barley cakes , and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man , in their sight .
that they may want bread and water , and be astonied one with another , and consume away for their iniquity .
then he said unto me , lo , i have given thee cow ' s dung for man ' s dung , and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith .
moreover he said unto me , son of man , behold , i will break the staff of bread in jerusalem : and they shall eat bread by weight , and with care ; and they shall drink water by measure , and with astonishment :
and what one nation in the earth is like thy people israel , whom god went to redeem to be his own people , to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness , by driving out nations from before thy people , whom thou hast redeemed out of egypt ?
o lord , there is none like thee , neither is there any god beside thee , according to all that we have heard with our ears .
for thy people israel didst thou make thine own people for ever ; and thou , lord , becamest their god .
for thou , o my god , hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house : therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee .
let it even be established , that thy name may be magnified for ever , saying , the lord of hosts is the god of israel , even a god to israel : and let the house of david thy servant be established before thee .
now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant , that it may be before thee for ever : for thou blessest , o lord , and it shall be blessed for ever .
and now , lord , thou art god , and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant :
therefore shall the strong people glorify thee , the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee .
for thou hast made of a city an heap ; of a defenced city a ruin : a palace of strangers to be no city ; it shall never be built .
o lord , thou art my god ; i will exalt thee , i will praise thy name ; for thou hast done wonderful things ; thy counsels of old are faithfulness and truth .
and in this mountain shall the lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things , a feast of wines on the lees , of fat things full of marrow , of wines on the lees well refined .
thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers , as the heat in a dry place ; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud : the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low .
for thou hast been a strength to the poor , a strength to the needy in his distress , a refuge from the storm , a shadow from the heat , when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall .
he will swallow up death in victory ; and the lord god will wipe away tears from off all faces ; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth : for the lord hath spoken it .

then cried he upon me , and spake unto me , saying , behold , these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country .
and the word of the lord came unto me , saying ,
the black horses which are therein go forth into the north country ; and the white go forth after them ; and the grisled go forth toward the south country .
and the bay went forth , and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth : and he said , get you hence , walk to and fro through the earth . so they walked to and fro through the earth .
then i answered and said unto the angel that talked with me , what are these , my lord ?
and the angel answered and said unto me , these are the four spirits of the heavens , which go forth from standing before the lord of all the earth .
in the first chariot were red horses ; and in the second chariot black horses ;
and in the third chariot white horses ; and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses .
and i turned , and lifted up mine eyes , and looked , and , behold , there came four chariots out from between two mountains ; and the mountains were mountains of brass .
the full soul loatheth an honeycomb ; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet .
faithful are the wounds of a friend ; but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful .

and take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten , and thou shalt gather it to thee ; and it shall be for food for thee , and for them .
of fowls after their kind , and of cattle after their kind , of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind , two of every sort shall come unto thee , to keep them alive .

and lest , when i come again , my god will humble me among you , and that i shall bewail many which have sinned already , and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed .
now pashur the son of immer the priest , who was also chief governor in the house of the lord , heard that jeremiah prophesied these things .
then pashur smote jeremiah the prophet , and put him in the stocks that were in the high gate of benjamin , which was by the house of the lord .
and it came to pass on the morrow , that pashur brought forth jeremiah out of the stocks . then said jeremiah unto him , the lord hath not called thy name pashur , but magor - missabib .
for i fear , lest , when i come , i shall not find you such as i would , and that i shall be found unto you such as ye would not : lest there be debates , envyings , wraths , strifes , backbitings , whisperings , swellings , tumults :
then i said , i will not make mention of him , nor speak any more in his name . but his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones , and i was weary with forbearing , and i could not stay .
moreover i will deliver all the strength of this city , and all the labours thereof , and all the precious things thereof , and all the treasures of the kings of judah will i give into the hand of their enemies , which shall spoil them , and take them , and carry them to babylon .
and thou , pashur , and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity : and thou shalt come to babylon , and there thou shalt die , and shalt be buried there , thou , and all thy friends , to whom thou hast prophesied lies .
o lord , thou hast deceived me , and i was deceived : thou art stronger than i , and hast prevailed : i am in derision daily , every one mocketh me .
for since i spake , i cried out , i cried violence and spoil ; because the word of the lord was made a reproach unto me , and a derision , daily .
he answered them , he that made me whole , the same said unto me , take up thy bed , and walk .
then asked they him , what man is that which said unto thee , take up thy bed , and walk ?
and he that was healed wist not who it was : for jesus had conveyed himself away , a multitude being in that place .
afterward jesus findeth him in the temple , and said unto him , behold , thou art made whole : sin no more , lest a worse thing come unto thee .
the man departed , and told the jews that it was jesus , which had made him whole .
and therefore did the jews persecute jesus , and sought to slay him , because he had done these things on the sabbath day .
but jesus answered them , my father worketh hitherto , and i work .
therefore the jews sought the more to kill him , because he not only had broken the sabbath , but said also that god was his father , making himself equal with god .
then answered jesus and said unto them , verily , verily , i say unto you , the son can do nothing of himself , but what he seeth the father do : for what things soever he doeth , these also doeth the son likewise .
and he pressed upon them greatly ; and they turned in unto him , and entered into his house ; and he made them a feast , and did bake unleavened bread , and they did eat .
and there came two angels to sodom at even ; and lot sat in the gate of sodom : and lot seeing them rose up to meet them ; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground ;
and they said , stand back . and they said again , this one fellow came in to sojourn , and he will needs be a judge : now will we deal worse with thee , than with them . and they pressed sore upon the man , even lot , and came near to break the door .
behold now , i have two daughters which have not known man ; let me , i pray you , bring them out unto you , and do ye to them as is good in your eyes : only unto these men do nothing ; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof .
and said , i pray you , brethren , do not so wickedly .
and lot went out at the door unto them , and shut the door after him ,
the jews therefore said unto him that was cured , it is the sabbath day : it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed .
and they called unto lot , and said unto him , where are the men which came in to thee this night ? bring them out unto us , that we may know them .
then asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the lord and of the king ' s house , and sent to ben - hadad king of syria , that dwelt at damascus , saying ,
there is a league between me and thee , as there was between my father and thy father : behold , i have sent thee silver and gold ; go , break thy league with baasha king of israel , that he may depart from me .
and ben - hadad hearkened unto king asa , and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of israel ; and they smote ijon , and dan , and abel - maim , and all the store cities of naphtali .
and it came to pass , when baasha heard it , that he left off building of ramah , and let his work cease .
i desired titus , and with him i sent a brother . did titus make a gain of you ? walked we not in the same spirit ? walked we not in the same steps ?
again , think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you ? we speak before god in christ : but we do all things , dearly beloved , for your edifying .
in the six and thirtieth year of the reign of asa baasha king of israel came up against judah , and built ramah , to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to asa king of judah .
but be it so , i did not burden you : nevertheless , being crafty , i caught you with guile .
did i make a gain of you by any of them whom i sent unto you ?
behold , the third time i am ready to come to you ; and i will not be burdensome to you : for i seek not yours , but you : for the children ought not to lay up for the parents , but the parents for the children .
and i will very gladly spend and be spent for you ; though the more abundantly i love you , the less i be loved .
truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience , in signs , and wonders , and mighty deeds .
for what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches , except it be that i myself was not burdensome to you ? forgive me this wrong .
therefore i take pleasure in infirmities , in reproaches , in necessities , in persecutions , in distresses for christ ' s sake : for when i am weak , then am i strong .
i am become a fool in glorying ; ye have compelled me : for i ought to have been commended of you : for in nothing am i behind the very chiefest apostles , though i be nothing .
and at that time hanani the seer came to asa king of judah , and said unto him , because thou hast relied on the king of syria , and not relied on the lord thy god , therefore is the host of the king of syria escaped out of thine hand .
then asa the king took all judah ; and they carried away the stones of ramah , and the timber thereof , wherewith baasha was building ; and he built therewith geba and mizpah .
for the eyes of the lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth , to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him . herein thou hast done foolishly : therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars .
were not the ethiopians and the lubims a huge host , with very many chariots and horsemen ? yet , because thou didst rely on the lord , he delivered them into thine hand .
o lord god of hosts , hear my prayer : give ear , o god of jacob . selah .
behold , o god our shield , and look upon the face of thine anointed .
who passing through the valley of baca make it a well ; the rain also filleth the pools .
they go from strength to strength , every one of them in zion appeareth before god .

cursed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this law to do them . and all the people shall say , amen .
cursed be he that lieth with his mother in law . and all the people shall say , amen .
cursed be he that smiteth his neighbour secretly . and all the people shall say , amen .
cursed be he that lieth with any manner of beast . and all the people shall say , amen .
cursed be he that lieth with his sister , the daughter of his father , or the daughter of his mother . and all the people shall say , amen .
cursed be he that lieth with his father ' s wife ; because he uncovereth his father ' s skirt . and all the people shall say , amen .
how amiable are thy tabernacles , o lord of hosts !
yea , the sparrow hath found an house , and the swallow a nest for herself , where she may lay her young , even thine altars , o lord of hosts , my king , and my god .
my soul longeth , yea , even fainteth for the courts of the lord : my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living god .
blessed is the man whose strength is in thee ; in whose heart are the ways of them .
blessed are they that dwell in thy house : they will be still praising thee . selah .
i poured out my complaint before him ; i shewed before him my trouble .
i cried unto the lord with my voice ; with my voice unto the lord did i make my supplication .
i looked on my right hand , and beheld , but there was no man that would know me : refuge failed me ; no man cared for my soul .
when my spirit was overwhelmed within me , then thou knewest my path . in the way wherein i walked have they privily laid a snare for me .
attend unto my cry ; for i am brought very low : deliver me from my persecutors ; for they are stronger than i .
i cried unto thee , o lord : i said , thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living .
bring my soul out of prison , that i may praise thy name : the righteous shall compass me about ; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me .
howbeit i sent unto you all my servants the prophets , rising early and sending them , saying , oh , do not this abominable thing that i hate .
because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger , in that they went to burn incense , and to serve other gods , whom they knew not , neither they , ye , nor your fathers .
wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth , and was kindled in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem ; and they are wasted and desolate , as at this day .
but they hearkened not , nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness , to burn no incense unto other gods .
in that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands , burning incense unto other gods in the land of egypt , whither ye be gone to dwell , that ye might cut yourselves off , and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth ?
therefore now this saith the lord , the god of hosts , the god of israel ; wherefore commit ye this great evil against your souls , to cut off from you man and woman , child and suckling , out of judah , to leave you none to remain ;
have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers , and the wickedness of the kings of judah , and the wickedness of their wives , and your own wickedness , and the wickedness of your wives , which they have committed in the land of judah , and in the streets of jerusalem ?
thus saith the lord of hosts , the god of israel ; ye have seen all the evil that i have brought upon jerusalem , and upon all the cities of judah ; and , behold , this day they are a desolation , and no man dwelleth therein ,
the word that came to jeremiah concerning all the jews which dwell in the land of egypt , which dwell at migdol , and at tahpanhes , and at noph , and in the country of pathros , saying ,
for the wave breast and the heave shoulder have i taken of the children of israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings , and have given them unto aaron the priest and unto his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of israel .
which the lord commanded to be given them of the children of israel , in the day that he anointed them , by a statute for ever throughout their generations .
this is the portion of the anointing of aaron , and of the anointing of his sons , out of the offerings of the lord made by fire , in the day when he presented them to minister unto the lord in the priest ' s office ;
his own hands shall bring the offerings of the lord made by fire , the fat with the breast , it shall he bring , that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the lord .
and the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings .
and the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar : but the breast shall be aaron ' s and his sons ' .
which the lord commanded moses in mount sinai , in the day that he commanded the children of israel to offer their oblations unto the lord , in the wilderness of sinai .
this is the law of the burnt offering , of the meat offering , and of the sin offering , and of the trespass offering , and of the consecrations , and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings ;
and , behold , i , even i , do bring a flood of waters upon the earth , to destroy all flesh , wherein is the breath of life , from under heaven ; and every thing that is in the earth shall die .
but with thee will i establish my covenant ; and thou shalt come into the ark , thou , and thy sons , and thy wife , and thy sons ' wives with thee .
and of every living thing of all flesh , two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark , to keep them alive with thee ; they shall be male and female .
and noah begat three sons , shem , ham , and japheth .
the earth also was corrupt before god , and the earth was filled with violence .
and god looked upon the earth , and , behold , it was corrupt ; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth .
and god said unto noah , the end of all flesh is come before me ; for the earth is filled with violence through them ; and , behold , i will destroy them with the earth .
make thee an ark of gopher wood ; rooms shalt thou make in the ark , and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch .
and this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of : the length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits , the breadth of it fifty cubits , and the height of it thirty cubits .
a window shalt thou make to the ark , and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above ; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof ; with lower , second , and third stories shalt thou make it .
cursed be he that removeth his neighbour ' s landmark . and all the people shall say , amen .
cursed be he that setteth light by his father or his mother . and all the people shall say , amen .
cursed be he that perverteth the judgment of the stranger , fatherless , and widow . and all the people shall say , amen .
cursed be he that maketh the blind to wander out of the way . and all the people shall say , amen .
and moses charged the people the same day , saying ,
thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the lord thy god , and do his commandments and his statutes , which i command thee this day .
and these shall stand upon mount ebal to curse ; reuben , gad , and asher , and zebulun , dan , and naphtali .
these shall stand upon mount gerizim to bless the people , when ye are come over jordan ; simeon , and levi , and judah , and issachar , and joseph , and benjamin :
cursed be the man that maketh any graven or molten image , an abomination unto the lord , the work of the hands of the craftsman , and putteth it in a secret place . and all the people shall answer and say , amen .
and the levites shall speak , and say unto all the men of israel with a loud voice ,
and every meat offering , mingled with oil , and dry , shall all the sons of aaron have , one as much as another .
if he offer it for a thanksgiving , then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil , and unleavened wafers anointed with oil , and cakes mingled with oil , of fine flour , fried .
and this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings , which he shall offer unto the lord .
and of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an heave offering unto the lord , and it shall be the priest ' s that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings .
besides the cakes , he shall offer for his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings .
but if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow , or a voluntary offering , it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice : and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten :
and the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered ; he shall not leave any of it until the morning .
and if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day , it shall not be accepted , neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it : it shall be an abomination , and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity .
but the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire .
moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing , as the uncleanness of man , or any unclean beast , or any abominable unclean thing , and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings , which pertain unto the lord , even that soul shall be cut off from his people .
but the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings , that pertain unto the lord , having his uncleanness upon him , even that soul shall be cut off from his people .
for whosoever eateth the fat of the beast , of which men offer an offering made by fire unto the lord , even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people .
and the fat of the beast that dieth of itself , and the fat of that which is torn with beasts , may be used in any other use : but ye shall in no wise eat of it .
speak unto the children of israel , saying , ye shall eat no manner of fat , of ox , or of sheep , or of goat .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
speak unto the children of israel , saying , he that offereth the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the lord shall bring his oblation unto the lord of the sacrifice of his peace offerings .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood , even that soul shall be cut off from his people .
moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood , whether it be of fowl or of beast , in any of your dwellings .
the son of geber , in ramoth - gilead ; to him pertained the towns of jair the son of manasseh , which are in gilead ; to him also pertained the region of argob , which is in bashan , threescore great cities with walls and brasen bars :
baana the son of ahilud ; to him pertained taanach and megiddo , and all beth - shean , which is by zartanah beneath jezreel , from beth - shean to abel - meholah , even unto the place that is beyond jokneam :
the son of abinadab , in all the region of dor ; which had taphath the daughter of solomon to wife :
the son of hesed , in aruboth ; to him pertained sochoh , and all the land of hepher :
geber the son of uri was in the country of gilead , in the country of sihon king of the amorites , and of og king of bashan ; and he was the only officer which was in the land .
shimei the son of elah , in benjamin :
jehoshaphat the son of paruah , in issachar :
then fourteen years after i went up again to jerusalem with barnabas , and took titus with me also .
baanah the son of hushai was in asher and in aloth :
and i went up by revelation , and communicated unto them that gospel which i preach among the gentiles , but privately to them which were of reputation , lest by any means i should run , or had run , in vain .
ahimaaz was in naphtali ; he also took basmath the daughter of solomon to wife :
but neither titus , who was with me , being a greek , was compelled to be circumcised :
ahinadab the son of iddo had mahanaim :
to whom we gave place by subjection , no , not for an hour ; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you .
and that because of false brethren unawares brought in , who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in christ jesus , that they might bring us into bondage :
but contrariwise , when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me , as the gospel of the circumcision was unto peter ;
but of these who seemed to be somewhat , ( whatsoever they were , it maketh no matter to me : god accepteth no man ' s person : ) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me :
and when james , cephas , and john , who seemed to be pillars , perceived the grace that was given unto me , they gave to me and barnabas the right hands of fellowship ; that we should go unto the heathen , and they unto the circumcision .
( for he that wrought effectually in peter to the apostleship of the circumcision , the same was mighty in me toward the gentiles : )
what shall we say then that abraham our father , as pertaining to the flesh , hath found ?
for if abraham were justified by works , he hath whereof to glory ; but not before god .
for what saith the scripture ? abraham believed god , and it was counted unto him for righteousness .
and strangers shall stand and feed your flocks , and the sons of the alien shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers .
and they shall build the old wastes , they shall raise up the former desolations , and they shall repair the waste cities , the desolations of many generations .
for your shame ye shall have double ; and for confusion they shall rejoice in their portion : therefore in their land they shall possess the double : everlasting joy shall be unto them .
but ye shall be named the priests of the lord : men shall call you the ministers of our god : ye shall eat the riches of the gentiles , and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves .
the spirit of the lord god is upon me ; because the lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek ; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted , to proclaim liberty to the captives , and the opening of the prison to them that are bound ;
to appoint unto them that mourn in zion , to give unto them beauty for ashes , the oil of joy for mourning , the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness ; that they might be called trees of righteousness , the planting of the lord , that he might be glorified .
to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord , and the day of vengeance of our god ; to comfort all that mourn ;
but to him that worketh not , but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly , his faith is counted for righteousness .
now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace , but of debt .
saying , blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven , and whose sins are covered .
even as david also describeth the blessedness of the man , unto whom god imputeth righteousness without works ,
cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only , or upon the uncircumcision also ? for we say that faith was reckoned to abraham for righteousness .
blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin .
for i the lord love judgment , i hate robbery for burnt offering ; and i will direct their work in truth , and i will make an everlasting covenant with them .
he setteth an end to darkness , and searcheth out all perfection : the stones of darkness , and the shadow of death .
moreover he hath not seen the sun , nor known any thing : this hath more rest than the other .
the flood breaketh out from the inhabitant ; even the waters forgotten of the foot : they are dried up , they are gone away from men .
yea , though he live a thousand years twice told , yet hath he seen no good : do not all go to one place ?
as for the earth , out of it cometh bread : and under it is turned up as it were fire .
all the labour of man is for his mouth , and yet the appetite is not filled .
the stones of it are the place of sapphires : and it hath dust of gold .
for what hath the wise more than the fool ? what hath the poor , that knoweth to walk before the living ?
there is a path which no fowl knoweth , and which the vulture ' s eye hath not seen :
better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire : this is also vanity and vexation of spirit .
the lion ' s whelps have not trodden it , nor the fierce lion passed by it .
he putteth forth his hand upon the rock ; he overturneth the mountains by the roots .
and when he was come out of the ship , immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit ,
and they came over unto the other side of the sea , into the country of the gadarenes .
because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains , and the chains had been plucked asunder by him , and the fetters broken in pieces : neither could any man tame him .
who had his dwelling among the tombs ; and no man could bind him , no , not with chains :
there is an evil which i have seen under the sun , and it is common among men :
a man to whom god hath given riches , wealth , and honour , so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth , yet god giveth him not power to eat thereof , but a stranger eateth it : this is vanity , and it is an evil disease .
surely there is a vein for the silver , and a place for gold where they fine it .
if a man beget an hundred children , and live many years , so that the days of his years be many , and his soul be not filled with good , and also that he have no burial ; i say , that an untimely birth is better than he .
for he cometh in with vanity , and departeth in darkness , and his name shall be covered with darkness .
and also of the son of the bondwoman will i make a nation , because he is thy seed .
and god said unto abraham , let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad , and because of thy bondwoman ; in all that sarah hath said unto thee , hearken unto her voice ; for in isaac shall thy seed be called .
and the thing was very grievous in abraham ' s sight because of his son .
wherefore she said unto abraham , cast out this bondwoman and her son : for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son , even with isaac .
and god opened her eyes , and she saw a well of water ; and she went , and filled the bottle with water , and gave the lad drink .
arise , lift up the lad , and hold him in thine hand ; for i will make him a great nation .
and god heard the voice of the lad ; and the angel of god called hagar out of heaven , and said unto her , what aileth thee , hagar ? fear not ; for god hath heard the voice of the lad where he is .
and she went , and sat her down over against him a good way off , as it were a bowshot : for she said , let me not see the death of the child . and she sat over against him , and lift up her voice , and wept .
and the water was spent in the bottle , and she cast the child under one of the shrubs .
and abraham rose up early in the morning , and took bread , and a bottle of water , and gave it unto hagar , putting it on her shoulder , and the child , and sent her away : and she departed , and wandered in the wilderness of beer - sheba .
in a moment shall they die , and the people shall be troubled at midnight , and pass away : and the mighty shall be taken away without hand .
for his eyes are upon the ways of man , and he seeth all his goings .
and abraham reproved abimelech because of a well of water , which abimelech ' s servants had violently taken away .
and abimelech said , i wot not who hath done this thing : neither didst thou tell me , neither yet heard i of it , but to day .
and abraham took sheep and oxen , and gave them unto abimelech ; and both of them made a covenant .
and abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves .
and abimelech said unto abraham , what mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves ?
for he will not lay upon man more than right ; that he should enter into judgment with god .
for he said unto him , come out of the man , thou unclean spirit .
there is no darkness , nor shadow of death , where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves .
and cried with a loud voice , and said , what have i to do with thee , jesus , thou son of the most high god ? i adjure thee by god , that thou torment me not .
therefore he knoweth their works , and he overturneth them in the night , so that they are destroyed .
but when he saw jesus afar off , he ran and worshipped him ,
and god was with the lad ; and he grew , and dwelt in the wilderness , and became an archer .
he shall break in pieces mighty men without number , and set others in their stead .
and always , night and day , he was in the mountains , and in the tombs , crying , and cutting himself with stones .
and he dwelt in the wilderness of paran : and his mother took him a wife out of the land of egypt .
because they turned back from him , and would not consider any of his ways :
and it came to pass at that time , that abimelech and phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto abraham , saying , god is with thee in all that thou doest :
he striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others ;
now therefore swear unto me here by god that thou wilt not deal falsely with me , nor with my son , nor with my son ' s son : but according to the kindness that i have done unto thee , thou shalt do unto me , and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned .
when he giveth quietness , who then can make trouble ? and when he hideth his face , who then can behold him ? whether it be done against a nation , or against a man only :
and abraham said , i will swear .
so that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him , and he heareth the cry of the afflicted .
and he asked him , what is thy name ? and he answered , saying , my name is legion : for we are many .
surely it is meet to be said unto god , i have borne chastisement , i will not offend any more :
that which i see not teach thou me : if i have done iniquity , i will do no more .
that the hypocrite reign not , lest the people be ensnared .
and he said , for these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand , that they may be a witness unto me , that i have digged this well .
my desire is that job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men .
wherefore he called that place beer - sheba ; because there they sware both of them .
job hath spoken without knowledge , and his words were without wisdom .
let men of understanding tell me , and let a wise man hearken unto me .
should it be according to thy mind ? he will recompense it , whether thou refuse , or whether thou choose ; and not i : therefore speak what thou knowest .
and abraham sojourned in the philistines ' land many days .
thus they made a covenant at beer - sheba : then abimelech rose up , and phichol the chief captain of his host , and they returned into the land of the philistines .
and abraham planted a grove in beer - sheba , and called there on the name of the lord , the everlasting god .
for he addeth rebellion unto his sin , he clappeth his hands among us , and multiplieth his words against god .
and i will send an angel before thee ; and i will drive out the canaanite , the amorite , and the hittite , and the perizzite , the hivite , and the jebusite :
unto a land flowing with milk and honey : for i will not go up in the midst of thee ; for thou art a stiffnecked people : lest i consume thee in the way .
and the lord said unto moses , depart , and go up hence , thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of egypt , unto the land which i sware unto abraham , to isaac , and to jacob , saying , unto thy seed will i give it :
and the children of israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount horeb .
and moses took the tabernacle , and pitched it without the camp , afar off from the camp , and called it the tabernacle of the congregation . and it came to pass , that every one which sought the lord went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation , which was without the camp .
and when the people heard these evil tidings , they mourned : and no man did put on him his ornaments .
for the lord had said unto moses , say unto the children of israel , ye are a stiffnecked people : i will come up into the midst of thee in a moment , and consume thee : therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee , that i may know what to do unto thee .
and solomon ' s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country , and all the wisdom of egypt .
for he was wiser than all men ; than ethan the ezrahite , and heman , and chalcol , and darda , the sons of mahol : and his fame was in all nations round about .
and it came to pass , when moses went out unto the tabernacle , that all the people rose up , and stood every man at his tent door , and looked after moses , until he was gone into the tabernacle .
and it came to pass , as moses entered into the tabernacle , the cloudy pillar descended , and stood at the door of the tabernacle , and the lord talked with moses .
and there came of all people to hear the wisdom of solomon , from all kings of the earth , which had heard of his wisdom .
and he spake three thousand proverbs : and his songs were a thousand and five .
and he spake of trees , from the cedar tree that is in lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall : he spake also of beasts , and of fowl , and of creeping things , and of fishes .
and david sent and inquired after the woman . and one said , is not this bath - sheba , the daughter of eliam , the wife of uriah the hittite ?
and it came to pass in an eveningtide , that david arose from off his bed , and walked upon the roof of the king ' s house : and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself ; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon .
and it came to pass , after the year was expired , at the time when kings go forth to battle , that david sent joab , and his servants with him , and all israel ; and they destroyed the children of ammon , and besieged rabbah . but david tarried still at jerusalem .
and judah and israel dwelt safely , every man under his vine and under his fig tree , from dan even to beer - sheba , all the days of solomon .
and solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots , and twelve thousand horsemen .
therefore hearken unto me , ye men of understanding : far be it from god , that he should do wickedness ; and from the almighty , that he should commit iniquity .
and those officers provided victual for king solomon , and for all that came unto king solomon ' s table , every man in his month : they lacked nothing .
barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where the officers were , every man according to his charge .
and god gave solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much , and largeness of heart , even as the sand that is on the sea shore .
and david sent messengers , and took her ; and she came in unto him , and he lay with her ; for she was purified from her uncleanness : and she returned unto her house .
and the woman conceived , and sent and told david , and said , i am with child .
and david sent to joab , saying , send me uriah the hittite . and joab sent uriah to david .
judah and israel were many , as the sand which is by the sea in multitude , eating and drinking , and making merry .
and when uriah was come unto him , david demanded of him how joab did , and how the people did , and how the war prospered .
and solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the philistines , and unto the border of egypt : they brought presents , and served solomon all the days of his life .
and david said to uriah , go down to thy house , and wash thy feet . and uriah departed out of the king ' s house , and there followed him a mess of meat from the king .
and solomon ' s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour , and threescore measures of meal ,
but uriah slept at the door of the king ' s house with all the servants of his lord , and went not down to his house .
for he had dominion over all the region on this side the river , from tiphsah even to azzah , over all the kings on this side the river : and he had peace on all sides round about him .
how much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes , nor regardeth the rich more than the poor ? for they all are the work of his hands .
shall even he that hateth right govern ? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just ?
if now thou hast understanding , hear this : hearken to the voice of my words .
all flesh shall perish together , and man shall turn again unto dust .
if he set his heart upon man , if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath ;
who hath given him a charge over the earth ? or who hath disposed the whole world ?
yea , surely god will not do wickedly , neither will the almighty pervert judgment .
for the work of a man shall he render unto him , and cause every man to find according to his ways .
and the lord appeared unto him in the plains of mamre : and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day ;
and he lift up his eyes and looked , and , lo , three men stood by him : and when he saw them , he ran to meet them from the tent door , and bowed himself toward the ground ,
and said , my lord , if now i have found favour in thy sight , pass not away , i pray thee , from thy servant :
let a little water , i pray you , be fetched , and wash your feet , and rest yourselves under the tree :
and the lord said to samuel , hearken unto their voice , and make them a king . and samuel said unto the men of israel , go ye every man unto his city .
and samuel heard all the words of the people , and he rehearsed them in the ears of the lord .
and the twenty pillars thereof and their twenty sockets shall be of brass ; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets shall be of silver .
and they said unto him , where is sarah thy wife ? and he said , behold , in the tent .
and likewise for the north side in length there shall be hangings of an hundred cubits long , and his twenty pillars and their twenty sockets of brass ; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver .
the hangings of one side of the gate shall be fifteen cubits : their pillars three , and their sockets three .
and i will fetch a morsel of bread , and comfort ye your hearts ; after that ye shall pass on : for therefore are ye come to your servant . and they said , so do , as thou hast said .
and on the other side shall be hangings fifteen cubits : their pillars three , and their sockets three .
and abraham hastened into the tent unto sarah , and said , make ready quickly three measures of fine meal , knead it , and make cakes upon the hearth .
and for the breadth of the court on the west side shall be hangings of fifty cubits : their pillars ten , and their sockets ten .
and abraham ran unto the herd , and fetcht a calf tender and good , and gave it unto a young man ; and he hasted to dress it .
and the breadth of the court on the east side eastward shall be fifty cubits .
and he took butter , and milk , and the calf which he had dressed , and set it before them ; and he stood by them under the tree , and they did eat .
all the vessels of the tabernacle in all the service thereof , and all the pins thereof , and all the pins of the court , shall be of brass .
all the pillars round about the court shall be filleted with silver ; their hooks shall be of silver , and their sockets of brass .
and for the gate of the court shall be an hanging of twenty cubits , of blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen , wrought with needlework : and their pillars shall be four , and their sockets four .
that we also may be like all the nations ; and that our king may judge us , and go out before us , and fight our battles .
which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship , and humility , and neglecting of the body ; not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh .
and the king went to gibeon to sacrifice there ; for that was the great high place : a thousand burnt offerings did solomon offer upon that altar .
which all are to perish with the using ; ) after the commandments and doctrines of men ?
in gibeon the lord appeared to solomon in a dream by night : and god said , ask what i shall give thee .
( touch not ; taste not ; handle not ;
only the people sacrificed in high places , because there was no house built unto the name of the lord , until those days .
wherefore if ye be dead with christ from the rudiments of the world , why , as though living in the world , are ye subject to ordinances ,
and solomon loved the lord , walking in the statutes of david his father : only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places .
and solomon made affinity with pharaoh king of egypt , and took pharaoh ' s daughter , and brought her into the city of david , until he had made an end of building his own house , and the house of the lord , and the wall of jerusalem round about .
give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people , that i may discern between good and bad : for who is able to judge this thy so great a people ?
and thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen , a great people , that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude .
and now , o lord my god , thou hast made thy servant king instead of david my father : and i am but a little child : i know not how to go out or come in .
behold therefore , i will gather thee unto thy fathers , and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace ; and thine eyes shall not see all the evil which i will bring upon this place . and they brought the king word again .
blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us , which was contrary to us , and took it out of the way , nailing it to his cross ;
and you , being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh , hath he quickened together with him , having forgiven you all trespasses ;
let no man therefore judge you in meat , or in drink , or in respect of an holyday , or of the new moon , or of the sabbath days :
and having spoiled principalities and powers , he made a shew of them openly , triumphing over them in it .
let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels , intruding into those things which he hath not seen , vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind ,
which are a shadow of things to come ; but the body is of christ .
and not holding the head , from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered , and knit together , increaseth with the increase of god .
for he bringeth down them that dwell on high ; the lofty city , he layeth it low ; he layeth it low , even to the ground ; he bringeth it even to the dust .
the foot shall tread it down , even the feet of the poor , and the steps of the needy .
and they taught in judah , and had the book of the law of the lord with them , and went about throughout all the cities of judah , and taught the people .
thou wilt keep him in perfect peace , whose mind is stayed on thee : because he trusteth in thee .
trust ye in the lord for ever : for in the lord jehovah is everlasting strength :
and ye are complete in him , which is the head of all principality and power :
also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes , even to ben - hail , and to obadiah , and to zechariah , and to nethaneel , and to michaiah , to teach in the cities of judah .
the lord sent a word into jacob , and it hath lighted upon israel .
in that day shall this song be sung in the land of judah ; we have a strong city ; salvation will god appoint for walls and bulwarks .
and with them he sent levites , even shemaiah , and nethaniah , and zebadiah , and asahel , and shemiramoth , and jehonathan , and adonijah , and tobijah , and tob - adonijah , levites ; and with them elishama and jehoram , priests .
and all the people shall know , even ephraim and the inhabitant of samaria , that say in the pride and stoutness of heart ,
open ye the gates , that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in .
buried with him in baptism , wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of god , who hath raised him from the dead .
therefore the lord stablished the kingdom in his hand ; and all judah brought to jehoshaphat presents ; and he had riches and honour in abundance .
in whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands , in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of christ :
and his heart was lifted up in the ways of the lord : moreover he took away the high places and groves out of judah .
but sought to the lord god of his father , and walked in his commandments , and not after the doings of israel .
and the lord was with jehoshaphat , because he walked in the first ways of his father david , and sought not unto baalim ;
and he placed forces in all the fenced cities of judah , and set garrisons in the land of judah , and in the cities of ephraim , which asa his father had taken .
and jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead , and strengthened himself against israel .
and she said unto them , thus saith the lord god of israel , tell the man that sent you to me ,
thus saith the lord , behold , i will bring evil upon this place , and upon the inhabitants thereof , even all the words of the book which the king of judah hath read :
with my soul have i desired thee in the night ; yea , with my spirit within me will i seek thee early : for when thy judgments are in the earth , the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness .
because they have forsaken me , and have burned incense unto other gods , that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands ; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place , and shall not be quenched .
yea , in the way of thy judgments , o lord , have we waited for thee ; the desire of our soul is to thy name , and to the remembrance of thee .
but to the king of judah which sent you to inquire of the lord , thus shall ye say to him , thus saith the lord god of israel , as touching the words which thou hast heard ;
the way of the just is uprightness : thou , most upright , dost weigh the path of the just .
and it came to pass , when the king had heard the words of the book of the law , that he rent his clothes .
and the king commanded hilkiah the priest , and ahikam the son of shaphan , and achbor the son of michaiah , and shaphan the scribe , and asahiah a servant of the king ' s , saying ,
so hilkiah the priest , and ahikam , and achbor , and shaphan , and asahiah , went unto huldah the prophetess , the wife of shallum the son of tikvah , the son of harhas , keeper of the wardrobe ; ( now she dwelt in jerusalem in the college ; ) and they communed with her .
and shaphan the scribe shewed the king , saying , hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book . and shaphan read it before the king .
of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end , upon the throne of david , and upon his kingdom , to order it , and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever . the zeal of the lord of hosts will perform this .
and i said , what is it ? and he said , this is an ephah that goeth forth . he said moreover , this is their resemblance through all the earth .
for unto us a child is born , unto us a son is given : and the government shall be upon his shoulder : and his name shall be called wonderful , counseller , the mighty god , the everlasting father , the prince of peace .
then the angel that talked with me went forth , and said unto me , lift up now thine eyes , and see what is this that goeth forth .
i will bring it forth , saith the lord of hosts , and it shall enter into the house of the thief , and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name : and it shall remain in the midst of his house , and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof .
for thou hast broken the yoke of his burden , and the staff of his shoulder , the rod of his oppressor , as in the day of midian .
then said he unto me , this is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth : for every one that stealeth shall be cut off as on this side according to it ; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off as on that side according to it .
thou hast multiplied the nation , and not increased the joy : they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest , and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil .
the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light : they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death , upon them hath the light shined .
then lifted i up mine eyes , and looked , and , behold , there came out two women , and the wind was in their wings ; for they had wings like the wings of a stork : and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven .
nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation , when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of zebulun and the land of naphtali , and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea , beyond jordan , in galilee of the nations .
and he said , this is wickedness . and he cast it into the midst of the ephah ; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof .
and , behold , there was lifted up a talent of lead : and this is a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah .
and he said unto me , what seest thou ? and i answered , i see a flying roll ; the length thereof is twenty cubits , and the breadth thereof ten cubits .
then i turned , and lifted up mine eyes , and looked , and behold a flying roll .
and it shall come to pass , if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the lord thy god , to observe and to do all his commandments which i command thee this day , that the lord thy god will set thee on high above all nations of the earth :
blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in , and blessed shalt thou be when thou goest out .
the lord shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face : they shall come out against thee one way , and flee before thee seven ways .
the lord shall command the blessing upon thee in thy storehouses , and in all that thou settest thine hand unto ; and he shall bless thee in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee .
the lord shall establish thee an holy people unto himself , as he hath sworn unto thee , if thou shalt keep the commandments of the lord thy god , and walk in his ways .
and all these blessings shall come on thee , and overtake thee , if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god .
blessed shalt thou be in the city , and blessed shalt thou be in the field .
blessed shall be the fruit of thy body , and the fruit of thy ground , and the fruit of thy cattle , the increase of thy kine , and the flocks of thy sheep .
blessed shall be thy basket and thy store .
and thou shalt command the children of israel , that they bring thee pure oil olive beaten for the light , to cause the lamp to burn always .
in the tabernacle of the congregation without the vail , which is before the testimony , aaron and his sons shall order it from evening to morning before the lord : it shall be a statute for ever unto their generations on the behalf of the children of israel .
the word which came unto jeremiah from the lord , when king zedekiah sent unto him pashur the son of melchiah , and zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest , saying ,
then said jeremiah unto them , thus shall ye say to zedekiah :
and i myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm , even in anger , and in fury , and in great wrath .
thus saith the lord god of israel ; behold , i will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands , wherewith ye fight against the king of babylon , and against the chaldeans , which besiege you without the walls , and i will assemble them into the midst of this city .
and i will smite the inhabitants of this city , both man and beast : they shall die of a great pestilence .
he that abideth in this city shall die by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pestilence : but he that goeth out , and falleth to the chaldeans that besiege you , he shall live , and his life shall be unto him for a prey .
and unto this people thou shalt say , thus saith the lord ; behold , i set before you the way of life , and the way of death .
then king rehoboam sent adoram , who was over the tribute ; and all israel stoned him with stones , that he died . therefore king rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot , to flee to jerusalem .
but as for the children of israel which dwelt in the cities of judah , rehoboam reigned over them .
so israel rebelled against the house of david unto this day .
and spake to them after the counsel of the young men , saying , my father made your yoke heavy , and i will add to your yoke : my father also chastised you with whips , but i will chastise you with scorpions .
and the king answered the people roughly , and forsook the old men ' s counsel that they gave him ;
so jeroboam and all the people came to rehoboam the third day , as the king had appointed , saying , come to me again the third day .
and now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke , i will add to your yoke : my father hath chastised you with whips , but i will chastise you with scorpions .
for god hath concluded them all in unbelief , that he might have mercy upon all .
even so have these also now not believed , that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy .
for as ye in times past have not believed god , yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief :
and he set the one in bethel , and the other put he in dan .
whereupon the king took counsel , and made two calves of gold , and said unto them , it is too much for you to go up to jerusalem : behold thy gods , o israel , which brought thee up out of the land of egypt .
for of him , and through him , and to him , are all things : to whom be glory for ever . amen .
or who hath first given to him , and it shall be recompensed unto him again ?
for who hath known the mind of the lord ? or who hath been his counseller ?
o the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of god ! how unsearchable are his judgments , and his ways past finding out !
speak unto rehoboam , the son of solomon , king of judah , and unto all the house of judah and benjamin , and to the remnant of the people , saying ,
but the word of god came unto shemaiah the man of god , saying ,
and when rehoboam was come to jerusalem , he assembled all the house of judah , with the tribe of benjamin , an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men , which were warriors , to fight against the house of israel , to bring the kingdom again to rehoboam the son of solomon .
and it came to pass , when all israel heard that jeroboam was come again , that they sent and called him unto the congregation , and made him king over all israel : there was none that followed the house of david , but the tribe of judah only .
if this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the lord at jerusalem , then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord , even unto rehoboam king of judah , and they shall kill me , and go again to rehoboam king of judah .
and jeroboam said in his heart , now shall the kingdom return to the house of david :
then jeroboam built shechem in mount ephraim , and dwelt therein ; and went out from thence , and built penuel .
thus saith the lord , ye shall not go up , nor fight against your brethren the children of israel : return every man to his house ; for this thing is from me . they hearkened therefore to the word of the lord , and returned to depart , according to the word of the lord .
and this thing became a sin : for the people went to worship before the one , even unto dan .
for if god spared not the natural branches , take heed lest he also spare not thee .
well ; because of unbelief they were broken off , and thou standest by faith . be not highminded , but fear :
and they also , if they abide not still in unbelief , shall be graffed in : for god is able to graff them in again .
behold therefore the goodness and severity of god : on them which fell , severity ; but toward thee , goodness , if thou continue in his goodness : otherwise thou also shalt be cut off .
for i would not , brethren , that ye should be ignorant of this mystery , lest ye should be wise in your own conceits ; that blindness in part is happened to israel , until the fulness of the gentiles be come in .
for if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature , and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree : how much more shall these , which be the natural branches , be graffed into their own olive tree ?
for this is my covenant unto them , when i shall take away their sins .
and so all israel shall be saved : as it is written , there shall come out of sion the deliverer , and shall turn away ungodliness from jacob :
and he made an house of high places , and made priests of the lowest of the people , which were not of the sons of levi .
for the gifts and calling of god are without repentance .
as concerning the gospel , they are enemies for your sakes : but as touching the election , they are beloved for the fathers ' sakes .
so he offered upon the altar which he had made in bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month , even in the month which he had devised of his own heart ; and ordained a feast unto the children of israel : and he offered upon the altar , and burnt incense .
surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him ; that glory may dwell in our land .
thou wilt say then , the branches were broken off , that i might be graffed in .
and if some of the branches be broken off , and thou , being a wild olive tree , wert graffed in among them , and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree ;
wilt thou not revive us again : that thy people may rejoice in thee ?
boast not against the branches . but if thou boast , thou bearest not the root , but the root thee .
wilt thou be angry with us for ever ? wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations ?
i will hear what god the lord will speak : for he will speak peace unto his people , and to his saints : but let them not turn again to folly .
for if the firstfruit be holy , the lump is also holy : and if the root be holy , so are the branches .
shew us thy mercy , o lord , and grant us thy salvation .
for i speak to you gentiles , inasmuch as i am the apostle of the gentiles , i magnify mine office :
if by any means i may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh , and might save some of them .
i say then , have they stumbled that they should fall ? god forbid : but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the gentiles , for to provoke them to jealousy .
now if the fall of them be the riches of the world , and the diminishing of them the riches of the gentiles ; how much more their fulness ?
let their eyes be darkened , that they may not see , and bow down their back alway .
thou hast taken away all thy wrath : thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger .
turn us , o god of our salvation , and cause thine anger toward us to cease .
lord , thou hast been favourable unto thy land : thou hast brought back the captivity of jacob .
thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people , thou hast covered all their sin . selah .
he that turneth away his ear from hearing the law , even his prayer shall be abomination .
whoso keepeth the law is a wise son : but he that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father .
he that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance , he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor .
evil men understand not judgment : but they that seek the lord understand all things .
better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness , than he that is perverse in his ways , though he be rich .
a poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food .
they that forsake the law praise the wicked : but such as keep the law contend with them .
the wicked flee when no man pursueth : but the righteous are bold as a lion .
for the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof : but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged .
and the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth , and gathered the vine of the earth , and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of god .
and another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven , he also having a sharp sickle .
and ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you ; and the lord will not hear you in that day .
and another angel came out from the altar , which had power over fire ; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle , saying , thrust in thy sharp sickle , and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth ; for her grapes are fully ripe .
nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of samuel ; and they said , nay ; but we will have a king over us ;
and another angel came out of the temple , crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud , thrust in thy sickle , and reap : for the time is come for thee to reap ; for the harvest of the earth is ripe .
and he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth ; and the earth was reaped .
and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me , write , blessed are the dead which die in the lord from henceforth : yea , saith the spirit , that they may rest from their labours ; and their works do follow them .
and he will take your fields , and your vineyards , and your oliveyards , even the best of them , and give them to his servants .
and i looked , and behold a white cloud , and upon the cloud one sat like unto the son of man , having on his head a golden crown , and in his hand a sharp sickle .
and he will take the tenth of your seed , and of your vineyards , and give to his officers , and to his servants .
and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever : and they have no rest day nor night , who worship the beast and his image , and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name .
and he will take your menservants , and your maidservants , and your goodliest young men , and your asses , and put them to his work .
here is the patience of the saints : here are they that keep the commandments of god , and the faith of jesus .
he will take the tenth of your sheep : and ye shall be his servants .
and samuel told all the words of the lord unto the people that asked of him a king .
the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of god , which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation ; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels , and in the presence of the lamb :
and he said , this will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you : he will take your sons , and appoint them for himself , for his chariots , and to be his horsemen ; and some shall run before his chariots .
and he will appoint him captains over thousands , and captains over fifties ; and will set them to ear his ground , and to reap his harvest , and to make his instruments of war , and instruments of his chariots .
and he will take your daughters to be confectionaries , and to be cooks , and to be bakers .
and the winepress was trodden without the city , and blood came out of the winepress , even unto the horse bridles , by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs .
in righteousness shalt thou be established : thou shalt be far from oppression ; for thou shalt not fear : and from terror ; for it shall not come near thee .
and all thy children shall be taught of the lord ; and great shall be the peace of thy children .
and i will make thy windows of agates , and thy gates of carbuncles , and all thy borders of pleasant stones .
o thou afflicted , tossed with tempest , and not comforted , behold , i will lay thy stones with fair colours , and lay thy foundations with sapphires .
the word that jeremiah the prophet spake unto baruch the son of neriah , when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of jeremiah , in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah , saying ,
no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper ; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn . this is the heritage of the servants of the lord , and their righteousness is of me , saith the lord .
behold , they shall surely gather together , but not by me : whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake .
behold , i have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire , and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work ; and i have created the waster to destroy .
thou didst say , woe is me now ! for the lord hath added grief to my sorrow ; i fainted in my sighing , and i find no rest .
thus saith the lord , the god of israel , unto thee , o baruch ;
and seekest thou great things for thyself ? seek them not : for , behold , i will bring evil upon all flesh , saith the lord : but thy life will i give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest .
thus shalt thou say unto him , the lord saith thus ; behold , that which i have built will i break down , and that which i have planted i will pluck up , even this whole land .
is not the lord your god with you ? and hath he not given you rest on every side ? for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand ; and the land is subdued before the lord , and before his people .
david also commanded all the princes of israel to help solomon his son , saying ,
now set your heart and your soul to seek the lord your god ; arise therefore , and build ye the sanctuary of the lord god , to bring the ark of the covenant of the lord , and the holy vessels of god , into the house that is to be built to the name of the lord .
then shalt thou prosper , if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the lord charged moses with concerning israel : be strong , and of good courage ; dread not , nor be dismayed .
now , behold , in my trouble i have prepared for the house of the lord an hundred thousand talents of gold , and a thousand thousand talents of silver ; and of brass and iron without weight ; for it is in abundance : timber also and stone have i prepared ; and thou mayest add thereto .
moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance , hewers and workers of stone and timber , and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work .
of the gold , the silver , and the brass , and the iron , there is no number . arise therefore , and be doing , and the lord be with thee .
he shall build an house for my name ; and he shall be my son , and i will be his father ; and i will establish throne of his kingdom over israel for ever .
now , my son , the lord be with thee ; and prosper thou , and build the house of the lord thy god , as he hath said of thee .
only the lord give thee wisdom and understanding , and give thee charge concerning israel , that thou mayest keep the law of the lord thy god .
lift up thine eyes round about , and behold : all these gather themselves together , and come to thee . as i live , saith the lord , thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all , as with an ornament , and bind them on thee , as a bride doeth .
thy children shall make haste ; thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth of thee .
behold , i have graven thee upon the palms of my hands ; thy walls are continually before me .
but zion said , the lord hath forsaken me , and my lord hath forgotten me .
sing , o heavens ; and be joyful , o earth ; and break forth into singing , o mountains : for the lord hath comforted his people , and will have mercy upon his afflicted .
behold , these shall come from far : and , lo , these from the north and from the west ; and these from the land of sinim .
and i will make all my mountains a way , and my highways shall be exalted .
they shall not hunger nor thirst ; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them : for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them , even by the springs of water shall he guide them .
but thus saith the lord , even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away , and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered : for i will contend with him that contendeth with thee , and i will save thy children .
shall the prey be taken from the mighty , or the lawful captive delivered ?
and i will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh ; and they shall be drunken with their own blood , as with sweet wine : and all flesh shall know that i the lord am thy saviour and thy redeemer , the mighty one of jacob .
then shalt thou say in thine heart , who hath begotten me these , seeing i have lost my children , and am desolate , a captive , and removing to and fro ? and who hath brought up these ? behold , i was left alone ; these , where had they been ?
the children which thou shalt have , after thou hast lost the other , shall say again in thine ears , the place is too strait for me : give place to me that i may dwell .
and kings shall be thy nursing fathers , and their queens thy nursing mothers : they shall bow down to thee with their face toward the earth , and lick up the dust of thy feet ; and thou shalt know that i am the lord : for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me .
thus saith the lord god , behold , i will lift up mine hand to the gentiles , and set up my standard to the people : and they shall bring thy sons in their arms , and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders .
hear my prayer , o lord , give ear to my supplications : in thy faithfulness answer me , and in thy righteousness .
i stretch forth my hands unto thee : my soul thirsteth after thee , as a thirsty land . selah .
hear me speedily , o lord : my spirit faileth : hide not thy face from me , lest i be like unto them that go down into the pit .
cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning ; for in thee do i trust : cause me to know the way wherein i should walk ; for i lift up my soul unto thee .
deliver me , o lord , from mine enemies : i flee unto thee to hide me .
and enter not into judgment with thy servant : for in thy sight shall no man living be justified .
for the enemy hath persecuted my soul ; he hath smitten my life down to the ground ; he hath made me to dwell in darkness , as those that have been long dead .
therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me ; my heart within me is desolate .
i remember the days of old ; i meditate on all thy works ; i muse on the work of thy hands .
but i am poor and needy ; yet the lord thinketh upon me : thou art my help and my deliverer ; make no tarrying , o my god .
be pleased , o lord , to deliver me : o lord , make haste to help me .
let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it ; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil .
let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me , aha , aha .
let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee : let such as love thy salvation say continually , the lord be magnified .
withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me , o lord : let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me .
thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn .
forty stripes he may give him , and not exceed : lest , if he should exceed , and beat him above these with many stripes , then thy brother should seem vile unto thee .
and it shall be , if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten , that the judge shall cause him to lie down , and to be beaten before his face , according to his fault , by a certain number .
if there be a controversy between men , and they come unto judgment , that the judges may judge them ; then they shall justify the righteous , and condemn the wicked .
then the elders of his city shall call him , and speak unto him : and if he stand to it , and say , i like not to take her ;
and it shall be , that the firstborn which she beareth shall succeed in the name of his brother which is dead , that his name be not put out of israel .
then shall his brother ' s wife come unto him in the presence of the elders , and loose his shoe from off his foot , and spit in his face , and shall answer and say , so shall it be done unto that man that will not build up his brother ' s house .
then answered peter and said unto him , declare unto us this parable .
and jesus said , are ye also yet without understanding ?
do not ye yet understand , that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly , and is cast out into the draught ?
but those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart ; and they defile the man .
not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man ; but that which cometh out of the mouth , this defileth a man .
then came his disciples , and said unto him , knowest thou that the pharisees were offended , after they heard this saying ?
but he answered and said , every plant , which my heavenly father hath not planted , shall be rooted up .
let them alone : they be blind leaders of the blind . and if the blind lead the blind , both shall fall into the ditch .
for out of the heart proceed evil thoughts , murders , adulteries , fornications , thefts , false witness , blasphemies :
woe unto them ! for they have fled from me : destruction unto them ! because they have transgressed against me : though i have redeemed them , yet they have spoken lies against me .
when they shall go , i will spread my net upon them ; i will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven ; i will chastise them , as their congregation hath heard .
ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart : they call to egypt , they go to assyria .
and the pride of israel testifieth to his face : and they do not return to the lord their god , nor seek him for all this .
they return , but not to the most high : they are like a deceitful bow : their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue : this shall be their derision in the land of egypt .
though i have bound and strengthened their arms , yet do they imagine mischief against me .
and he called the multitude , and said unto them , hear , and understand :
and they have not cried unto me with their heart , when they howled upon their beds : they assemble themselves for corn and wine , and they rebel against me .
and jesus saith unto them , how many loaves have ye ? and they said , seven , and a few little fishes .
and his disciples say unto him , whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness , as to fill so great a multitude ?
and he took the seven loaves and the fishes , and gave thanks , and brake them , and gave to his disciples , and the disciples to the multitude .
and he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground .
and they that did eat were four thousand men , beside women and children .
and they did all eat , and were filled : and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full .
and he sent away the multitude , and took ship , and came into the coasts of magdala ,
and great multitudes came unto him , having with them those that were lame , blind , dumb , maimed , and many others , and cast them down at jesus ' feet ; and he healed them :
insomuch that the multitude wondered , when they saw the dumb to speak , the maimed to be whole , the lame to walk , and the blind to see : and they glorified the god of israel .
then jesus called his disciples unto him , and said , i have compassion on the multitude , because they continue with me now three days , and have nothing to eat : and i will not send them away fasting , lest they faint in the way .
and amaziah the son of joash king of judah lived after the death of jehoash son of jehoahaz king of israel fifteen years .
and jehoash slept with his fathers , and was buried in samaria with the kings of israel ; and jeroboam his son reigned in his stead .
now the rest of the acts of jehoash which he did , and his might , and how he fought with amaziah king of judah , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel ?
and he took all the gold and silver , and all the vessels that were found in the house of the lord , and in the treasures of the king ' s house , and hostages , and returned to samaria .
and judah was put to the worse before israel ; and they fled every man to their tents .
but amaziah would not hear . therefore jehoash king of israel went up ; and he and amaziah king of judah looked one another in the face at beth - shemesh , which belongeth to judah .
thou hast indeed smitten edom , and thine heart hath lifted thee up : glory of this , and tarry at home : for why shouldest thou meddle to thy hurt , that thou shouldest fall , even thou , and judah with thee ?
then came she and worshipped him , saying , lord , help me .
and , behold , a woman of canaan came out of the same coasts , and cried unto him , saying , have mercy on me , o lord , thou son of david ; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil .
and jesus departed from thence , and came nigh unto the sea of galilee ; and went up into a mountain , and sat down there .
then jesus answered and said unto her , o woman , great is thy faith : be it unto thee even as thou wilt . and her daughter was made whole from that very hour .
now they made a conspiracy against him in jerusalem : and he fled to lachish ; but they sent after him to lachish , and slew him there .
and she said , truth , lord : yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters ' table .
and the rest of the acts of amaziah , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah ?
but he answered and said , it is not meet to take the children ' s bread , and to cast it to dogs .
these are the things which defile a man : but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man .
then jesus went thence , and departed into the coasts of tyre and sidon .
and they brought him on horses : and he was buried at jerusalem with his fathers in the city of david .
moreover job continued his parable , and said ,
when i washed my steps with butter , and the rock poured me out rivers of oil ;
when i went out to the gate through the city , when i prepared my seat in the street !
the young men saw me , and hid themselves : and the aged arose , and stood up .
the princes refrained talking , and laid their hand on their mouth .
oh that i were as in months past , as in the days when god preserved me ;
when his candle shined upon my head , and when by his light i walked through darkness ;
as i was in the days of my youth , when the secret of god was upon my tabernacle ;
when the almighty was yet with me , when my children were about me ;
thus saith the lord of hosts ; let your hands be strong , ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets , which were in the day that the foundation of the house of the lord of hosts was laid , that the temple might be built .
and i will bring them , and they shall dwell in the midst of jerusalem : and they shall be my people , and i will be their god , in truth and in righteousness .
and aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning : when he dresseth the lamps , he shall burn incense upon it .
and when aaron lighteth the lamps at even , he shall burn incense upon it , a perpetual incense before the lord throughout your generations .
ye shall offer no strange incense thereon , nor burnt sacrifice , nor meat offering ; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon .
and thou shalt overlay it with pure gold , the top thereof , and the sides thereof round about , and the horns thereof ; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about .
and two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it , by the two corners thereof , upon the two sides of it shalt thou make it ; and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal .
and thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood , and overlay them with gold .
and thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of the testimony , before the mercy seat that is over the testimony , where i will meet with thee .
and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee , seven times seven years ; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years .
for zion ' s sake will i not hold my peace , and for jerusalem ' s sake i will not rest , until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness , and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth .
then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month , in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land .
and jeroboam slept with his fathers , even with the kings of israel ; and zachariah his son reigned in his stead .
and the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you ; for thee , and for thy servant , and for thy maid , and for thy hired servant , and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee ,
and for thy cattle , and for the beast that are in thy land , shall all the increase thereof be meat .
for as a young man marrieth a virgin , so shall thy sons marry thee : and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride , so shall thy god rejoice over thee .
i have set watchmen upon thy walls , o jerusalem , which shall never hold their peace day nor night : ye that make mention of the lord , keep not silence ,
thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the lord , and a royal diadem in the hand of thy god .
thou shalt no more be termed forsaken ; neither shall thy land any more be termed desolate : but thou shalt be called hephzi - bah , and thy land beulah : for the lord delighteth in thee , and thy land shall be married .
in the fifteenth year of amaziah the son of joash king of judah jeroboam the son of joash king of israel began to reign in samaria , and reigned forty and one years .
but they that have gathered it shall eat it , and praise the lord ; and they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my holiness .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord : he departed not from all the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat , who made israel to sin .
and the lord spake unto moses in mount sinai , saying ,
and all the people of judah took azariah , which was sixteen years old , and made him king instead of his father amaziah .
and give him no rest , till he establish , and till he make jerusalem a praise in the earth .
he built elath , and restored it to judah , after that the king slept with his fathers .
the lord hath sworn by his right hand , and by the arm of his strength , surely i will no more give thy corn to be meat for thine enemies ; and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy wine , for the which thou hast laboured :
and the lord said not that he would blot out the name of israel from under heaven : but he saved them by the hand of jeroboam the son of joash .
but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land , a sabbath for the lord : thou shalt neither sow thy field , nor prune thy vineyard .
now the rest of the acts of jeroboam , and all that he did , and his might , how he warred , and how he recovered damascus , and hamath , which belonged to judah , for israel , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel ?
that which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap , neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed : for it is a year of rest unto the land .
he restored the coast of israel from the entering of hamath unto the sea of the plain , according to the word of the lord god of israel , which he spake by the hand of his servant jonah , the son of amittai , the prophet , which was of gath - hepher .
speak unto the children of israel , and say unto them , when ye come into the land which i give you , then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the lord .
for the lord saw the affliction of israel , that it was very bitter : for there was not any shut up , nor any left , nor any helper for israel .
six years thou shalt sow thy field , and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard , and gather in the fruit thereof ;
then said i , woe is me ! for i am undone ; because i am a man of unclean lips , and i dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips : for mine eyes have seen the king , the lord of hosts .
then flew one of the seraphims unto me , having a live coal in his hand , which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar :
and one cried unto another , and said , holy , holy , holy , is the lord of hosts : the whole earth is full of his glory .
and the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried , and the house was filled with smoke .
moreover the profit of the earth is for all : the king himself is served by the field .
and he said , go , and tell this people , hear ye indeed , but understand not ; and see ye indeed , but perceive not .
if thou seest the oppression of the poor , and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province , marvel not at the matter : for he that is higher than the highest regardeth ; and there be higher than they .
for in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also divers vanities : but fear thou god .
and he laid it upon my mouth , and said , lo , this hath touched thy lips ; and thine iniquity is taken away , and thy sin purged .
suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin ; neither say thou before the angel , that it was an error : wherefore should god be angry at thy voice , and destroy the work of thine hands ?
also i heard the voice of the lord , saying , whom shall i send , and who will go for us ? then said i , here am i ; send me .
better is it that thou shouldest not vow , than that thou shouldest vow and not pay .
when thou vowest a vow unto god , defer not to pay it ; for he hath no pleasure in fools : pay that which thou hast vowed .
for a dream cometh through the multitude of business ; and a fool ' s voice is known by multitude of words .
be not rash with thy mouth , and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before god : for god is in heaven , and thou upon earth : therefore let thy words be few .
but if ye will not make known unto me the dream , there is but one decree for you : for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me , till the time be changed : therefore tell me the dream , and i shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof .
keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of god , and be more ready to hear , than to give the sacrifice of fools : for they consider not that they do evil .
in the year that king uzziah died i saw also the lord sitting upon a throne , high and lifted up , and his train filled the temple .
the king answered and said , i know of certainty that ye would gain the time , because ye see the thing is gone from me .
above it stood the seraphims : each one had six wings ; with twain he covered his face , and with twain he covered his feet , and with twain he did fly .
they answered again and said , let the king tell his servants the dream , and we will shew the interpretation of it .
but if ye shew the dream , and the interpretation thereof , ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour : therefore shew me the dream , and the interpretation thereof .
the king answered and said to the chaldeans , the thing is gone from me : if ye will not make known unto me the dream , with the interpretation thereof , ye shall be cut in pieces , and your houses shall be made a dunghill .
a cubit shall be the length thereof , and a cubit the breadth thereof ; foursquare shall it be : and two cubits shall be the height thereof : the horns thereof shall be of the same .
and the king said unto them , i have dreamed a dream , and my spirit was troubled to know the dream .
and thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon : of shittim wood shalt thou make it .
then spake the chaldeans to the king in syriack , o king , live for ever : tell thy servants the dream , and we will shew the interpretation .
and in the second year of the reign of nebuchadnezzar nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams , wherewith his spirit was troubled , and his sleep brake from him .
then the king commanded to call the magicians , and the astrologers , and the sorcerers , and the chaldeans , for to shew the king his dreams . so they came and stood before the king .
and immediately when jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves , he said unto them , why reason ye these things in your hearts ?
whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy , thy sins be forgiven thee ; or to say , arise , and take up thy bed , and walk ?
by this therefore shall the iniquity of jacob be purged ; and this is all the fruit to take away his sin ; when he maketh all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder , the groves and images shall not stand up .
in measure , when it shooteth forth , thou wilt debate with it : he stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind .
hath he smitten him , as he smote those that smote him ? or is he slain according to the slaughter of them that are slain by him ?
he shall cause them that come of jacob to take root : israel shall blossom and bud , and fill the face of the world with fruit .
and ahab king of israel said unto jehoshaphat king of judah , wilt thou go with me to ramoth - gilead ? and he answered him , i am as thou art , and my people as thy people ; and we will be with thee in the war .
and after certain years he went down to ahab to samaria . and ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance , and for the people that he had with him , and persuaded him to go up with him to ramoth - gilead .
now jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance , and joined affinity with ahab .
but jehoshaphat said , is there not here a prophet of the lord besides , that we might inquire of him ?
in that day the lord with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent , even leviathan that crooked serpent ; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea .
and jehoshaphat said unto the king of israel , inquire , i pray thee , at the word of the lord to day .
and the lord sent nathan unto david . and he came unto him , and said unto him , there were two men in one city ; the one rich , and the other poor .
therefore the king of israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men , and said unto them , shall we go to ramoth - gilead to battle , or shall i forbear ? and they said , go up ; for god will deliver it into the king ' s hand .
the rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds :
fury is not in me : who would set the briers and thorns against me in battle ? i would go through them , i would burn them together .
or let him take hold of my strength , that he may make peace with me ; and he shall make peace with me .
and the king of israel called for one of his officers , and said , fetch quickly micaiah the son of imla .
and the king of israel and jehoshaphat king of judah sat either of them on his throne , clothed in their robes , and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of samaria ; and all the prophets prophesied before them .
i the lord do keep it ; i will water it every moment : lest any hurt it , i will keep it night and day .
and they come unto him , bringing one sick of the palsy , which was borne of four .
and straightway many were gathered together , insomuch that there was no room to receive them , no , not so much as about the door : and he preached the word unto them .
and again he entered into capernaum , after some days ; and it was noised that he was in the house .
why doth this man thus speak blasphemies ? who can forgive sins but god only ?
but there were certain of the scribes sitting there , and reasoning in their hearts ,
when jesus saw their faith , he said unto the sick of the palsy , son , thy sins be forgiven thee .
wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the lord , to do evil in his sight ? thou hast killed uriah the hittite with the sword , and hast taken his wife to be thy wife , and hast slain him with the sword of the children of ammon .
and i gave thee thy master ' s house , and thy master ' s wives into thy bosom , and gave thee the house of israel and of judah ; and if that had been too little , i would moreover have given unto thee such and such things .
and nathan said to david , thou art the man . thus saith the lord god of israel , i anointed thee king over israel , and i delivered thee out of the hand of saul ;
and he shall restore the lamb fourfold , because he did this thing , and because he had no pity .
and david ' s anger was greatly kindled against the man ; and he said to nathan , as the lord liveth , the man that hath done this thing shall surely die :
and there came a traveller unto the rich man , and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd , to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him ; but took the poor man ' s lamb , and dressed it for the man that was come to him .
then the king promoted shadrach , meshach , and abed - nego , in the province of babylon .
for ye suffer fools gladly , seeing ye yourselves are wise .
that which i speak , i speak it not after the lord , but as it were foolishly , in this confidence of boasting .
seeing that many glory after the flesh , i will glory also .
wherefore ? because i love you not ? god knoweth .
for thou , lord , art good , and ready to forgive ; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee .
but what i do , that i will do , that i may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion ; that wherein they glory , they may be found even as we .
rejoice the soul of thy servant : for unto thee , o lord , do i lift up my soul .
in the day of my trouble i will call upon thee : for thou wilt answer me .
as the truth of christ is in me , no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of achaia .
give ear , o lord , unto my prayer ; and attend to the voice of my supplications .
therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness ; whose end shall be according to their works .
all nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee , o lord ; and shall glorify thy name .
i say again , let no man think me a fool ; if otherwise , yet as a fool receive me , that i may boast myself a little .
among the gods there is none like unto thee , o lord ; neither are there any works like unto thy works .
for such are false apostles , deceitful workers , transforming themselves into the apostles of christ .
and no marvel ; for satan himself is transformed into an angel of light .
then nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied , and rose up in haste , and spake , and said unto his counsellers , did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire ? they answered and said unto the king , true , o king .
he answered and said , lo , i see four men loose , walking in the midst of the fire , and they have no hurt ; and the form of the fourth is like the son of god .
therefore because the king ' s commandment was urgent , and the furnace exceeding hot , the flame of the fire slew those men that took up shadrach , meshach , and abed - nego .
and these three men , shadrach , meshach , and abed - nego , fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace .
preserve my soul ; for i am holy : o thou my god , save thy servant that trusteth in thee .
and he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind shadrach , meshach , and abed - nego , and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace .
be merciful unto me , o lord : for i cry unto thee daily .
then these men were bound in their coats , their hosen , and their hats , and their other garments , and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace .
bow down thine ear , o lord , hear me : for i am poor and needy .
and the princes , governors , and captains , and the king ' s counsellers , being gathered together , saw these men , upon whose bodies the fire had no power , nor was an hair of their head singed , neither were their coats changed , nor the smell of fire had passed on them .
beside those things that are without , that which cometh upon me daily , the care of all the churches .
who is weak , and i am not weak ? who is offended , and i burn not ?
are they hebrews ? so am i . are they israelites ? so am i . are they the seed of abraham ? so am i .
are they ministers of christ ? ( i speak as a fool ) i am more ; in labours more abundant , in stripes above measure , in prisons more frequent , in deaths oft .
of the jews five times received i forty stripes save one .
thrice was i beaten with rods , once was i stoned , thrice i suffered shipwreck , a night and a day i have been in the deep ;
in journeyings often , in perils of waters , in perils of robbers , in perils by mine own countrymen , in perils by the heathen , in perils in the city , in perils in the wilderness , in perils in the sea , in perils among false brethren ;
in weariness and painfulness , in watchings often , in hunger and thirst , in fastings often , in cold and nakedness .
o god the lord , the strength of my salvation , thou hast covered my head in the day of battle .
grant not , o lord , the desires of the wicked : further not his wicked device ; lest they exalt themselves . selah .
the proud have hid a snare for me , and cords ; they have spread a net by the wayside ; they have set gins for me . selah .
i said unto the lord , thou art my god : hear the voice of my supplications , o lord .
thou , o king , hast made a decree , that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet , flute , harp , sackbut , psaltery , and dulcimer , and all kinds of musick , shall fall down and worship the golden image :
and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth , that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace .
there are certain jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of babylon , shadrach , meshach , and abed - nego ; these men , o king , have not regarded thee : they serve not thy gods , nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up .
as for the head of those that compass me about , let the mischief of their own lips cover them .
then nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring shadrach , meshach , and abed - nego . then they brought these men before the king .
nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them , is it true , o shadrach , meshach , and abed - nego , do not ye serve my gods , nor worship the golden image which i have set up ?
shadrach , meshach , and abed - nego , answered and said to the king , o nebuchadnezzar , we are not careful to answer thee in this matter .
if it be so , our god whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace , and he will deliver us out of thine hand , o king .
but if not , be it known unto thee , o king , that we will not serve thy gods , nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up .
they have sharpened their tongues like a serpent ; adders ' poison is under their lips . selah .
then was nebuchadnezzar full of fury , and the form of his visage was changed against shadrach , meshach , and abed - nego : therefore he spake , and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated .
keep me , o lord , from the hands of the wicked ; preserve me from the violent man ; who have purposed to overthrow my goings .
deliver me , o lord , from the evil man : preserve me from the violent man ;
which imagine mischiefs in their heart ; continually are they gathered together for war .
he , that being often reproved hardeneth his neck , shall suddenly be destroyed , and that without remedy .
and this was yet a small thing in thy sight , o lord god ; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant ' s house for a great while to come . and is this the manner of man , o lord god ?
then went king david in , and sat before the lord , and he said , who am i , o lord god ? and what is my house , that thou hast brought me hitherto ?
according to all these words , and according to all this vision , so did nathan speak unto david .
the king by judgment establisheth the land : but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it .
and thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee : thy throne shall be established for ever .
a man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet .
but my mercy shall not depart away from him , as i took it from saul , whom i put away before thee .
when the righteous are in authority , the people rejoice : but when the wicked beareth rule , the people mourn .
i will be his father , and he shall be my son . if he commit iniquity , i will chasten him with the rod of men , and with the stripes of the children of men :
whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father : but he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth his substance .
he shall build an house for my name , and i will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever .
scornful men bring a city into a snare : but wise men turn away wrath .
and when thy days be fulfilled , and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers , i will set up thy seed after thee , which shall proceed out of thy bowels , and i will establish his kingdom .
if a wise man contendeth with a foolish man , whether he rage or laugh , there is no rest .
and as since the time that i commanded judges to be over my people israel , and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies . also the lord telleth thee that he will make thee an house .
in the transgression of an evil man there is a snare : but the righteous doth sing and rejoice .
moreover i will appoint a place for my people israel , and will plant them , that they may dwell in a place of their own , and move no more ; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more , as beforetime ,
the righteous considereth the cause of the poor : but the wicked regardeth not to know it .
i wrote unto the church : but diotrephes , who loveth to have the preeminence among them , receiveth us not .
we therefore ought to receive such , that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth .
because that for his name ' s sake they went forth , taking nothing of the gentiles .
beloved , i wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health , even as thy soul prospereth .
the elder unto the wellbeloved gaius , whom i love in the truth .
which have borne witness of thy charity before the church : whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort , thou shalt do well :
beloved , thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren , and to strangers ;
i have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth .
for i rejoiced greatly , when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee , even as thou walkest in the truth .
and many nations shall pass by this city , and they shall say every man to his neighbour , wherefore hath the lord done thus unto this great city ?
and i will prepare destroyers against thee , every one with his weapons : and they shall cut down thy choice cedars , and cast them into the fire .
then they shall answer , because they have forsaken the covenant of the lord their god , and worshipped other gods , and served them .
for if ye do this thing indeed , then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of david , riding in chariots and on horses , he , and his servants , and his people .
thus saith the lord ; execute ye judgment and righteousness , and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor : and do no wrong , do no violence to the stranger , the fatherless , nor the widow , neither shed innocent blood in this place .
for thus saith the lord unto the king ' s house of judah ; thou art gilead unto me , and the head of lebanon : yet surely i will make thee a wilderness , and cities which are not inhabited .
but if ye will not hear these words , i swear by myself , saith the lord , that this house shall become a desolation .
and the king spake unto ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs , that he should bring certain of the children of israel , and of the king ' s seed , and of the princes ;
and the lord gave jehoiakim king of judah into his hand , with part of the vessels of the house of god : which he carried into the land of shinar to the house of his god ; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god .
and say , hear the word of the lord , o king of judah , that sittest upon the throne of david , thou , and thy servants , and thy people that enter in by these gates :
and the king appointed them a daily provision of the king ' s meat , and of the wine which he drank : so nourishing them three years , that at the end thereof they might stand before the king .
thus saith the lord ; go down to the house of the king of judah , and speak there this word ,
children in whom was no blemish , but well favoured , and skilful in all wisdom , and cunning in knowledge , and understanding science , and such as had ability in them to stand in the king ' s palace , and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the chaldeans .
in the third year of the reign of jehoiakim king of judah came nebuchadnezzar king of babylon unto jerusalem , and besieged it .
now among these were of the children of judah , daniel , hananiah , mishael , and azariah :
unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names : for he gave unto daniel the name of belteshazzar ; and to hananiah , of shadrach ; and to mishael , of meshach ; and to azariah , of abed - nego .
now god had brought daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs .
and what can david say more unto thee ? for thou , lord god , knowest thy servant .
for thy word ' s sake , and according to thine own heart , hast thou done all these great things , to make thy servant know them .
wherefore thou art great , o lord god : for there is none like thee , neither is there any god beside thee , according to all that we have heard with our ears .
for thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people israel to be a people unto thee for ever : and thou , lord , art become their god .
and now , o lord god , the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant , and concerning his house , establish it for ever , and do as thou hast said .
and when the disciples heard it , they fell on their face , and were sore afraid .
and let thy name be magnified for ever , saying , the lord of hosts is the god over israel : and let the house of thy servant david be established before thee .
and jesus came and touched them , and said , arise , and be not afraid .
for thou , o lord of hosts , god of israel , hast revealed to thy servant , saying , i will build thee an house : therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee .
and when they had lifted up their eyes , they saw no man , save jesus only .
and now , o lord god , thou art that god , and thy words be true , and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant :
and as they came down from the mountain , jesus charged them , saying , tell the vision to no man , until the son of man be risen again from the dead .
therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant , that it may continue for ever before thee : for thou , o lord god , hast spoken it : and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever .
and was transfigured before them : and his face did shine as the sun , and his raiment was white as the light .
and , behold , there appeared unto them moses and elias talking with him .
then answered peter , and said unto jesus , lord , it is good for us to be here : if thou wilt , let us make here three tabernacles ; one for thee , and one for moses , and one for elias .
while he yet spake , behold , a bright cloud overshadowed them : and behold a voice out of the cloud , which said , this is my beloved son , in whom i am well pleased ; hear ye him .
and after six days jesus taketh peter , james , and john his brother , and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart ,
if i must needs glory , i will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities .
so will i stretch out my hand upon them , and make the land desolate , yea , more desolate than the wilderness toward diblath , in all their habitations : and they shall know that i am the lord .
he that is far off shall die of the pestilence ; and he that is near shall fall by the sword ; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine : thus will i accomplish my fury upon them .
thus saith the lord god ; smite with thine hand , and stamp with thy foot , and say , alas for all the evil abominations of the house of israel ! for they shall fall by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence .
and they shall know that i am the lord , and that i have not said in vain that i would do this evil unto them .
and jesus stood , and commanded him to be brought unto him : and when he was come near , he asked him ,
saying , what wilt thou that i shall do unto thee ? and he said , lord , that i may receive my sight .
what shall one then answer the messengers of the nation ? that the lord hath founded zion , and the poor of his people shall trust in it .
and through a window in a basket was i let down by the wall , and escaped his hands .
and jesus said unto him , receive thy sight : thy faith hath saved thee .
in damascus the governor under aretas the king kept the city of the damascenes with a garrison , desirous to apprehend me :
and immediately he received his sight , and followed him , glorifying god : and all the people , when they saw it , gave praise unto god .
and the firstborn of the poor shall feed , and the needy shall lie down in safety : and i will kill thy root with famine , and he shall slay thy remnant .
the god and father of our lord jesus christ , which is blessed for evermore , knoweth that i lie not .
again the word of the lord of hosts came to me , saying ,
thus saith the lord ; i am returned unto zion , and will dwell in the midst of jerusalem : and jerusalem shall be called a city of truth ; and the mountain of the lord of hosts the holy mountain .
thus saith the lord of hosts ; i was jealous for zion with great jealousy , and i was jealous for her with great fury .
and the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof .
thus saith the lord of hosts ; there shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of jerusalem , and every man with his staff in his hand for very age .
thus saith the lord of hosts ; behold , i will save my people from the east country , and from the west country ;
thus saith the lord of hosts ; if it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days , should it also be marvellous in mine eyes ? saith the lord of hosts .
thou shalt not be joined with them in burial , because thou hast destroyed thy land , and slain thy people : the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned .
i will also make it a possession for the bittern , and pools of water : and i will sweep it with the besom of destruction , saith the lord of hosts .
for i will rise up against them , saith the lord of hosts , and cut off from babylon the name , and remnant , and son , and nephew , saith the lord .
the lord of hosts hath sworn , saying , surely as i have thought , so shall it come to pass ; and as i have purposed , so shall it stand :
for the lord of hosts hath purposed , and who shall disannul it ? and his hand is stretched out , and who shall turn it back ?
this is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth : and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations .
rejoice not thou , whole palestina , because the rod of him that smote thee is broken : for out of the serpent ' s root shall come forth a cockatrice , and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent .
in the year that king ahaz died was this burden .
yet thou shalt be brought down to hell , to the sides of the pit .
they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee , and consider thee , saying , is this the man that made the earth to tremble , that did shake kingdoms ;
that made the world as a wilderness , and destroyed the cities thereof ; that opened not the house of his prisoners ?
all the kings of the nations , even all of them , lie in glory , every one in his own house .
thy pomp is brought down to the grave , and the noise of thy viols : the worm is spread under thee , and the worms cover thee .
the lord will not spare him , but then the anger of the lord and his jealousy shall smoke against that man , and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him , and the lord shall blot out his name from under heaven .
how art thou fallen from heaven , o lucifer , son of the morning ! how art thou cut down to the ground , which didst weaken the nations !
for thou hast said in thine heart , i will ascend into heaven , i will exalt my throne above the stars of god : i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation , in the sides of the north :
i will ascend above the heights of the clouds ; i will be like the most high .
all they shall speak and say unto thee , art thou also become weak as we ? art thou become like unto us ?
and it come to pass , when he heareth the words of this curse , that he bless himself in his heart , saying , i shall have peace , though i walk in the imagination of mine heart , to add drunkenness to thirst :
lest there should be among you man , or woman , or family , or tribe , whose heart turneth away this day from the lord our god , to go and serve the gods of these nations ; lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood ;
that he may establish thee to day for a people unto himself , and that he may be unto thee a god , as he hath said unto thee , and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers , to abraham , to isaac , and to jacob .
that thou shouldest enter into covenant with the lord thy god , and into his oath , which the lord thy god maketh with thee this day :
your little ones , your wives , and thy stranger that is in thy camp , from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water :
ye stand this day all of you before the lord your god ; your captains of your tribes , your elders , and your officers , with all the men of israel ,
and ye have seen their abominations , and their idols , wood and stone , silver and gold , which were among them : )
( for ye know how we have dwelt in the land of egypt ; and how we came through the nations which ye passed by ;
but thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch , and as the raiment of those that are slain , thrust through with a sword , that go down to the stones of the pit ; as a carcase trodden under feet .
but with him that standeth here with us this day before the lord our god , and also with him that is not here with us this day :
neither with you only do i make this covenant and this oath ;
but the king shall rejoice in god ; every one that sweareth by him shall glory : but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped .
they shall fall by the sword : they shall be a portion for foxes .
then all the captains of the forces , and johanan the son of kareah , and jezaniah the son of hoshaiah , and all the people from the least even unto the greatest , came near ,
and said unto jeremiah the prophet , let , we beseech thee , our supplication be accepted before thee , and pray for us unto the lord thy god , even for all this remnant ; ( for we are left but a few of many , as thine eyes do behold us : )
that the lord thy god may shew us the way wherein we may walk , and the thing that we may do .
then jeremiah the prophet said unto them , i have heard you ; behold , i will pray unto the lord your god according to your words ; and it shall come to pass , that whatsoever thing the lord shall answer you , i will declare it unto you ; i will keep nothing back from you .
then they said to jeremiah , the lord be a true and faithful witness between us , if we do not even according to all things for the which the lord thy god shall send thee to us .
whether it be good , or whether it be evil , we will obey the voice of the lord our god , to whom we send thee ; that it may be well with us , when we obey the voice of the lord our god .
and it came to pass after ten days , that the word of the lord came unto jeremiah .
then called he johanan the son of kareah , and all the captains of the forces which were with him , and all the people from the least even to the greatest ,
and said unto them , thus saith the lord , the god of israel , unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him ;
by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand , and rejoice in hope of the glory of god .
therefore being justified by faith , we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ :
the secret things belong unto the lord our god : but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever , that we may do all the words of this law .
for they went and served other gods , and worshipped them , gods whom they knew not , and whom he had not given unto them :
for when we were yet without strength , in due time christ died for the ungodly .
then men shall say , because they have forsaken the covenant of the lord god of their fathers , which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of egypt :
and not only so , but we glory in tribulations also : knowing that tribulation worketh patience ;
and the lord rooted them out of their land in anger , and in wrath , and in great indignation , and cast them into another land , as it is this day .
and patience , experience ; and experience , hope :
and the anger of the lord was kindled against this land , to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book :
much more then , being now justified by his blood , we shall be saved from wrath through him .
so that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you , and the stranger that shall come from a far land , shall say , when they see the plagues of that land , and the sicknesses which the lord hath laid upon it ;
and the lord shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of israel , according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this book of the law :
for scarcely for a righteous man will one die : yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die .
even all nations shall say , wherefore hath the lord done thus unto this land ? what meaneth the heat of this great anger ?
but god commendeth his love toward us , in that , while we were yet sinners , christ died for us .
i beseech thee for my son onesimus , whom i have begotten in my bonds :
which in time past was to thee unprofitable , but now profitable to thee and to me :
whom i have sent again : thou therefore receive him , that is , mine own bowels :
whom i would have retained with me , that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel :
but without thy mind would i do nothing ; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity , but willingly .
for perhaps he therefore departed for a season , that thou shouldest receive him for ever ;
not now as a servant , but above a servant , a brother beloved , specially to me , but how much more unto thee , both in the flesh , and in the lord ?
if thou count me therefore a partner , receive him as myself .
if he hath wronged thee , or oweth thee ought , put that on mine account ;
i paul have written it with mine own hand , i will repay it : albeit i do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides .
but withal prepare me also a lodging : for i trust that through your prayers i shall be given unto you .
there salute thee epaphras , my fellowprisoner in christ jesus ;
yea , brother , let me have joy of thee in the lord : refresh my bowels in the lord .
having confidence in thy obedience i wrote unto thee , knowing that thou wilt also do more than i say .
a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump .
marcus , aristarchus , demas , lucas , my fellowlabourers .
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit . amen .
christ is become of no effect unto you , whosoever of you are justified by the law ; ye are fallen from grace .
for i testify again to every man that is circumcised , that he is a debtor to do the whole law .
stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith christ hath made us free , and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage .
this persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you .
ye did run well ; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth ?
for in jesus christ neither circumcision availeth anything , nor uncircumcision ; but faith which worketh by love .
for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith .
so they took up jonah , and cast him forth into the sea : and the sea ceased from her raging .
then the men feared the lord exceedingly , and offered a sacrifice unto the lord , and made vows .
nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land ; but they could not : for the sea wrought , and was tempestuous against them .
wherefore they cried unto the lord , and said , we beseech thee , o lord , we beseech thee , let us not perish for this man ' s life , and lay not upon us innocent blood : for thou , o lord , hast done as it pleased thee .
now the lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up jonah . and jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights .
and he said unto them , take me up , and cast me forth into the sea ; so shall the sea be calm unto you : for i know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you .
then said they unto him , what shall we do unto thee , that the sea may be calm unto us ? for the sea wrought , and was tempestuous .
then were the men exceedingly afraid , and said unto him , why hast thou done this ? for the men knew that he fled from the presence of the lord , because he had told them .
but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father .
even so we , when we were children , were in bondage under the elements of the world :
but when the fulness of the time was come , god sent forth his son , made of a woman , made under the law ,
to redeem them that were under the law , that we might receive the adoption of sons .
and because ye are sons , god hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts , crying , abba , father .
wherefore thou art no more a servant , but a son ; and if a son , then an heir of god through christ .
howbeit then , when ye knew not god , ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods .
but now , after that ye have known god , or rather are known of god , how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements , whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage ?
now i say , that the heir , as long as he is a child , differeth nothing from a servant , though he be lord of all ;
and it came to pass about this time , that joseph went into the house to do his business ; and there was none of the men of the house there within .
and she caught him by his garment , saying , lie with me : and he left his garment in her hand , and fled , and got him out .
then adonijah the son of haggith exalted himself , saying , i will be king : and he prepared him chariots and horsemen , and fifty men to run before him .
and the damsel was very fair , and cherished the king , and ministered to him : but the king knew her not .
and he conferred with joab the son of zeruiah , and with abiathar the priest : and they following adonijah helped him .
and his father had not displeased him at any time in saying , why hast thou done so ? and he also was a very goodly man ; and his mother bare him after absalom .
so they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of israel , and found abishag a shunammite , and brought her to the king .
wherefore his servants said unto him , let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin : and let her stand before the king , and let her cherish him , and let her lie in thy bosom , that my lord the king may get heat .
and she laid up his garment by her , until his lord came home .
depart ye , depart ye , go ye out from thence , touch no unclean thing ; go ye out of the midst of her ; be ye clean , that bear the vessels of the lord .
and it came to pass , when he heard that i lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment with me , and fled , and got him out .
for ye shall not go out with haste , nor go by flight : for the lord will go before you ; and the god of israel will be your rereward .
that she called unto the men of her house , and spake unto them , saying , see , he hath brought in an hebrew unto us to mock us ; he came in unto me to lie with me , and i cried with a loud voice :
and it came to pass , when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand , and was fled forth ,
the lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations ; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our god .
and it came to pass , when his master heard the words of his wife , which she spake unto him , saying , after this manner did thy servant to me ; that his wrath was kindled .
and it came to pass , as i lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment with me , and fled out .
and she spake unto him according to these words , saying , the hebrew servant , which thou hast brought unto us , came in unto me to mock me :
for the king had at sea a navy of tharshish with the navy of hiram : once in three years came the navy of tharshish , bringing gold , and silver , ivory , and apes , and peacocks .
so king solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom .
and all the earth sought to solomon , to hear his wisdom , which god had put in his heart .
and they brought every man his present , vessels of silver , and vessels of gold , and garments , and armour , and spices , horses , and mules , a rate year by year .
and the keeper of the prison committed to joseph ' s hand all the prisoners that were in the prison ; and whatsoever they did there , he was the doer of it .
the keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand ; because the lord was with him , and that which he did , the lord made it to prosper .
so shall he sprinkle many nations ; the kings shall shut their mouths at him : for that which had not been told them shall they see ; and that which they had not heard shall they consider .
and twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps : there was not the like made in any kingdom .
and joseph ' s master took him , and put him into the prison , a place where the king ' s prisoners were bound : and he was there in the prison .
as many were astonied at thee ; his visage was so marred more than any man , and his form more than the sons of men :
and all king solomon ' s drinking vessels were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forest of lebanon were of pure gold ; none were of silver : it was nothing accounted of in the days of solomon .
but the lord was with joseph , and shewed him mercy , and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison .
behold , my servant shall deal prudently , he shall be exalted and extolled , and be very high .
and solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen : and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots , and twelve thousand horsemen , whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots , and with the king at jerusalem .
but zadok the priest , and benaiah the son of jehoiada , and nathan the prophet , and shimei , and rei , and the mighty men which belonged to david , were not with adonijah .
and the king made silver to be in jerusalem as stones , and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale , for abundance .
and adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of zoheleth , which is by en - rogel , and called all his brethren the king ' s sons , and all the men of judah the king ' s servants :
and solomon had horses brought out of egypt , and linen yarn : the king ' s merchants received the linen yarn at a price .
and a chariot came up and went out of egypt for six hundred shekels of silver , and an horse for an hundred and fifty : and so for all the kings of the hittites , and for the kings of syria , did they bring them out by their means .
that thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night , upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there ; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward this place .
if a man sin against his neighbour , and an oath be laid upon him to make him swear , and the oath come before thine altar in this house ;
hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant , and of thy people israel , which they shall make toward this place : hear thou from thy dwelling place , even from heaven ; and when thou hearest , forgive .
and if thy people israel be put to the worse before the enemy , because they have sinned against thee ; and shall return and confess thy name , and pray and make supplication before thee in this house ;
then hear thou from heaven , and do , and judge thy servants , by requiting the wicked , by recompensing his way upon his own head ; and by justifying the righteous , by giving him according to his righteousness .
when the heaven is shut up , and there is no rain , because they have sinned against thee ; yet if they pray toward this place , and confess thy name , and turn from their sin , when thou dost afflict them ;
then hear thou from the heavens , and forgive the sin of thy people israel , and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers .
now then , o lord god of israel , let thy word be verified , which thou hast spoken unto thy servant david .
but will god in very deed dwell with men on the earth ? behold , heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee ; how much less this house which i have built !
have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant , and to his supplication , o lord my god , to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee :
this witness is true . wherefore rebuke them sharply , that they may be sound in the faith ;
and in it have i put the ark , wherein is the covenant of the lord , that he made with the children of israel .
not giving heed to jewish fables , and commandments of men , that turn from the truth .
the lord therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken : for i am risen up in the room of david my father , and am set on the throne of israel , as the lord promised , and have built the house for the name of the lord god of israel .
whose mouths must be stopped , who subvert whole houses , teaching things which they ought not , for filthy lucre ' s sake .
one of themselves , even a prophet of their own , said , the cretians are alway liars , evil beasts , slow bellies .
thou which hast kept with thy servant david my father that which thou hast promised him ; and spakest with thy mouth , and hast fulfilled it with thine hand , as it is this day .
and said , o lord god of israel , there is no god like thee in the heaven , nor in the earth ; which keepest covenant , and shewest mercy unto thy servants , that walk before thee with all their hearts :
they profess that they know god ; but in works they deny him , being abominable , and disobedient , and unto every good work reprobate .
and he stood before the altar of the lord in the presence of all the congregation of israel , and spread forth his hands :
for there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers , specially they of the circumcision :
and he saith unto the man which had the withered hand , stand forth .
and he saith unto them , is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days , or to do evil ? to save life , or to kill ? but they held their peace .
and when he had looked round about on them with anger , being grieved for the hardness of their hearts , he saith unto the man , stretch forth thine hand . and he stretched it out : and his hand was restored whole as the other .
and the pharisees went forth , and straightway took counsel with the herodians against him , how they might destroy him .
and he entered again into the synagogue ; and there was a man there which had a withered hand .
and they watched him , whether he would heal him on the sabbath day ; that they might accuse him .
now , my god , let , i beseech thee , thine eyes be open , and let thine ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this place .
and mizraim begat ludim , and anamim , and lehabim , and naphtuhim ,
bless ye the lord , all ye his hosts ; ye ministers of his , that do his pleasure .
and resen between nineveh and calah : the same is a great city .
bless the lord , ye his angels , that excel in strength , that do his commandments , hearkening unto the voice of his word .
out of that land went forth asshur , and builded nineveh , and the city rehoboth , and calah ,
and the beginning of his kingdom was babel , and erech , and accad , and calneh , in the land of shinar .
bless the lord , all his works in all places of his dominion : bless the lord , o my soul .
and the jebusite , and the amorite , and the girgasite ,
and canaan begat sidon his firstborn , and heth ,
and pathrusim , and casluhim , ( out of whom came philistim , ) and caphtorim .
now therefore arise , o lord god , into thy resting place , thou , and the ark of thy strength : let thy priests , o lord god , be clothed with salvation , and let thy saints rejoice in goodness .
o lord god , turn not away the face of thine anointed : remember the mercies of david thy servant .
and the border of the canaanites was from sidon , as thou comest to gerar , unto gaza ; as thou goest , unto sodom , and gomorrah , and admah , and zeboim , even unto lasha .
then hear thou from the heavens , even from thy dwelling place , their prayer and their supplications , and maintain their cause , and forgive thy people which have sinned against thee .
these are the sons of ham , after their families , after their tongues , in their countries , and in their nations .
the children of shem ; elam , and asshur , and arphaxad , and lud , and aram .
unto shem also , the father of all the children of eber , the brother of japheth the elder , even to him were children born .
and arphaxad begat salah ; and salah begat eber .
and the children of aram ; uz , and hul , and gether , and mash .
if they sin against thee , ( for there is no man which sinneth not , ) and thou be angry with them , and deliver them over before their enemies , and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or near ;
and joktan begat almodad , and sheleph , and hazar - maveth , and jerah ,
yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive , and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their captivity , saying , we have sinned , we have done amiss , and have dealt wickedly ;
and unto eber were born two sons : the name of one was peleg ; for in his days was the earth divided ; and his brother ' s name was joktan .
if thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that thou shalt send them , and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen , and the house which i have built for thy name ;
and obal , and abimael , and sheba ,
then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication , and maintain their cause .
and hadoram , and uzal , and diklah ,
moreover concerning the stranger , which is not of thy people israel , but is come from a far country for thy great name ' s sake , and thy mighty hand , and thy stretched out arm ; if they come and pray in this house ;
and ophir , and havilah , and jobab : all these were the sons of joktan .
then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place , and forgive , and render unto every man according unto all his ways , whose heart thou knowest ; ( for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men : )
then what prayer or what supplication soever shall be made of any man , or of all thy people israel , when every one shall know his own sore and his own grief , and shall spread forth his hands in this house :
if there be dearth in the land , if there be pestilence , if there be blasting , or mildew , locusts , or caterpillers ; if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land ; whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness there be :
then hear thou from heaven , and forgive the sin of thy servants , and of thy people israel , when thou hast taught them the good way , wherein they should walk ; and send rain upon thy land , which thou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance .
then said zedekiah unto jeremiah , let no man know of these words , and thou shalt not die .
but if the princes hear that i have talked with thee , and they come unto thee , and say unto thee , declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king , hide it not from us , and we will not put thee to death ; also what the king said unto thee :
then thou shalt say unto them , i presented my supplication before the king , that he would not cause me to return to jonathan ' s house , to die there .
these are the families of the sons of noah , after their generations , in their nations : and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood .
then came all the princes unto jeremiah , and asked him : and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded . so they left off speaking with him ; for the matter was not perceived .
these are the sons of shem , after their families , after their tongues , in their lands , after their nations .
so jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that jerusalem was taken : and he was there when jerusalem was taken .
and their dwelling was from mesha , as thou goest unto sephar a mount of the east .
but jeremiah said , they shall not deliver thee . obey , i beseech thee , the voice of the lord , which i speak unto thee : so it shall be well unto thee , and thy soul shall live .
but if thou refuse to go forth , this is the word that the lord hath shewed me :
so they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the chaldeans : and thou shalt not escape out of their hand , but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of babylon : and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire .
and he made three hundred shields of beaten gold ; three pound of gold went to one shield : and the king put them in the house of the forest of lebanon .
and king solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold : six hundred shekels of gold went to one target .
beside that he had of the merchantmen , and of the traffick of the spice merchants , and of all the kings of arabia , and of the governors of the country .
the throne had six steps , and the top of the throne was round behind : and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat , and two lions stood beside the stays .
and she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold , and of spices very great store , and precious stones : there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of sheba gave to king solomon .
now the weight of gold that came to solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold .
and king solomon gave unto the queen of sheba all her desire , whatsoever she asked , beside that which solomon gave her of his royal bounty . so she turned and went to her own country , she and her servants .
and the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the lord , and for the king ' s house , harps also and psalteries for singers : there came no such almug trees , nor were seen unto this day .
and the navy also of hiram , that brought gold from ophir , brought in from ophir great plenty of almug trees , and precious stones .
as far as the east is from the west , so far hath he removed our transgressions from us .
then jeremiah said unto zedekiah , if i declare it unto thee , wilt thou not surely put me to death ? and if i give thee counsel , wilt thou not hearken unto me ?
for as the heaven is high above the earth , so great is his mercy toward them that fear him .
so zedekiah the king sware secretly unto jeremiah , saying , as the lord liveth , that made us this soul , i will not put thee to death , neither will i give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life .
he hath not dealt with us after our sins ; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities .
so they drew up jeremiah with cords , and took him up out of the dungeon : and jeremiah remained in the court of the prison .
then zedekiah the king sent , and took jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the lord : and the king said unto jeremiah , i will ask thee a thing ; hide nothing from me .
and zedekiah the king said unto jeremiah , i am afraid of the jews that are fallen to the chaldeans , lest they deliver me into their hand , and they mock me .
but if thou wilt not go forth to the king of babylon ' s princes , then shall this city be given into the hand of the chaldeans , and they shall burn it with fire , and thou shalt not escape out of their hand .
the lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens ; and his kingdom ruleth over all .
to such as keep his covenant , and to those that remember his commandments to do them .
but the mercy of the lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him , and his righteousness unto children ' s children ;
for the wind passeth over it , and it is gone ; and the place thereof shall know it no more .
as for man , his days are as grass : as a flower of the field , so he flourisheth .
and ebed - melech the ethiopian said unto jeremiah , put now these old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords . and jeremiah did so .
for he knoweth our frame ; he remembereth that we are dust .
like as a father pitieth his children , so the lord pitieth them that fear him .
then the king commanded ebed - melech the ethiopian , saying , take from hence thirty men with thee , and take up jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon , before he die .
the pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself , god , i thank thee , that i am not as other men are , extortioners , unjust , adulterers , or even as this publican .
and hast brought forth thy people israel out of the land of egypt with signs , and with wonders , and with a strong hand , and with a stretched out arm , and with great terror ;
two men went up into the temple to pray ; the one a pharisee , and the other a publican .
which hast set signs and wonders in the land of egypt , even unto this day , and in israel , and among other men ; and hast made thee a name , as at this day ;
and they came in , and possessed it ; but they obeyed not thy voice , neither walked in thy law ; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do : therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them :
and hast given them this land , which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them , a land flowing with milk and honey ;
and thou hast said unto me , o lord god , buy thee the field for money , and take witnesses ; for the city is given into the hand of the chaldeans .
from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old , every one that came to do the service of the ministry , and the service of the burden in the tabernacle of the congregation ,
all those that were numbered of the levites , whom moses and aaron and the chief of israel numbered , after their families , and after the house of their fathers ,
according to the commandment of the lord they were numbered by the hand of moses , every one according to his service , and according to his burden : thus were they numbered of him , as the lord commanded moses .
even those that were numbered of them , were eight thousand and five hundred and fourscore .
even those that were numbered of them , throughout their families , by the house of their fathers , were two thousand and six hundred and thirty .
these are they that were numbered of the families of the sons of gershon , of all that might do service in the tabernacle of the congregation , whom moses and aaron did number according to the commandment of the lord .
and those that were numbered of the families of the sons of merari , throughout their families , by the house of their fathers ,
from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old , every one that entereth into the service , for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation ,
thus speaketh the lord of hosts , saying , execute true judgment , and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother :
even those that were numbered of them after their families , were three thousand and two hundred .
these be those that were numbered of the families of the sons of merari , whom moses and aaron numbered according to the word of the lord by the hand of moses .
but jesus called them unto him , and said , suffer little children to come unto me , and forbid them not : for of such is the kingdom of god .
then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah , saying ,
verily i say unto you , whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child shall in no wise enter therein .
behold , i am the lord , the god of all flesh : is there any thing too hard for me ?
and a certain ruler asked him , saying , good master , what shall i do to inherit eternal life ?
therefore thus saith the lord ; behold , i will give this city into the hand of the chaldeans , and into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon , and he shall take it :
and jesus said unto him , why callest thou me good ? none is good , save one , that is , god .
i fast twice in the week , i give tithes of all that i possess .
and the publican , standing afar off , would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven , but smote upon his breast , saying , god be merciful to me a sinner .
i tell you , this man went down to his house justified rather than the other : for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased ; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted .
and they brought unto him also infants , that he would touch them : but when his disciples saw it , they rebuked them .
and zedekiah the son of chenaanah had made him horns of iron , and said , thus saith the lord , with these thou shalt push syria until they be consumed .
and i subscribed the evidence , and sealed it , and took witnesses , and weighed him the money in the balances .
and when he was come to the king , the king said unto him , micaiah , shall we go to ramoth - gilead to battle , or shall i forbear ? and he said , go ye up , and prosper , and they shall be delivered into your hand .
thus saith the lord of hosts , the god of israel ; take these evidences , this evidence of the purchase , both which is sealed , and this evidence which is open ; and put them in an earthen vessel , that they may continue many days .
and micaiah said , as the lord liveth , even what my god saith , that will i speak .
and i charged baruch before them , saying ,
and the messenger that went to call micaiah spake to him , saying , behold , the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one assent ; let thy word therefore , i pray thee , be like one of theirs , and speak thou good .
and i gave the evidence of the purchase unto baruch the son of neriah , the son of maaseiah , in the sight of hanameel mine uncle ' s son , and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase , before all the jews that sat in the court of the prison .
and all the prophets prophesied so , saying , go up to ramoth - gilead , and prosper : for the lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king .
so i took the evidence of the purchase , both that which was sealed according to the law and custom , and that which was open :
again he said , therefore hear the word of the lord ; i saw the lord sitting upon his throne , and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left .
and the king of israel said to jehoshaphat , did i not tell thee that he would not prophesy good unto me , but evil ?
then he said , i did see all israel scattered upon the mountains , as sheep that have no shepherd : and the lord said , these have no master ; let them return therefore every man to his house in peace .
and the king said to him , how many times shall i adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the lord ?
and the lord said , who shall entice ahab king of israel , that he may go up and fall at ramoth - gilead ? and one spake saying after this manner , and another saying after that manner .
ah lord god ! behold , thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm , and there is nothing too hard for thee :
thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands , and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them : the great , the mighty god , the lord of hosts , is his name ,
for thus saith the lord of hosts , the god of israel ; houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land .
now when i had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto baruch the son of neriah , i prayed unto the lord , saying ,
great in counsel , and mighty in work : for thine eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men : to give every one according to his ways , and according to the fruit of his doings :
then zedekiah the son of chenaanah came near , and smote micaiah upon the cheek , and said , which way went the spirit of the lord from me to speak unto thee ?
now therefore , behold , the lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets , and the lord hath spoken evil against thee .
then he took unto him the twelve , and said unto them , behold , we go up to jerusalem , and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the son of man shall be accomplished .
who shall not receive manifold more in this present time , and in the world to come life everlasting .
and they shall scourge him , and put him to death : and the third day he shall rise again .
and he said , i will go out , and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets . and the lord said , thou shalt entice him , and thou shalt also prevail : go out , and do even so .
for he shall be delivered unto the gentiles , and shall be mocked , and spitefully entreated , and spitted on :
then there came out a spirit , and stood before the lord , and said , i will entice him . and the lord said unto him , wherewith ?
and jehoshaphat the king of judah returned to his house in peace to jerusalem .
and jehu the son of hanani the seer went out to meet him , and said to king jehoshaphat , shouldest thou help the ungodly , and love them that hate the lord ? therefore is wrath upon thee from before the lord .
and micaiah said , if thou certainly return in peace , then hath not the lord spoken by me . and he said , hearken , all ye people .
and say , thus saith the king , put this fellow in the prison , and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction , until i return in peace .
and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat , i will disguise myself , and will go to the battle ; but put thou on thy robes . so the king of israel disguised himself ; and they went to the battle .
so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah went up to ramoth - gilead .
and he charged them , saying , thus shall ye do in the fear of the lord , faithfully , and with a perfect heart .
moreover in jerusalem did jehoshaphat set of the levites , and of the priests , and of the chief of the fathers of israel , for the judgment of the lord , and for controversies , when they returned to jerusalem .
wherefore now let the fear of the lord be upon you ; take heed and do it : for there is no iniquity with the lord our god , nor respect of persons , nor taking of gifts .
and said to the judges , take heed what ye do : for ye judge not for man , but for the lord , who is with you in the judgment .
for he said , surely they are my people , children that will not lie : so he was their saviour .
and he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of judah , city by city ,
in all their affliction he was afflicted , and the angel of his presence saved them : in his love and in his pity he redeemed them ; and he bare them , and carried them all the days of old .
and jehoshaphat dwelt at jerusalem : and he went out again through the people from beer - sheba to mount ephraim , and brought them back unto the lord god of their fathers .
and i will tread down the people in mine anger , and make them drunk in my fury , and i will bring down their strength to the earth .
nevertheless there are good things found in thee , in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land , and hast prepared thine heart to seek god .
i will mention the lovingkindnesses of the lord , and the praises of the lord , according to all that the lord hath bestowed on us , and the great goodness toward the house of israel , which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies , and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses .
and they understood none of these things : and this saying was hid from them , neither knew they the things which were spoken .
for the day of vengeance is in mine heart , and the year of my redeemed is come .
and it came to pass , that as he was come nigh unto jericho , a certain blind man sat by the way side begging :
and i looked , and there was none to help ; and i wondered that there was none to uphold : therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me ; and my fury , it upheld me .
and hearing the multitude pass by , he asked what it meant .
wherefore art thou red in thine apparel , and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat ?
and they told him , that jesus of nazareth passeth by .
i have trodden the winepress alone ; and of the people there was none with me : for i will tread them in mine anger , and trample them in my fury ; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments , and i will stain all my raiment .
and he cried , saying , jesus , thou son of david , have mercy on me .
and they which went before rebuked him , that he should hold his peace : but he cried so much the more , thou son of david , have mercy on me .
who is this that cometh from edom , with dyed garments from bozrah ? this that is glorious in his apparel , travelling in the greatness of his strength ? i that speak in righteousness , mighty to save .
wherefore i praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive .
so i returned , and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun : and behold the tears of such as were oppressed , and they had no comforter ; and on the side of their oppressors there was power ; but they had no comforter .
and it came to pass in the days of ahaz the son of jotham , the son of uzziah , king of judah , that rezin the king of syria , and pekah the son of remaliah , king of israel , went up toward jerusalem to war against it , but could not prevail against it .
and the battle increased that day : howbeit the king of israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the syrians until the even : and about the time of the sun going down he died .
and a certain man drew a bow at a venture , and smote the king of israel between the joints of the harness : therefore he said to his chariot man , turn thine hand , that thou mayest carry me out of the host ; for i am wounded .
now when jesus heard these things , he said unto him , yet lackest thou one thing : sell all that thou hast , and distribute unto the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come , follow me .
for it came to pass , that , when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of israel , they turned back again from pursuing him .
better is an handful with quietness , than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit .
and he said , all these have i kept from my youth up .
and it came to pass , when the captains of the chariots saw jehoshaphat , that they said , it is the king of israel . therefore they compassed about him to fight : but jehoshaphat cried out , and the lord helped him ; and god moved them to depart from him .
the fool foldeth his hands together , and eateth his own flesh .
thou knowest the commandments , do not commit adultery , do not kill , do not steal , do not bear false witness , honour thy father and thy mother .
now the king of syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him , saying , fight ye not with small or great , save only with the king of israel .
again , i considered all travail , and every right work , that for this a man is envied of his neighbour . this is also vanity and vexation of spirit .
yea , better is he than both they , which hath not yet been , who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun .
for the head of syria is damascus , and the head of damascus is rezin ; and within threescore and five years shall ephraim be broken , that it be not a people .
and to speak unto the priests which were in the house of the lord of hosts , and to the prophets , saying , should i weep in the fifth month , separating myself , as i have done these so many years ?
two are better than one ; because they have a good reward for their labour .
and the head of ephraim is samaria , and the head of samaria is remaliah ' s son . if ye will not believe , surely ye shall not be established .
then came the word of the lord of hosts unto me , saying ,
let us go up against judah , and vex it , and let us make a breach therein for us , and set a king in the midst of it , even the son of tabeal :
and it came to pass in the fourth year of king darius , that the word of the lord came unto zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month , even in chisleu ;
then i returned , and i saw vanity under the sun .
thus saith the lord god , it shall not stand , neither shall it come to pass .
and say unto him , take heed , and be quiet ; fear not , neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands , for the fierce anger of rezin with syria , and of the son of remaliah .
should ye not hear the words which the lord hath cried by the former prophets , when jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity , and the cities thereof round about her , when men inhabited the south and the plain ?
because syria , ephraim , and the son of remaliah , have taken evil counsel against thee , saying ,
and the word of the lord came unto zechariah , saying ,
speak unto all the people of the land , and to the priests , saying , when ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month , even those seventy years , did ye at all fast unto me , even to me ?
then said the lord unto isaiah , go forth now to meet ahaz , thou , and shear - jashub thy son , at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller ' s field ;
and when ye did eat , and when ye did drink , did not ye eat for yourselves , and drink for yourselves ?
for it is easier for a camel to go through a needle ' s eye , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god .
and they that heard it said , who then can be saved ?
and when he heard this , he was very sorrowful : for he was very rich .
and when jesus saw that he was very sorrowful , he said , how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god !
and he said unto them , verily i say unto you , there is no man that hath left house , or parents , or brethren , or wife , or children , for the kingdom of god ' s sake ,
and he said , the things which are impossible with men are possible with god .
then peter said , lo , we have left all , and followed thee .
the thirteenth to huppah , the fourteenth to jeshebeab ,
the fifteenth to bilgah , the sixteenth to immer ,
the ninth to jeshua , the tenth to shecaniah ,
the eleventh to eliashib , the twelfth to jakim ,
the one and twentieth to jachin , the two and twentieth to gamul ,
the three and twentieth to delaiah , the four and twentieth to maaziah .
the seventeenth to hezir , the eighteenth to aphses ,
the nineteenth to pethahiah , the twentieth to jehezekel ,
and now , behold , i know well that thou shalt surely be king , and that the kingdom of israel shall be established in thine hand .
and he hath brought us into this place , and hath given us this land , even a land that floweth with milk and honey .
and the lord brought us forth out of egypt with a mighty hand , and with an outstretched arm , and with great terribleness , and with signs , and with wonders :
and thou shalt speak and say before the lord thy god , a syrian ready to perish was my father , and he went down into egypt , and sojourned there with a few , and became there a nation , great , mighty , and populous :
the seventh to hakkoz , the eighth to abijah ,
and the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand , and set it down before the altar of the lord thy god .
and when we cried unto the lord god of our fathers , the lord heard our voice , and looked on our affliction , and our labour , and our oppression :
and the egyptians evil entreated us , and afflicted us , and laid upon us hard bondage :
but jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea : and a great multitude from galilee followed him , and from judaea ,
and it shall be , when thou art come in unto the land which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance , and possessest it , and dwellest therein ;
and from jerusalem , and from idumaea , and from beyond jordan ; and they about tyre and sidon , a great multitude , when they had heard what great things he did , came unto him .
that thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the earth , which thou shalt bring of thy land that the lord thy god giveth thee , and shalt put it in a basket , and shalt go unto the place which the lord thy god shall choose to place his name there .
and he spake to his disciples , that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude , lest they should throng him .
and thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days , and say unto him , i profess this day unto the lord thy god , that i am come unto the country which the lord sware unto our fathers for to give us .
and david sware unto saul . and saul went home ; but david and his men gat them up unto the hold .
swear now therefore unto me by the lord , that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me , and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father ' s house .
these were the orderings of them in their service to come into the house of the lord , according to their manner , under aaron their father , as the lord god of israel had commanded him .
for if a man find his enemy , will he let him go well away ? wherefore the lord reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day .
and thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me : forasmuch as when the lord had delivered me into thine hand , thou killedst me not .
as saith the proverb of the ancients , wickedness proceedeth from the wicked : but mine hand shall not be upon thee .
the lord judge between me and thee , and the lord avenge me of thee : but mine hand shall not be upon thee .
and he said to david , thou art more righteous than i : for thou hast rewarded me good , whereas i have rewarded thee evil .
and it came to pass , when david had made an end of speaking these words unto saul , that saul said , is this thy voice , my son david ? and saul lifted up his voice , and wept .
the lord therefore be judge , and judge between me and thee , and see , and plead my cause , and deliver me out of thine hand .
after whom is the king of israel come out ? after whom dost thou pursue ? after a dead dog , after a flea .
these likewise cast lots over against their brethren the sons of aaron in the presence of david the king , and zadok , and ahimelech , and the chief of the fathers of the priests and levites , even the principal fathers over against their younger brethren .
and i have filled him with the spirit of god , in wisdom , and in understanding , and in knowledge , and in all manner of workmanship ,
see , i have called by name bezaleel the son of uri , the son of hur , of the tribe of judah :
and in cutting of stones , to set them , and in carving of timber , to work in all manner of workmanship .
the sons also of mushi ; mahli , and eder , and jerimoth . these were the sons of the levites after the house of their fathers .
to devise cunning works , to work in gold , and in silver , and in brass ,
the tabernacle of the congregation , and the ark of the testimony , and the mercy seat that is thereupon , and all the furniture of the tabernacle ,
and i will make an everlasting covenant with them , that i will not turn away from them , to do them good ; but i will put my fear in their hearts , that they shall not depart from me .
and i , behold , i have given with him aholiab , the son of ahisamach , of the tribe of dan : and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted i have put wisdom , that they may make all that i have commanded thee ;
yea , i will rejoice over them to do them good , and i will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul .
and the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture , and the laver and his foot ,
for thus saith the lord ; like as i have brought all this great evil upon this people , so will i bring upon them all the good that i have promised them .
and the table and his furniture , and the pure candlestick with all his furniture , and the altar of incense ,
and fields shall be bought in this land , whereof ye say , it is desolate without man or beast ; it is given into the hand of the chaldeans .
for i will have respect unto you , and make you fruitful , and multiply you , and establish my covenant with you .
and five of you shall chase an hundred , and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight : and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword .
and ye shall chase your enemies , and they shall fall before you by the sword .
and i will give peace in the land , and ye shall lie down , and none shall make you afraid : and i will rid evil beasts out of the land , neither shall the sword go through your land .
and your threshing shall reach unto the vintage , and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time : and ye shall eat your bread to the full , and dwell in your land safely .
then i will give you rain in due season , and the land shall yield her increase , and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit .
if ye walk in my statutes , and keep my commandments , and do them ;
ye shall keep my sabbaths , and reverence my sanctuary : i am the lord .
ye shall make you no idols nor graven image , neither rear you up a standing image , neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land , to bow down unto it : for i am the lord your god .
and it came to pass after this , that absalom the son of david had a fair sister , whose name was tamar ; and amnon the son of david loved her .
the sons of merari were mahli and mushi : the sons of jaaziah ; beno .
the sons of merari by jaaziah ; beno , and shoham , and zaccur , and ibri .
and he said unto him , why art thou , being the king ' s son , lean from day to day ? wilt thou not tell me ? and amnon said unto him , i love tamar , my brother absalom ' s sister .
of mahli came eleazar , who had no sons .
but amnon had a friend , whose name was jonadab , the son of shimeah david ' s brother : and jonadab was a very subtil man .
concerning kish : the son of kish was jerahmeel .
and amnon was so vexed , that he fell sick for his sister tamar ; for she was a virgin ; and amnon thought it hard for him to do any thing to her .
of the izharites ; shelomoth : of the sons of shelomoth ; jahath .
and she took a pan , and poured them out before him ; but he refused to eat . and amnon said , have out all men from me . and they went out every man from him .
and the sons of hebron ; jeriah the first , amariah the second , jahaziel the third , jekameam the fourth .
so tamar went to her brother amnon ' s house ; and he was laid down . and she took flour , and kneaded it , and made cakes in his sight , and did bake the cakes .
of the sons of uzziel ; michah : of the sons of michah ; shamir .
then david sent home to tamar , saying , go now to thy brother amnon ' s house , and dress him meat .
the brother of michah was isshiah : of the sons of isshiah ; zechariah .
so amnon lay down , and made himself sick : and when the king was come to see him , amnon said unto the king , i pray thee , let tamar my sister come , and make me a couple of cakes in my sight , that i may eat at her hand .
and now therefore thus saith the lord , the god of israel , concerning this city , whereof ye say , it shall be delivered into the hand of the king of babylon by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pestilence ;
and the rest of the sons of levi were these : of the sons of amram ; shubael : of the sons of shubael ; jehdeiah .
and they have turned unto me the back , and not the face : though i taught them , rising up early and teaching them , yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction .
concerning rehabiah : of the sons of rehabiah , the first was isshiah .
but they set their abominations in the house , which is called by my name , to defile it .
for this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day ; that i should remove it from before my face ,
because of all the evil of the children of israel and of the children of judah , which they have done to provoke me to anger , they , their kings , their princes , their priests , and their prophets , and the men of judah , and the inhabitants of jerusalem .
for the children of israel and the children of judah have only done evil before me from their youth : for the children of israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands , saith the lord .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
and i will give them one heart , and one way , that they may fear me for ever , for the good of them , and of their children after them :
and they shall be my people , and i will be their god :
behold , i will gather them out of all countries , whither i have driven them in mine anger , and in my fury , and in great wrath ; and i will bring them again unto this place , and i will cause them to dwell safely :
and jesus , which is called justus , who are of the circumcision . these only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of god , which have been a comfort unto me .
for i bear him record , that he hath a great zeal for you , and them that are in laodicea , and them in hierapolis .
luke , the beloved physician , and demas , greet you .
aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you , and marcus , sister ' s son to barnabas , ( touching whom ye received commandments : if he come unto you , receive him ; )
salute the brethren which are in laodicea , and nymphas , and the church which is in his house .
and when this epistle is read among you , cause that it be read also in the church of the laodiceans ; and that ye likewise read the epistle from laodicea .
and say to archippus , take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the lord , that thou fulfil it .
behold , the lord hath a mighty and strong one , which as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm , as a flood of mighty waters overflowing , shall cast down to the earth with the hand .
woe to the crown of pride , to the drunkards of ephraim , whose glorious beauty is a fading flower , which are on the head of the fat valleys of them that are overcome with wine !
and the glorious beauty , which is on the head of the fat valley , shall be a fading flower , and as the hasty fruit before the summer ; which when he that looketh upon it seeth , while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up .
the crown of pride , the drunkards of ephraim , shall be trodden under feet :
in that day shall the lord of hosts be for a crown of glory , and for a diadem of beauty , unto the residue of his people ,
and for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment , and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate .
but they also have erred through wine , and through strong drink are out of the way ; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink , they are swallowed up of wine , they are out of the way through strong drink ; they err in vision , they stumble in judgment .
for all tables are full of vomit and filthiness , so that there is no place clean .
whom shall he teach knowledge ? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine ? them that are weaned from the milk , and drawn from the breasts .
a man shall not take his father ' s wife , nor discover his father ' s skirt .
so the edomites revolted from under the hand of judah unto this day . the same time also did libnah revolt from under his hand ; because he had forsaken the lord god of his fathers .
moreover he made high places in the mountains of judah , and caused the inhabitants of jerusalem to commit fornication , and compelled judah thereto .
and there came a writing to him from elijah the prophet , saying , thus saith the lord god of david thy father , because thou hast not walked in the ways of jehoshaphat thy father , nor in the ways of asa king of judah ,
but hast walked in the way of the kings of israel , and hast made judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem to go a whoring , like to the whoredoms of the house of ahab , and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father ' s house , which were better than thyself :
behold , with a great plague will the lord smite thy people , and thy children , and thy wives , and all thy goods :
moreover the lord stirred up against jehoram the spirit of the philistines , and of the arabians , that were near the ethiopians :
and thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels , until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day .
and after all this the lord smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease .
and they came up into judah , and brake into it , and carried away all the substance that was found in the king ' s house , and his sons also , and his wives ; so that there was never a son left him , save jehoahaz , the youngest of his sons .
and it came to pass , that in process of time , after the end of two years , his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness : so he died of sore diseases . and his people made no burning for him , like the burning of his fathers .
as well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there : all my springs are in thee .
glorious things are spoken of thee , o city of god . selah .
i will make mention of rahab and babylon to them that know me : behold philistia , and tyre , with ethiopia ; this man was born there .
and of zion it shall be said , this and that man was born in her : and the highest himself shall establish her .
the lord shall count , when he writeth up the people , that this man was born there . selah .
the lord loveth the gates of zion more than all the dwellings of jacob .
his foundation is in the holy mountains .
thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign , and he reigned in jerusalem eight years , and departed without being desired . howbeit they buried him in the city of david , but not in the sepulchres of the kings .
at the same time came the disciples unto jesus , saying , who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven ?
and jesus called a little child unto him , and set him in the midst of them ,
and said , verily i say unto you , except ye be converted , and become as little children , ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven .
whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child , the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven .
and whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me .
but whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me , it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea .
woe unto the world because of offences ! for it must needs be that offences come ; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh !
wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee , cut them off , and cast them from thee : it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed , rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire .
and if thine eye offend thee , pluck it out , and cast it from thee : it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire .
thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together .
if any man take a wife , and go in unto her , and hate her ,
and give occasions of speech against her , and bring up an evil name upon her , and say , i took this woman , and when i came to her , i found her not a maid :
thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts , as of woollen and linen together .
thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thy vesture , wherewith thou coverest thyself .
and , lo , he hath given occasions of speech against her , saying , i found not thy daughter a maid ; and yet these are the tokens of my daughter ' s virginity . and they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city .
and the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him ;
then shall the father of the damsel , and her mother , take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel ' s virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate :
and the damsel ' s father shall say unto the elders , i gave my daughter unto this man to wife , and he hateth her ;
and they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver , and give them unto the father of the damsel , because he hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of israel : and she shall be his wife ; he may not put her away all his days .
so paul departed from among them .
howbeit certain men clave unto him , and believed : among the which was dionysius the areopagite , and a woman named damaris , and others with them .
and the times of this ignorance god winked at ; but now commandeth all men every where to repent :
and when they heard of the resurrection of the dead , some mocked : and others said , we will hear thee again of this matter .
but if this thing be true , and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel :
because he hath appointed a day , in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained ; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men , in that he hath raised him from the dead .
if a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband , then they shall both of them die , both the man that lay with the woman , and the woman : so shalt thou put away evil from israel .
if a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband , and a man find her in the city , and lie with her ;
but if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field , and the man force her , and lie with her : then the man only that lay with her shall die :
but unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing ; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death : for as when a man riseth against his neighbour , and slayeth him , even so is this matter :
for he found her in the field , and the betrothed damsel cried , and there was none to save her .
if a man find a damsel that is a virgin , which is not betrothed , and lay hold on her , and lie with her , and they be found ;
then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel ' s father fifty shekels of silver , and she shall be his wife ; because he hath humbled her , he may not put her away all his days .
then paul stood in the midst of mars ' hill , and said , ye men of athens , i perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious .
for as i passed by , and beheld your devotions , i found an altar with this inscription , to the unknown god . whom therefore ye ignorantly worship , him declare i unto you .
god that made the world and all things therein , seeing that he is lord of heaven and earth , dwelleth not in temples made with hands ;
neither is worshipped with men ' s hands , as though he needed any thing , seeing he giveth to all life , and breath , and all things ;
and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth , and hath determined the times before appointed , and the bounds of their habitation ;
that they should seek the lord , if haply they might feel after him , and find him , though he be not far from every one of us :
for in him we live , and move , and have our being ; as certain also of your own poets have said , for we are also his offspring .
forasmuch then as we are the offspring of god , we ought not to think that the godhead is like unto gold , or silver , or stone , graven by art and man ' s device .
and i will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them : and they shall fear no more , nor be dismayed , neither shall they be lacking , saith the lord .
the posts of the temple were squared , and the face of the sanctuary ; the appearance of the one as the appearance of the other .
but the other answering rebuked him , saying , dost not thou fear god , seeing thou art in the same condemnation ?
behold , the days come , saith the lord , that i will raise unto david a righteous branch , and a king shall reign and prosper , and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth .
the altar of wood was three cubits high , and the length thereof two cubits ; and the corners thereof , and the length thereof , and the walls thereof , were of wood : and he said unto me , this is the table that is before the lord .
and we indeed justly ; for we receive the due reward of our deeds : but this man hath done nothing amiss .
therefore thus saith the lord god of israel against the pastors that feed my people ; ye have scattered my flock , and driven them away , and have not visited them : behold , i will visit upon you the evil of your doings , saith the lord .
and he said unto jesus , lord , remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom .
and i will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whither i have driven them , and will bring them again to their folds ; and they shall be fruitful and increase .
from the ground unto above the door were cherubims and palm trees made , and on the wall of the temple .
and jesus said unto him , verily i say unto thee , to day shalt thou be with me in paradise .
but , the lord liveth , which brought up and which led the seed of the house of israel out of the north country , and from all countries whither i had driven them ; and they shall dwell in their own land .
and it was about the sixth hour , and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour .
mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets ; all my bones shake ; i am like a drunken man , and like a man whom wine hath overcome , because of the lord , and because of the words of his holiness .
in his days judah shall be saved , and israel shall dwell safely : and this is his name whereby he shall be called , the lord our righteousness .
and when jesus had cried with a loud voice , he said , father , into thy hands i commend my spirit : and having said thus , he gave up the ghost .
therefore , behold , the days come , saith the lord , that they shall no more say , the lord liveth , which brought up the children of israel out of the land of egypt ;
now when the centurion saw what was done , he glorified god , saying , certainly this was a righteous man .
and all the people that came together to that sight , beholding the things which were done , smote their breasts , and returned .
and all his acquaintance , and the women that followed him from galilee , stood afar off , beholding these things .
and there were made on them , on the doors of the temple , cherubims and palm trees , like as were made upon the walls ; and there were thick planks upon the face of the porch without .
woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture ! saith the lord .
and there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side , on the sides of the porch , and upon the side chambers of the house , and thick planks .
and the doors had two leaves apiece , two turning leaves ; two leaves for the one door , and two leaves for the other door .
then shall they begin to say to the mountains , fall on us ; and to the hills , cover us .
he took not away the pillar of the cloud by day , nor the pillar of fire by night , from before the people .
for if they do these things in a green tree , what shall be done in the dry ?
and they took their journey from succoth , and encamped in etham , in the edge of the wilderness .
and the lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud , to lead them the way ; and by night in a pillar of fire , to give them light ; to go by day and night :
then said jesus , father , forgive them ; for they know not what they do . and they parted his raiment , and cast lots .
and the people stood beholding . and the rulers also with them derided him , saying , he saved others ; let him save himself , if he be christ , the chosen of god .
and there were also two other , malefactors , led with him to be put to death .
and when they were come to the place , which is called calvary , there they crucified him , and the malefactors , one on the right hand , and the other on the left .
and a superscription also was written over him in letters of greek , and latin , and hebrew , this is the king of the jews .
and one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him , saying , if thou be christ , save thyself and us .
and the soldiers also mocked him , coming to him , and offering him vinegar ,
and saying , if thou be the king of the jews , save thyself .
then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah in tahpanhes , saying ,
take great stones in thine hand , and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln , which is at the entry of pharaoh ' s house in tahpanhes , in the sight of the men of judah ;
so johanan the son of kareah , and all the captains of the forces , and all the people , obeyed not the voice of the lord , to dwell in the land of judah .
but johanan the son of kareah , and all the captains of the forces , took all the remnant of judah , that were returned from all nations , whither they had been driven , to dwell in the land of judah ;
even men , and women , and children , and the king ' s daughters , and every person that nebuzar - adan the captain of the guard had left with gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan , and jeremiah the prophet , and baruch the son of neriah .
so they came into the land of egypt : for they obeyed not the voice of the lord : thus came they even to tahpanhes .
and it came to pass , that when jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the lord their god , for which the lord their god had sent him to them , even all these words ,
then spake azariah the son of hoshaiah , and johanan the son of kareah , and all the proud men , saying unto jeremiah , thou speakest falsely : the lord our god hath not sent thee to say , go not into egypt to sojourn there :
but baruch the son of neriah setteth thee on against us , for to deliver us into the hand of the chaldeans , that they might put us to death , and carry us away captives into babylon .
what shall we say then ? shall we continue in sin , that grace may abound ?
now if we be dead with christ , we believe that we shall also live with him :
knowing that christ being raised from the dead dieth no more ; death hath no more dominion over him .
knowing this , that our old man is crucified with him , that the body of sin might be destroyed , that henceforth we should not serve sin .
and that day was the preparation , and the sabbath drew on .
for he that is dead is freed from sin .
and the women also , which came with him from galilee , followed after , and beheld the sepulchre , and how his body was laid .
therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death : that like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father , even so we also should walk in newness of life .
this man went unto pilate , and begged the body of jesus .
for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death , we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection :
and he took it down , and wrapped it in linen , and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone , wherein never man before was laid .
god forbid . how shall we , that are dead to sin , live any longer therein ?
and , behold , there was a man named joseph , a counseller ; and he was a good man , and a just :
know ye not , that so many of us as were baptized into jesus christ were baptized into his death ?
( the same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them ; ) he was of arimathaea , a city of the jews : who also himself waited for the kingdom of god .
out of jacob shall come he that shall have dominion , and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city .
certain men , the children of belial , are gone out from among you , and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city , saying , let us go and serve other gods , which ye have not known ;
then shalt thou inquire , and make search , and ask diligently ; and , behold , if it be truth , and the thing certain , that such abomination is wrought among you ;
thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword , destroying it utterly , and all that is therein , and the cattle thereof , with the edge of the sword .
and thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street thereof , and shalt burn with fire the city , and all the spoil thereof every whit , for the lord thy god : and it shall be an heap for ever ; it shall not be built again .
and ships shall come from the coast of chittim , and shall afflict asshur , and shall afflict eber , and he also shall perish for ever .
and there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand : that the lord may turn from the fierceness of his anger , and shew thee mercy , and have compassion upon thee , and multiply thee , as he hath sworn unto thy fathers ;
and balaam rose up , and went and returned to his place : and balak also went his way .
when thou shalt hearken to the voice of the lord thy god , to keep all his commandments which i command thee this day , to do that which is right in the eyes of the lord thy god .
nevertheless the kenite shall be wasted , until asshur shall carry thee away captive .
and he took up his parable , and said , alas , who shall live when god doeth this !
and when he looked on amalek , he took up his parable , and said , amalek was the first of the nations ; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever .
and he looked on the kenites , and took up his parable , and said , strong is thy dwellingplace , and thou puttest thy nest in a rock .
and thou shalt stone him with stones , that he die ; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the lord thy god , which brought thee out of the land of egypt , from the house of bondage .
and all israel shall hear , and fear , and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is among you .
if thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities , which the lord thy god hath given thee to dwell there , saying ,
and every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb ; and if thou wilt not redeem it , then thou shalt break his neck : and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem .
and it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come , saying , what is this ? that thou shalt say unto him , by strength of hand the lord brought us out from egypt , from the house of bondage :
and it shall be for a token upon thine hand , and for frontlets between thine eyes : for by strength of hand the lord brought us forth out of egypt .
and it came to pass , when pharaoh had let the people go , that god led them not through the way of the land of the philistines , although that was near ; for god said , lest peradventure the people repent when they see war , and they return to egypt :
but god led the people about , through the way of the wilderness of the red sea : and the children of israel went up harnessed out of the land of egypt .
and moses took the bones of joseph with him : for he had straitly sworn the children of israel , saying , god will surely visit you ; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you .
therefore now flee thou to thy place : i thought to promote thee unto great honour ; but , lo , the lord hath kept thee back from honour .
keep me from the snares which they have laid for me , and the gins of the workers of iniquity .
for , behold , the days are coming , in the which they shall say , blessed are the barren , and the wombs that never bare , and the paps which never gave suck .
and balaam said unto balak , spake i not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me , saying ,
but mine eyes are unto thee , o god the lord : in thee is my trust ; leave not my soul destitute .
if balak would give me his house full of silver and gold , i cannot go beyond the commandment of the lord , to do either good or bad of mine own mind ; but what the lord saith , that will i speak ?
and now , behold , i go unto my people : come therefore , and i will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days .
and as they led him away , they laid hold upon one simon , a cyrenian , coming out of the country , and on him they laid the cross , that he might bear it after jesus .
and he took up his parable , and said , balaam the son of beor hath said , and the man whose eyes are open hath said :
let the righteous smite me ; it shall be a kindness : and let him reprove me ; it shall be an excellent oil , which shall not break my head : for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities .
and he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison , whom they had desired ; but he delivered jesus to their will .
he hath said , which heard the words of god , and knew the knowledge of the most high , which saw the vision of the almighty , falling into a trance , but having his eyes open :
incline not my heart to any evil thing , to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity : and let me not eat of their dainties .
but jesus turning unto them said , daughters of jerusalem , weep not for me , but weep for yourselves , and for your children .
i shall see him , but not now : i shall behold him , but not nigh : there shall come a star out of jacob , and a sceptre shall rise out of israel , and shall smite the corners of moab , and destroy all the children of sheth .
our bones are scattered at the grave ' s mouth , as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth .
and there followed him a great company of people , and of women , which also bewailed and lamented him .
and edom shall be a possession , seir also shall be a possession for his enemies ; and israel shall do valiantly .
when their judges are overthrown in stony places , they shall hear my words ; for they are sweet .
and he said unto them the third time , why , what evil hath he done ? i have found no cause of death in him : i will therefore chastise him , and let him go .
lord , i cry unto thee : make haste unto me ; give ear unto my voice , when i cry unto thee .
but they cried , saying , crucify him , crucify him .
and pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required .
and they were instant with loud voices , requiring that he might be crucified . and the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed .
let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense ; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice .
thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year .
pilate therefore , willing to release jesus , spake again to them .
and it shall be when the lord shall bring thee into the land of the canaanites , as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers , and shall give it thee ,
and balak ' s anger was kindled against balaam , and he smote his hands together : and balak said unto balaam , i called thee to curse mine enemies , and , behold , thou hast altogether blessed them these three times .
so he measured the house , an hundred cubits long ; and the separate place , and the building , with the walls thereof , an hundred cubits long ;
now the building that was before the separate place at the end toward the west was seventy cubits broad ; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about , and the length thereof ninety cubits .
( who for a certain sedition made in the city , and for murder , was cast into prison . )
and he measured the length of the building over against the separate place which was behind it , and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side , an hundred cubits , with the inner temple , and the porches of the court ;
and they cried out all at once , saying , away with this man , and release unto us barabbas :
also the breadth of the face of the house , and of the separate place toward the east , an hundred cubits .
( for of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast . )
to that above the door , even unto the inner house , and without , and by all the wall round about within and without , by measure .
i will therefore chastise him , and release him .
the door posts , and the narrow windows , and the galleries round about on their three stories , over against the door , cieled with wood round about , and from the ground up to the windows , and the windows were covered ;
no , nor yet herod : for i sent you to him ; and , lo , nothing worthy of death is done unto him .
so that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one side , and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side : it was made through all the house round about .
said unto them , ye have brought this man unto me , as one that perverteth the people : and , behold , i , having examined him before you , have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him :
and it was made with cherubims and palm trees , so that a palm tree was between a cherub and a cherub ; and every cherub had two faces ;
and pilate , when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people ,
and the same day pilate and herod were made friends together : for before they were at enmity between themselves .
and herod with his men of war set him at nought , and mocked him , and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe , and sent him again to pilate .
and the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him .
and between the chambers was the wideness of twenty cubits round about the house on every side .
knowing that he that is such is subverted , and sinneth , being condemned of himself .
when i shall send artemas unto thee , or tychicus , be diligent to come unto me to nicopolis : for i have determined there to winter .
a man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject ;
all that are with me salute thee . greet them that love us in the faith . grace be with you all . amen .
bring zenas the lawyer and apollos on their journey diligently , that nothing be wanting unto them .
and let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses , that they be not unfruitful .
a time to rend , and a time to sew ; a time to keep silence , and a time to speak ;
a time to get , and a time to lose ; a time to keep , and a time to cast away ;
a time to cast away stones , and a time to gather stones together ; a time to embrace , and a time to refrain from embracing ;
a time to weep , and a time to laugh ; a time to mourn , and a time to dance ;
a time to kill , and a time to heal ; a time to break down , and a time to build up ;
and the spirit of the lord began to move him at times in the camp of dan between zorah and eshtaol .
a time to be born , and a time to die ; a time to plant , and a time to pluck up that which is planted ;
and the woman bare a son , and called his name samson : and the child grew , and the lord blessed him .
but his wife said unto him , if the lord were pleased to kill us , he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands , neither would he have shewed us all these things , nor would as at this time have told us such things as these .
what profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth ?
a time to love , and a time to hate ; a time of war , and a time of peace .
and there is none that calleth upon thy name , that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee : for thou hast hid thy face from us , and hast consumed us , because of our iniquities .
but now , o lord , thou art our father ; we are the clay , and thou our potter ; and we all are the work of thy hand .
thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness , those that remember thee in thy ways : behold , thou art wroth ; for we have sinned : in those is continuance , and we shall be saved .
but we are all as an unclean thing , and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags ; and we all do fade as a leaf ; and our iniquities , like the wind , have taken us away .
be not wroth very sore , o lord , neither remember iniquity for ever : behold , see , we beseech thee , we are all thy people .
for it came to pass , when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar , that the angel of the lord ascended in the flame of the altar . and manoah and his wife looked on it , and fell on their faces to the ground .
but the angel of the lord did no more appear to manoah and to his wife . then manoah knew that he was an angel of the lord .
and manoah said unto his wife , we shall surely die , because we have seen god .
when thou didst terrible things which we looked not for , thou camest down , the mountains flowed down at thy presence .
for since the beginning of the world men have not heard , nor perceived by the ear , neither hath the eye seen , o god , beside thee , what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him .
oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens , that thou wouldest come down , that the mountains might flow down at thy presence ,
as when the melting fire burneth , the fire causeth the waters to boil , to make thy name known to thine adversaries , that the nations may tremble at thy presence !
and the angel of the lord said unto manoah , though thou detain me , i will not eat of thy bread : and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering , thou must offer it unto the lord . for manoah knew not that he was an angel of the lord .
so manoah took a kid with a meat offering , and offered it upon a rock unto the lord : and the angel did wondrously ; and manoah and his wife looked on .
and the angel of the lord said unto him , why askest thou thus after my name , seeing it is secret ?
and manoah said , now let thy words come to pass . how shall we order the child , and how shall we do unto him ?
and manoah said unto the angel of the lord , i pray thee , let us detain thee , until we shall have made ready a kid for thee .
she may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine , neither let her drink wine or strong drink , nor eat any unclean thing : all that i commanded her let her observe .
at that time will i bring you again , even in the time that i gather you : for i will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth , when i turn back your captivity before your eyes , saith the lord .
now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel , and the preaching of jesus christ , according to the revelation of the mystery , which was kept secret since the world began ,
but now is made manifest , and by the scriptures of the prophets , according to the commandment of the everlasting god , made known to all nations for the obedience of faith :
gaius mine host , and of the whole church , saluteth you . erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you , and quartus a brother .
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all . amen .
to god only wise , be glory through jesus christ for ever . amen .
there was a certain rich man , which was clothed in purple and fine linen , and fared sumptuously every day :
whosoever putteth away his wife , and marrieth another , committeth adultery : and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery .
no servant can serve two masters : for either he will hate the one , and love the other ; or else he will hold to the one , and despise the other . ye cannot serve god and mammon .
and if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man ' s , who shall give you that which is your own ?
from beyond the rivers of ethiopia my suppliants , even the daughter of my dispersed , shall bring mine offering .
if therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon , who will commit to your trust the true riches ?
he that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much : and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much .
and the god of peace shall bruise satan under your feet shortly . the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you . amen .
and it is easier for heaven and earth to pass , than one tittle of the law to fail .
the law and the prophets were until john : since that time the kingdom of god is preached , and every man presseth into it .
i tertius , who wrote this epistle , salute you in the lord .
and he said unto them , ye are they which justify yourselves before men ; but god knoweth your hearts : for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of god .
timotheus my workfellow , and lucius , and jason , and sosipater , my kinsmen , salute you .
and the pharisees also , who were covetous , heard all these things : and they derided him .
salute tryphena and tryphosa , who labour in the lord . salute the beloved persis , which laboured much in the lord .
i will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly , who are of thee , to whom the reproach of it was a burden .
salute rufus chosen in the lord , and his mother and mine .
the lord thy god in the midst of thee is mighty ; he will save , he will rejoice over thee with joy ; he will rest in his love , he will joy over thee with singing .
salute asyncritus , phlegon , hermas , patrobas , hermes , and the brethren which are with them .
in that day it shall be said to jerusalem , fear thou not : and to zion , let not thine hands be slack .
salute philologus , and julia , nereus , and his sister , and olympas , and all the saints which are with them .
the lord hath taken away thy judgments , he hath cast out thine enemy : the king of israel , even the lord , is in the midst of thee : thou shalt not see evil any more .
salute one another with an holy kiss . the churches of christ salute you .
sing , o daughter of zion ; shout , o israel ; be glad and rejoice with all the heart , o daughter of jerusalem .
now i beseech you , brethren , mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned ; and avoid them .
for they that are such serve not our lord jesus christ , but their own belly ; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple .
i will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people , and they shall trust in the name of the lord .
for your obedience is come abroad unto all men . i am glad therefore on your behalf : but yet i would have you wise unto that which is good , and simple concerning evil .
in that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings , wherein thou hast transgressed against me : for then i will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride , and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain .
behold , at that time i will undo all that afflict thee : and i will save her that halteth , and gather her that was driven out ; and i will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame .
salute herodion my kinsman . greet them that be of the household of narcissus , which are in the lord .
and elijah said unto him , elisha , tarry here , i pray thee ; for the lord hath sent me to jericho . and he said , as the lord liveth , and as thy soul liveth , i will not leave thee . so they came to jericho .
salute apelles approved in christ . salute them which are of aristobulus ' household .
and the sons of the prophets that were at jericho came to elisha , and said unto him , knowest thou that the lord will take away thy master from thy head to day ? and he answered , yea , i know it ; hold ye your peace .
and elijah said unto elisha , tarry here , i pray thee ; for the lord hath sent me to bethel . and elisha said unto him , as the lord liveth , and as thy soul liveth , i will not leave thee . so they went down to bethel .
and the sons of the prophets that were at bethel came forth to elisha , and said unto him , knowest thou that the lord will take away thy master from thy head to day ? and he said , yea , i know it ; hold ye your peace .
and it came to pass , when the lord would take up elijah into heaven by a whirlwind , that elijah went with elisha from gilgal .
and it came to pass , when they were gone over , that elijah said unto elisha , ask what i shall do for thee , before i be taken away from thee . and elisha said , i pray thee , let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me .
and fifty men of the sons of the prophets went , and stood to view afar off : and they two stood by jordan .
and elijah said unto him , tarry , i pray thee , here ; for the lord hath sent me to jordan . and he said , as the lord liveth , and as thy soul liveth , i will not leave thee . and they two went on .
and all that have not fins and scales in the seas , and in the rivers , of all that move in the waters , and of any living thing which is in the waters , they shall be an abomination unto you :
they shall be even an abomination unto you ; ye shall not eat of their flesh , but ye shall have their carcases in abomination .
whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters , that shall be an abomination unto you .
and these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the fowls ; they shall not be eaten , they are an abomination : the eagle , and the ossifrage , and the ospray ,
and the vulture , and the kite after his kind ;
every raven after his kind ;
and the owl , and the night hawk , and the cuckow , and the hawk after his kind ,
and the little owl , and the cormorant , and the great owl ,
and the swan , and the pelican , and the gier eagle ,
and the stork , the heron after her kind , and the lapwing , and the bat .
all fowls that creep , going upon all four , shall be an abomination unto you .
these also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth ; the weasel , and the mouse , and the tortoise after his kind ,
the carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof , and is not clovenfooted , nor cheweth the cud , are unclean unto you : every one that toucheth them shall be unclean .
and whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even .
and he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even : they are unclean unto you .
and whatsoever goeth upon his paws , among all manner of beasts that go on all four , those are unclean unto you : whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even .
even these of them ye may eat ; the locust after his kind , and the bald locust after his kind , and the beetle after his kind , and the grasshopper after his kind .
yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon all four , which have legs above their feet , to leap withal upon the earth ;
and for these ye shall be unclean : whosoever toucheth the carcase of them shall be unclean until the even .
but all other flying creeping things , which have four feet , shall be an abomination unto you .
and of the sons of bebai ; zechariah the son of bebai , and with him twenty and eight males .
and the ferret , and the chameleon , and the lizard , and the snail , and the mole .
when the host goeth forth against thine enemies , then keep thee from every wicked thing .
and of the sons of shelomith ; the son of josiphiah , and with him an hundred and threescore males .
these are unclean to you among all that creep : whosoever doth touch them , when they be dead , shall be unclean until the even .
thou shalt not abhor an edomite ; for he is thy brother : thou shalt not abhor an egyptian ; because thou wast a stranger in his land .
the children that are begotten of them shall enter into the congregation of the lord in their third generation .
of the sons also of bigvai ; uthai , and zabbud , and with them seventy males .
and of the last sons of adonikam , whose names are these , eliphelet , jeiel , and shemaiah , and with them threescore males .
and of the sons of azgad ; johanan the son of hakkatan , and with him an hundred and ten males .
to another the working of miracles ; to another prophecy ; to another discerning of spirits ; to another divers kinds of tongues ; to another the interpretation of tongues :
and hashabiah , and with him jeshaiah of the sons of merari , his brethren and their sons , twenty ;
then sent i for eliezer , for ariel , for shemaiah , and for elnathan , and for jarib , and for elnathan , and for nathan , and for zechariah , and for meshullam , chief men ; also for joiarib , and for elnathan , men of understanding .
if the whole body were an eye , where were the hearing ? if the whole were hearing , where were the smelling ?
but now hath god set the members every one of them in the body , as it hath pleased him .
if the foot shall say , because i am not the hand , i am not of the body ; is it therefore not of the body ?
and if the ear shall say , because i am not the eye , i am not of the body ; is it therefore not of the body ?
for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body , whether we be jews or gentiles , whether we be bond or free ; and have been all made to drink into one spirit .
for the body is not one member , but many .
but all these worketh that one and the selfsame spirit , dividing to every man severally as he will .
for as the body is one , and hath many members , and all the members of that one body , being many , are one body : so also is christ .
and if any beast , of which ye may eat , die ; he that toucheth the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even .
a bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the lord ; even to his tenth generation shall he not enter into the congregation of the lord .
but if any water be put upon the seed , and any part of their carcase fall thereon , it shall be unclean unto you .
he that is wounded in the stones , or hath his privy member cut off , shall not enter into the congregation of the lord .
and if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown , it shall be clean .
and every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth shall be unclean ; whether it be oven , or ranges for pots , they shall be broken down : for they are unclean , and shall be unclean unto you .
thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for ever .
of all meat which may be eaten , that on which such water cometh shall be unclean : and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel shall be unclean .
nevertheless the lord thy god would not hearken unto balaam ; but the lord thy god turned the curse into a blessing unto thee , because the lord thy god loved thee .
and if they were all one member , where were the body ?
and every earthen vessel , whereinto any of them falleth , whatsoever is in it shall be unclean ; and ye shall break it .
because they met you not with bread and with water in the way , when ye came forth out of egypt ; and because they hired against thee balaam the son of beor of pethor of mesopotamia , to curse thee .
an ammonite or moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the lord ; even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the congregation of the lord for ever :
then i separated twelve of the chief of the priests , sherebiah , hashabiah , and ten of their brethren with them ,
so we fasted and besought our god for this : and he was intreated of us .
i even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver , and silver vessels an hundred talents , and of gold an hundred talents ;
and weighed unto them the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , even the offering of the house of our god , which the king , and his counsellers , and his lords , and all israel there present , had offered :
also of the nethinims , whom david and the princes had appointed for the service of the levites , two hundred and twenty nethinims : all of them were expressed by name .
and gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan sware unto them and to their men , saying , fear not to serve the chaldeans : dwell in the land , and serve the king of babylon , and it shall be well with you .
and he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even : he also that beareth the carcase of it shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even .
and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be an abomination ; it shall not be eaten .
then i proclaimed a fast there , at the river of ahava , that we might afflict ourselves before our god , to seek of him a right way for us , and for our little ones , and for all our substance .
whatsoever goeth upon the belly , and whatsoever goeth upon all four , or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth , them ye shall not eat ; for they are an abomination .
then they came to gedaliah to mizpah , even ishmael the son of nethaniah , and johanan and jonathan the sons of kareah , and seraiah the son of tanhumeth , and the sons of ephai the netophathite , and jezaniah the son of a maachathite , they and their men .
and there was a certain beggar named lazarus , which was laid at his gate , full of sores ,
then went jeremiah unto gedaliah the son of ahikam to mizpah ; and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land .
now the lord hath brought it , and done according as he hath said : because ye have sinned against the lord , and have not obeyed his voice , therefore this thing is come upon you .
the word that came to jeremiah from the lord , after that nebuzar - adan the captain of the guard had let him go from ramah , when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of jerusalem and judah , which were carried away captive unto babylon .
also twenty basons of gold , of a thousand drams ; and two vessels of fine copper , precious as gold .
and the captain of the guard took jeremiah , and said unto him , the lord thy god hath pronounced this evil upon this place .
and the eye cannot say unto the hand , i have no need of thee : nor again the head to the feet , i have no need of you .
watch ye , and keep them , until ye weigh them before the chief of the priests and the levites , and chief of the fathers of israel , at jerusalem , in the chambers of the house of the lord .
nay , much more those members of the body , which seem to be more feeble , are necessary :
then he said , i pray thee therefore , father , that thou wouldest send him to my father ' s house :
and those members of the body , which we think to be less honourable , upon these we bestow more abundant honour ; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness .
for i have five brethren ; that he may testify unto them , lest they also come into this place of torment .
but abraham said , son , remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things , and likewise lazarus evil things : but now he is comforted , and thou art tormented .
that there should be no schism in the body ; but that the members should have the same care one for another .
and beside all this , between us and you there is a great gulf fixed : so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot ; neither can they pass to us , that would come from thence .
and whether one member suffer , all the members suffer with it ; or one member be honoured , all the members rejoice with it .
and in hell he lift up his eyes , being in torments , and seeth abraham afar off , and lazarus in his bosom .
now ye are the body of christ , and members in particular .
and god hath set some in the church , first apostles , secondarily prophets , thirdly teachers , after that miracles , then gifts of healings , helps , governments , diversities of tongues .
and desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man ' s table : moreover the dogs came and licked his sores .
and , behold , the man clothed with linen , which had the inkhorn by his side , reported the matter , saying , i have done as thou hast commanded me .
are all apostles ? are all prophets ? are all teachers ? are all workers of miracles ?
and it came to pass , that the beggar died , and was carried by the angels into abraham ' s bosom : the rich man also died , and was buried ;
and as for me also , mine eye shall not spare , neither will i have pity , but i will recompense their way upon their head .
for i am the lord your god : ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves , and ye shall be holy ; for i am holy : neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth .
ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth , neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them , that ye should be defiled thereby .
for i am the lord that bringeth you up out of the land of egypt , to be your god : ye shall therefore be holy , for i am holy .
to make a difference between the unclean and the clean , and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten .
abraham saith unto him , they have moses and the prophets ; let them hear them .
by number and by weight of every one : and all the weight was written at that time .
and we came to jerusalem , and abode there three days .
then we departed from the river of ahava on the twelfth day of the first month , to go unto jerusalem : and the hand of our god was upon us , and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy , and of such as lay in wait by the way .
and he said unto him , if they hear not moses and the prophets , neither will they be persuaded , though one rose from the dead .
and he said , nay , father abraham : but if one went unto them from the dead , they will repent .
but covet earnestly the best gifts : and yet shew i unto you a more excellent way .
have all the gifts of healing ? do all speak with tongues ? do all interpret ?
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
speak unto the children of israel , and say unto them , concerning the feasts of the lord , which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations , even these are my feasts .
six days shall work be done : but the seventh day is the sabbath of rest , an holy convocation ; ye shall do no work therein : it is the sabbath of the lord in all your dwellings .
these are the feasts of the lord , even holy convocations , which ye shall proclaim in their seasons .
in the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the lord ' s passover .
and on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the lord : seven days ye must eat unleavened bread .
in the first day ye shall have an holy convocation : ye shall do no servile work therein .
but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the lord seven days : in the seventh day is an holy convocation : ye shall do no servile work therein .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
the word of the lord that came to micah the morasthite in the days of jotham , ahaz , and hezekiah , kings of judah , which he saw concerning samaria and jerusalem .
for , behold , the lord cometh forth out of his place , and will come down , and tread upon the high places of the earth .
hear , all ye people ; hearken , o earth , and all that therein is : and let the lord god be witness against you , the lord from his holy temple .
for the transgression of jacob is all this , and for the sins of the house of israel . what is the transgression of jacob ? is it not samaria ? and what are the high places of judah ? are they not jerusalem ?
and the mountains shall be molten under him , and the valleys shall be cleft , as wax before the fire , and as the waters that are poured down a steep place .
and all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces , and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire , and all the idols thereof will i lay desolate : for she gathered it of the hire of an harlot , and they shall return to the hire of an harlot .
therefore i will make samaria as an heap of the field , and as plantings of a vineyard : and i will pour down the stones thereof into the valley , and i will discover the foundations thereof .
for her wound is incurable ; for it is come unto judah ; he is come unto the gate of my people , even to jerusalem .
therefore i will wail and howl , i will go stripped and naked : i will make a wailing like the dragons , and mourning as the owls .
ye said also , behold , what a weariness is it ! and ye have snuffed at it , saith the lord of hosts ; and ye brought that which was torn , and the lame , and the sick ; thus ye brought an offering : should i accept this of your hand ? saith the lord .
but ye have profaned it , in that ye say , the table of the lord is polluted ; and the fruit thereof , even his meat , is contemptible .
but cursed be the deceiver , which hath in his flock a male , and voweth , and sacrificeth unto the lord a corrupt thing : for i am a great king , saith the lord of hosts , and my name is dreadful among the heathen .
and miriam the prophetess , the sister of aaron , took a timbrel in her hand ; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances .
and miriam answered them , sing ye to the lord , for he hath triumphed gloriously ; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea .
so moses brought israel from the red sea , and they went out into the wilderness of shur ; and they went three days in the wilderness , and found no water .
and when they came to marah , they could not drink of the waters of marah , for they were bitter : therefore the name of it was called marah .
and the people murmured against moses , saying , what shall we drink ?
and he cried unto the lord ; and the lord shewed him a tree , which when he had cast into the waters , the waters were made sweet : there he made for them a statute and an ordinance , and there he proved them ,
and they came to elim , where were twelve wells of water , and threescore and ten palm trees : and they encamped there by the waters .
but when the first came , they supposed that they should have received more ; and they likewise received every man a penny .
saying , these last have wrought but one hour , and thou hast made them equal unto us , which have borne the burden and heat of the day .
and jesus going up to jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way , and said unto them ,
behold , we go up to jerusalem ; and the son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes , and they shall condemn him to death ,
and shall deliver him to the gentiles to mock , and to scourge , and to crucify him : and the third day he shall rise again .
take that thine is , and go thy way : i will give unto this last , even as unto thee .
is it not lawful for me to do what i will with mine own ? is thine eye evil , because i am good ?
but jesus answered and said , ye know not what ye ask . are ye able to drink of the cup that i shall drink of , and to be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with ? they say unto him , we are able .
then came to him the mother of zebedee ' s children with her sons , worshipping him , and desiring a certain thing of him .
and he said unto her , what wilt thou ? she saith unto him , grant that these my two sons may sit , the one on thy right hand , and the other on the left , in thy kingdom .
even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto , but to minister , and to give his life a ransom for many .
and as they departed from jericho , a great multitude followed him .
but it shall not be so among you : but whosoever will be great among you , let him be your minister ;
and when the ten heard it , they were moved with indignation against the two brethren .
but jesus called them unto him , and said , ye know that the princes of the gentiles exercise dominion over them , and they that are great exercise authority upon them .
so then if , while her husband liveth , she be married to another man , she shall be called an adulteress : but if her husband be dead , she is free from that law ; so that she is no adulteress , though she be married to another man .
wherefore , my brethren , ye also are become dead to the law by the body of christ ; that ye should be married to another , even to him who is raised from the dead , that we should bring forth fruit unto god .
know ye not , brethren , ( for i speak to them that know the law , ) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth ?
for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth ; but if the husband be dead , she is loosed from the law of her husband .
blessed be the lord , who daily loadeth us with benefits , even the god of our salvation . selah .
what shall we say then ? is the law sin ? god forbid . nay , i had not known sin , but by the law : for i had not known lust , except the law had said , thou shalt not covet .
but sin , taking occasion by the commandment , wrought in me all manner of concupiscence . for without the law sin was dead .
for when we were in the flesh , the motions of sins , which were by the law , did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death .
but now we are delivered from the law , that being dead wherein we were held ; that we should serve in newness of spirit , and not in the oldness of the letter .
when the almighty scattered kings in it , it was white as snow in salmon .
though ye have lien among the pots , yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver , and her feathers with yellow gold .
for i was alive without the law once : but when the commandment came , sin revived , and i died .
kings of armies did flee apace : and she that tarried at home divided the spoil .
the lord gave the word : great was the company of those that published it .
thou hast ascended on high , thou hast led captivity captive : thou hast received gifts for men ; yea , for the rebellious also , that the lord god might dwell among them .
the chariots of god are twenty thousand , even thousands of angels : the lord is among them , as in sinai , in the holy place .
why leap ye , ye high hills ? this is the hill which god desireth to dwell in ; yea , the lord will dwell in it for ever .
the hill of god is as the hill of bashan ; an high hill as the hill of bashan .
and , behold , two blind men sitting by the way side , when they heard that jesus passed by , cried out , saying , have mercy on us , o lord , thou son of david .
and the multitude rebuked them , because they should hold their peace : but they cried the more , saying , have mercy on us , o lord , thou son of david .
thy congregation hath dwelt therein : thou , o god , hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor .
and jesus stood still , and called them , and said , what will ye that i shall do unto you ?
they say unto him , lord , that our eyes may be opened .
so jesus had compassion on them , and touched their eyes : and immediately their eyes received sight , and they followed him .
tell ye , and bring them near ; yea , let them take counsel together : who hath declared this from ancient time ? who hath told it from that time ? have not i the lord ? and there is no god else beside me ; a just god and a saviour ; there is none beside me .
assemble yourselves and come ; draw near together , ye that are escaped of the nations : they have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven image , and pray unto a god that cannot save .
i have sworn by myself , the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness , and shall not return , that unto me every knee shall bow , every tongue shall swear .
look unto me , and be ye saved , all the ends of the earth : for i am god , and there is none else .
in the lord shall all the seed of israel be justified , and shall glory .
surely , shall one say , in the lord have i righteousness and strength : even to him shall men come ; and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed .
i have not spoken in secret , in a dark place of the earth : i said not unto the seed of jacob , seek ye me in vain : i the lord speak righteousness , i declare things that are right .
but israel shall be saved in the lord with an everlasting salvation : ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end .
for thus saith the lord that created the heavens ; god himself that formed the earth and made it ; he hath established it , he created it not in vain , he formed it to be inhabited : i am the lord ; and there is none else .
thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed : thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation .
the people shall hear , and be afraid : sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of palestina .
who is like unto thee , o lord , among the gods ? who is like thee , glorious in holiness , fearful in praises , doing wonders ?
thou stretchedst out thy right hand , the earth swallowed them .
thou didst blow with thy wind , the sea covered them : they sank as lead in the mighty waters .
for the horse of pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea , and the lord brought again the waters of the sea upon them ; but the children of israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea .
the lord shall reign for ever and ever .
thou shalt bring them in , and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance , in the place , o lord , which thou hast made for thee to dwell in , in the sanctuary , o lord , which thy hands have established .
fear and dread shall fall upon them ; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone ; till thy people pass over , o lord , till the people pass over , which thou hast purchased .
then the dukes of edom shall be amazed ; the mighty men of moab , trembling shall take hold upon them ; all the inhabitants of canaan shall melt away .
i have made the earth , and created man upon it : i , even my hands , have stretched out the heavens , and all their host have i commanded .
thus saith the lord , the holy one of israel , and his maker , ask me of things to come concerning my sons , and concerning the work of my hands command ye me .
woe unto him that saith unto his father , what begettest thou ? or to the woman , what hast thou brought forth ?
they shall be ashamed , and also confounded , all of them : they shall go to confusion together that are makers of idols .
verily thou art a god that hidest thyself , o god of israel , the saviour .
i have raised him up in righteousness , and i will direct all his ways : he shall build my city , and he shall let go my captives , not for price nor reward , saith the lord of hosts .
so likewise ye , when ye see these things come to pass , know ye that the kingdom of god is nigh at hand .
when they now shoot forth , ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand .
heaven and earth shall pass away : but my words shall not pass away .
verily i say unto you , this generation shall not pass away , till all be fulfilled .
and all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple , for to hear him .
for as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth .
and take heed to yourselves , lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting , and drunkenness , and cares of this life , and so that day come upon you unawares .
and in the day time he was teaching in the temple ; and at night he went out , and abode in the mount that is called the mount of olives .
and as the evil figs , which cannot be eaten , they are so evil ; surely thus saith the lord , so will i give zedekiah the king of judah , and his princes , and the residue of jerusalem , that remain in this land , and them that dwell in the land of egypt :
and i will give them an heart to know me , that i am the lord : and they shall be my people , and i will be their god : for they shall return unto me with their whole heart .
for i will set mine eyes upon them for good , and i will bring them again to this land : and i will build them , and not pull them down ; and i will plant them , and not pluck them up .
in the day of prosperity be joyful , but in the day of adversity consider : god also hath set the one over against the other , to the end that man should find nothing after him .
again the word of the lord came unto me , saying ,
consider the work of god : for who can make that straight , which he hath made crooked ?
then said the lord unto me , what seest thou , jeremiah ? and i said , figs ; the good figs , very good ; and the evil , very evil , that cannot be eaten , they are so evil .
for wisdom is a defence , and money is a defence : but the excellency of knowledge is , that wisdom giveth life to them that have it .
one basket had very good figs , even like the figs that are first ripe : and the other basket had very naughty figs , which could not be eaten , they were so bad .
wisdom is good with an inheritance : and by it there is profit to them that see the sun .
be not over much wicked , neither be thou foolish : why shouldest thou die before thy time ?
it is good that thou shouldest take hold of this ; yea , also from this withdraw not thine hand : for he that feareth god shall come forth of them all .
be not righteous over much ; neither make thyself over wise : why shouldest thou destroy thyself ?
wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city .
and i will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for their hurt , to be a reproach and a proverb , a taunt and a curse , in all places whither i shall drive them .
and great earthquakes shall be in divers places , and famines , and pestilences ; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven .
then said he unto them , nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom :
and it shall turn to you for a testimony .
all this have i proved by wisdom : i said , i will be wise ; but it was far from me .
but before all these , they shall lay their hands on you , and persecute you , delivering you up to the synagogues , and into prisons , being brought before kings and rulers for my name ' s sake .
for oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others .
for i will give you a mouth and wisdom , which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist .
i applied mine heart to know , and to search , and to seek out wisdom , and the reason of things , and to know the wickedness of folly , even of foolishness and madness :
settle it therefore in your hearts , not to meditate before what ye shall answer :
that which is far off , and exceeding deep , who can find it out ?
and ye shall be hated of all men for my name ' s sake .
and ye shall be betrayed both by parents , and brethren , and kinsfolks , and friends ; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death .
in your patience possess ye your souls .
also take no heed unto all words that are spoken ; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee :
but there shall not an hair of your head perish .
for there is not a just man upon earth , that doeth good , and sinneth not .
and i find more bitter than death the woman , whose heart is snares and nets , and her hands as bands : whoso pleaseth god shall escape from her ; but the sinner shall be taken by her .
which yet my soul seeketh , but i find not : one man among a thousand have i found ; but a woman among all those have i not found .
lo , this only have i found , that god hath made man upright ; but they have sought out many inventions .
for these be the days of vengeance , that all things which are written may be fulfilled .
then let them which are in judaea flee to the mountains ; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out ; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto .
and when ye shall see jerusalem compassed with armies , then know that the desolation thereof is nigh .
men ' s hearts failing them for fear , and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth : for the powers of heaven shall be shaken .
and they shall fall by the edge of the sword , and shall be led away captive into all nations : and jerusalem shall be trodden down of the gentiles , until the times of the gentiles be fulfilled .
but woe unto them that are with child , and to them that give suck , in those days ! for there shall be great distress in the land , and wrath upon this people .
and he spake to them a parable ; behold the fig tree , and all the trees ;
and when these things begin to come to pass , then look up , and lift up your heads ; for your redemption draweth nigh .
and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory .
my mouth shall speak the praise of the lord : and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever .
the lord preserveth all them that love him : but all the wicked will he destroy .
at the appointment of aaron and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the gershonites , in all their burdens , and in all their service : and ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their burdens .
say among the heathen that the lord reigneth : the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved : he shall judge the people righteously .
and the hangings of the court , and the hanging for the door of the gate of the court , which is by the tabernacle and by the altar round about , and their cords , and all the instruments of their service , and all that is made for them : so shall they serve .
let the heavens rejoice , and let the earth be glad ; let the sea roar , and the fulness thereof .
and they shall bear the curtains of the tabernacle , and the tabernacle of the congregation , his covering , and the covering of the badgers ' skins that is above upon it , and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation ,
let the field be joyful , and all that is therein : then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice
this is the service of the families of the gershonites , to serve , and for burdens :
before the lord : for he cometh , for he cometh to judge the earth : he shall judge the world with righteousness , and the people with his truth .
as for the sons of merari , thou shalt number them after their families , by the house of their fathers ;
this is the service of the families of the sons of gershon in the tabernacle of the congregation : and their charge shall be under the hand of ithamar the son of aaron the priest .
take also the sum of the sons of gershon , throughout the houses of their fathers , by their families ;
he will fulfil the desire of them that fear him : he also will hear their cry , and will save them .
from thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shalt thou number them ; all that enter in to perform the service , to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation .
but they shall not go in to see when the holy things are covered , lest they die .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
and i have said , i will bring you up out of the affliction of egypt unto the land of the canaanites , and the hittites , and the amorites , and the perizzites , and the hivites , and the jebusites , unto a land flowing with milk and honey .
go , and gather the elders of israel together , and say unto them , the lord god of your fathers , the god of abraham , of isaac , and of jacob , appeared unto me , saying , i have surely visited you , and seen that which is done to you in egypt :
and god said unto moses , i am that i am : and he said , thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel , i am hath sent me unto you .
and moses said unto god , behold , when i come unto the children of israel , and shall say unto them , the god of your fathers hath sent me unto you ; and they shall say to me , what is his name ? what shall i say unto them ?
and he said , certainly i will be with thee ; and this shall be a token unto thee , that i have sent thee : when thou hast brought forth the people out of egypt , ye shall serve god upon this mountain .
and moses said unto god , who am i , that i should go unto pharaoh , and that i should bring forth the children of israel out of egypt ?
come now therefore , and i will send thee unto pharaoh , that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of israel out of egypt .
and those that were numbered of them by their families were two thousand seven hundred and fifty .
from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old , every one that entereth into the service , for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation :
and those that were numbered of the sons of gershon , throughout their families , and by the house of their fathers ,
these were they that were numbered of the families of the kohathites , all that might do service in the tabernacle of the congregation , which moses and aaron did number according to the commandment of the lord by the hand of moses .
from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old , every one that entereth into the service , for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation ,
from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old shalt thou number them , every one that entereth into the service , to do the work of the tabernacle of the congregation .
and this is the charge of their burden , according to all their service in the tabernacle of the congregation ; the boards of the tabernacle , and the bars thereof , and the pillars thereof , and sockets thereof ,
and the pillars of the court round about , and their sockets , and their pins , and their cords , with all their instruments , and with all their service : and by name ye shall reckon the instruments of the charge of their burden .
this is the service of the families of the sons of merari , according to all their service , in the tabernacle of the congregation , under the hand of ithamar the son of aaron the priest .
and moses and aaron and the chief of the congregation numbered the sons of the kohathites after their families , and after the house of their fathers ,
forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor , and ye take from him burdens of wheat : ye have built houses of hewn stone , but ye shall not dwell in them ; ye have planted pleasant vineyards , but ye shall not drink wine of them .
for i know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins : they afflict the just , they take a bribe , and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right .
therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time ; for it is an evil time .
seek good , and not evil , that ye may live : and so the lord , the god of hosts , shall be with you , as ye have spoken .
hate the evil , and love the good , and establish judgment in the gate : it may be that the lord god of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of joseph .
therefore the lord , the god of hosts , the lord , saith thus ; wailing shall be in all streets ; and they shall say in all the highways , alas ! alas ! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning , and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing .
and in all vineyards shall be wailing : for i will pass through thee , saith the lord .
woe unto you that desire the day of the lord ! to what end is it for you ? the day of the lord is darkness , and not light .
as if a man did flee from a lion , and a bear met him ; or went into the house , and leaned his hand on the wall , and a serpent bit him .
they hate him that rebuketh in the gate , and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly .
cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the kohathites from among the levites :
and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron , saying ,
but thus do unto them , that they may live , and not die , when they approach unto the most holy things : aaron and his sons shall go in , and appoint them every one to his service and to his burden :
and they shall put upon it all the vessels thereof , wherewith they minister about it , even the censers , the fleshhooks , and the shovels , and the basons , all the vessels of the altar ; and they shall spread upon it a covering of badgers ' skins , and put to the staves of it .
and they shall take away the ashes from the altar , and spread a purple cloth thereon :
and to the office of eleazar the son of aaron the priest pertaineth the oil for the light , and the sweet incense , and the daily meat offering , and the anointing oil , and the oversight of all the tabernacle , and of all that therein is , in the sanctuary , and in the vessels thereof .
and they shall put it and all the vessels thereof within a covering of badgers ' skins , and shall put it upon a bar .
and upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue , and cover it with a covering of badgers ' skins , and shall put to the staves thereof :
and they shall take all the instruments of ministry , wherewith they minister in the sanctuary , and put them in a cloth of blue , and cover them with a covering of badgers ' skins , and shall put them on a bar :
then i beheld , and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire : from the appearance of his loins even downward , fire ; and from his loins even upward , as the appearance of brightness , as the colour of amber .
for god commanded , saying , honour thy father and mother : and , he that curseth father or mother , let him die the death .
but ye say , whosoever shall say to his father or his mother , it is a gift , by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me ;
and honour not his father or his mother , he shall be free . thus have ye made the commandment of god of none effect by your tradition .
and it came to pass in the sixth year , in the sixth month , in the fifth day of the month , as i sat in mine house , and the elders of judah sat before me , that the hand of the lord god fell there upon me .
ye hypocrites , well did esaias prophesy of you , saying ,
he said furthermore unto me , son of man , seest thou what they do ? even the great abominations that the house of israel committeth here , that i should go far off from my sanctuary ? but turn thee yet again , and thou shalt see greater abominations .
and he brought me to the door of the court ; and when i looked , behold a hole in the wall .
then came to jesus scribes and pharisees , which were of jerusalem , saying ,
and , behold , the glory of the god of israel was there , according to the vision that i saw in the plain .
why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders ? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread .
then said he unto me , son of man , lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north . so i lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north , and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry .
but he answered and said unto them , why do ye also transgress the commandment of god by your tradition ?
rebuke the company of spearmen , the multitude of the bulls , with the calves of the people , till every one submit himself with pieces of silver : scatter thou the people that delight in war .
sing unto god , ye kingdoms of the earth ; o sing praises unto the lord ; selah :
then said he unto me , son of man , dig now in the wall : and when i had digged in the wall , behold a door .
princes shall come out of egypt ; ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto god .
this people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth , and honoureth me with their lips ; but their heart is far from me .
but in vain they do worship me , teaching for doctrines the commandments of men .
to him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens , which were of old ; lo , he doth send out his voice , and that a mighty voice .
ascribe ye strength unto god : his excellency is over israel , and his strength is in the clouds .
o god , thou art terrible out of thy holy places : the god of israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people . blessed be god .
but god shall wound the head of his enemies , and the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses .
he that is our god is the god of salvation ; and unto god the lord belong the issues from death .
thy god hath commanded thy strength : strengthen , o god , that which thou hast wrought for us .
because of thy temple at jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto thee .
bless ye god in the congregations , even the lord , from the fountain of israel .
there is little benjamin with their ruler , the princes of judah and their council , the princes of zebulun , and the princes of naphtali .
they have seen thy goings , o god ; even the goings of my god , my king , in the sanctuary .
the singers went before , the players on instruments followed after ; among them were the damsels playing with timbrels .
the lord said , i will bring again from bashan , i will bring my people again from the depths of the sea :
that thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies , and the tongue of thy dogs in the same .
stay yourselves , and wonder ; cry ye out , and cry : they are drunken , but not with wine ; they stagger , but not with strong drink .
moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust , and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passeth away : yea , it shall be at an instant suddenly .
thou shalt be visited of the lord of hosts with thunder , and with earthquake , and great noise , with storm and tempest , and the flame of devouring fire .
there was a man in the land of uz , whose name was job ; and that man was perfect and upright , and one that feared god , and eschewed evil .
and his sons went and feasted in their houses , every one his day ; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them .
his substance also was seven thousand sheep , and three thousand camels , and five hundred yoke of oxen , and five hundred she asses , and a very great household ; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east .
yet i will distress ariel , and there shall be heaviness and sorrow : and it shall be unto me as ariel .
and there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters .
and i will camp against thee round about , and will lay siege against thee with a mount , and i will raise forts against thee .
then satan answered the lord , and said , doth job fear god for nought ?
and the lord said unto satan , hast thou considered my servant job , that there is none like him in the earth , a perfect and an upright man , one that feareth god , and escheweth evil ?
and the lord said unto satan , whence comest thou ? then satan answered the lord , and said , from going to and fro in the earth , and from walking up and down in it .
now there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord , and satan came also among them .
wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot , speaking evil of you :
thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom , and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations .
who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead .
the lord upholdeth all that fall , and raiseth up all those that be bowed down .
that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men , but to the will of god .
they shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom , and talk of thy power ;
for the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the gentiles , when we walked in lasciviousness , lusts , excess of wine , revellings , banquetings , and abominable idolatries :
the lord is righteous in all his ways , and holy in all his works .
forasmuch then as christ hath suffered for us in the flesh , arm yourselves likewise with the same mind : for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin ;
the lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him , to all that call upon him in truth .
the eyes of all wait upon thee ; and thou givest them their meat in due season .
thou openest thine hand , and satisfiest the desire of every living thing .
and i am sure that the king of egypt will not let you go , no , not by a mighty hand .
and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves : for charity shall cover the multitude of sins .
use hospitality one to another without grudging .
all thy works shall praise thee , o lord ; and thy saints shall bless thee .
for for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead , that they might be judged according to men in the flesh , but live according to god in the spirit .
but the end of all things is at hand : be ye therefore sober , and watch unto prayer .
and i will give this people favour in the sight of the egyptians : and it shall come to pass , that , when ye go , ye shall not go empty :
but every woman shall borrow of her neighbour , and of her that sojourneth in her house , jewels of silver , and jewels of gold , and raiment : and ye shall put them upon your sons , and upon your daughters ; and ye shall spoil the egyptians .
and i will stretch out my hand , and smite egypt with all my wonders which i will do in the midst thereof : and after that he will let you go .
but he passing through the midst of them went his way ,
and he stood over her , and rebuked the fever ; and it left her : and immediately she arose and ministered unto them .
and they were all amazed , and spake among themselves , saying , what a word is this ! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits , and they come out .
and jesus rebuked him , saying , hold thy peace , and come out of him . and when the devil had thrown him in the midst , he came out of him , and hurt him not .
and he arose out of the synagogue , and entered into simon ' s house . and simon ' s wife ' s mother was taken with a great fever ; and they besought him for her .
and the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about .
and they were astonished at his doctrine : for his word was with power .
and came down to capernaum , a city of galilee , and taught them on the sabbath days .
saying , let us alone ; what have we to do with thee , thou jesus of nazareth ? art thou come to destroy us ? i know thee who thou art ; the holy one of god .
and in the synagogue there was a man , which had a spirit of an unclean devil , and cried out with a loud voice ,
and rose up , and thrust him out of the city , and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built , that they might cast him down headlong .
and all they in the synagogue , when they heard these things , were filled with wrath ,
and many lepers were in israel in the time of eliseus the prophet ; and none of them was cleansed , saving naaman the syrian .
but unto none of them was elias sent , save unto sarepta , a city of sidon , unto a woman that was a widow .
but i tell you of a truth , many widows were in israel in the days of elias , when the heaven was shut up three years and six months , when great famine was throughout all the land ;
and he said , verily i say unto you , no prophet is accepted in his own country .
and all bare him witness , and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth . and they said , is not this joseph ' s son ?
and he began to say unto them , this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears .
and he closed the book , and he gave it again to the minister , and sat down . and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him .
the spirit of the lord is upon me , because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor ; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted , to preach deliverance to the captives , and recovering of sight to the blind , to set at liberty them that are bruised ,
and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet esaias . and when he had opened the book , he found the place where it was written ,
to preach the acceptable year of the lord .
so i was great , and increased more than all that were before me in jerusalem : also my wisdom remained with me .
for it is written , he shall give his angels charge over thee , to keep thee :
i made me great works ; i builded me houses ; i planted me vineyards :
and preached , saying , there cometh one mightier than i after me , the latchet of whose shoes i am not worthy to stoop down and unloose .
i sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine , yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom ; and to lay hold on folly , till i might see what was that good for the sons of men , which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life .
i indeed have baptized you with water : but he shall baptize you with the holy ghost .
and jesus answering said unto him , it is said , thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god .
and there went out unto him all the land of judaea , and they of jerusalem , and were all baptized of him in the river of jordan , confessing their sins .
and in their hands they shall bear thee up , lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone .
i said in mine heart , go to now , i will prove thee with mirth , therefore enjoy pleasure : and , behold , this also is vanity .
and john was clothed with camel ' s hair , and with a girdle of a skin about his loins ; and he did eat locusts and wild honey ;
and jesus returned in the power of the spirit into galilee : and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about .
i gathered me also silver and gold , and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces : i gat me men singers and women singers , and the delights of the sons of men , as musical instruments , and that of all sorts .
the voice of one crying in the wilderness , prepare ye the way of the lord , make his paths straight .
and when the devil had ended all the temptation , he departed from him for a season .
john did baptize in the wilderness , and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins .
and he came to nazareth , where he had been brought up : and , as his custom was , he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day , and stood up for to read .
i made me pools of water , to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees :
the beginning of the gospel of jesus christ , the son of god ;
and he taught in their synagogues , being glorified of all .
i made me gardens and orchards , and i planted trees in them of all kind of fruits :
as it is written in the prophets , behold , i send my messenger before thy face , which shall prepare thy way before thee .
i have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people , which walketh in a way that was not good , after their own thoughts ;
a people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face ; that sacrificeth in gardens , and burneth incense upon altars of brick ;
i am sought of them that asked not for me ; i am found of them that sought me not : i said , behold me , behold me , unto a nation that was not called by my name .
thus saith the lord , as the new wine is found in the cluster , and one saith , destroy it not ; for a blessing is in it : so will i do for my servants ' sakes , that i may not destroy them all .
and i will bring forth a seed out of jacob , and out of judah an inheritor of my mountains : and mine elect shall inherit it , and my servants shall dwell there .
behold , it is written before me : i will not keep silence , but will recompense , even recompense into their bosom ,
which remain among the graves , and lodge in the monuments , which eat swine ' s flesh , and broth of abominable things is in their vessels ;
which say , stand by thyself , come not near to me ; for i am holier than thou . these are a smoke in my nose , a fire that burneth all the day .
i will go and return to my place , till they acknowledge their offence , and seek my face : in their affliction they will seek me early .
for i will be unto ephraim as a lion , and as a young lion to the house of judah : i , even i , will tear and go away ; i will take away , and none shall rescue him .
when ephraim saw his sickness , and judah saw his wound , then went ephraim to the assyrian , and sent to king jareb : yet could he not heal you , nor cure you of your wound .
therefore will i be unto ephraim as a moth , and to the house of judah as rottenness .
ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment , because he willingly walked after the commandment .
the princes of judah were like them that remove the bound : therefore i will pour out my wrath upon them like water .
and when the syrians saw that they were smitten before israel , they gathered themselves together .
and when the children of ammon saw that the syrians were fled , then fled they also before abishai , and entered into the city . so joab returned from the children of ammon , and came to jerusalem .
and the levites that are gone away far from me , when israel went astray , which went astray away from me after their idols ; they shall even bear their iniquity .
and hadarezer sent , and brought out the syrians that were beyond the river : and they came to helam ; and shobach the captain of the host of hadarezer went before them .
and when all the kings that were servants to hadarezer saw that they were smitten before israel , they made peace with israel , and served them . so the syrians feared to help the children of ammon any more .
because they ministered unto them before their idols , and caused the house of israel to fall into iniquity ; therefore have i lifted up mine hand against them , saith the lord god , and they shall bear their iniquity .
and the syrians fled before israel ; and david slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the syrians , and forty thousand horsemen , and smote shobach the captain of their host , who died there .
yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary , having charge at the gates of the house , and ministering to the house : they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people , and they shall stand before them to minister unto them .
but i will make them keepers of the charge of the house , for all the service thereof , and for all that shall be done therein .
they shall enter into my sanctuary , and they shall come near to my table , to minister unto me , and they shall keep my charge .
but the priests the levites , the sons of zadok , that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of israel went astray from me , they shall come near to me to minister unto me , and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood , saith the lord god :
they shall have linen bonnets upon their heads , and shall have linen breeches upon their loins ; they shall not gird themselves with any thing that causeth sweat .
and it shall come to pass , that when they enter in at the gates of the inner court , they shall be clothed with linen garments ; and no wool shall come upon them , whiles they minister in the gates of the inner court , and within .
and he said , if the syrians be too strong for me , then thou shalt help me : but if the children of ammon be too strong for thee , then i will come and help thee .
and the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of abishai his brother , that he might put them in array against the children of ammon .
and when they go forth into the utter court , even into the utter court to the people , they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered , and lay them in the holy chambers , and they shall put on other garments ; and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments .
and joab drew nigh , and the people that were with him , unto the battle against the syrians : and they fled before him .
be of good courage , and let us play the men for our people , and for the cities of our god : and the lord do that which seemeth him good .
and it came to pass in those days , that jesus came from nazareth of galilee , and was baptized of john in jordan .
neither shall any priest drink wine , when they enter into the inner court .
neither shall they shave their heads , nor suffer their locks to grow long ; they shall only poll their heads .
and they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves : but for father , or for mother , or for son , or for daughter , for brother , or for sister that hath had no husband , they may defile themselves .
and in controversy they shall stand in judgment ; and they shall judge it according to my judgments : and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all mine assemblies ; and they shall hallow my sabbaths .
and they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and profane , and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean .
they shall eat the meat offering , and the sin offering , and the trespass offering ; and every dedicated thing in israel shall be theirs .
and it shall be unto them for an inheritance : i am their inheritance : and ye shall give them no possession in israel : i am their possession .
and in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary , unto the inner court , to minister in the sanctuary , he shall offer his sin offering , saith the lord god .
and after he is cleansed , they shall reckon unto him seven days .
then moab rebelled against israel after the death of ahab .
and ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in samaria , and was sick : and he sent messengers , and said unto them , go , inquire of baal - zebub the god of ekron whether i shall recover of this disease .
and when the messengers turned back unto him , he said unto them , why are ye now turned back ?
but the angel of the lord said to elijah the tishbite , arise , go up to meet the messengers of the king of samaria , and say unto them , is it not because there is not a god in israel , that ye go to inquire of baal - zebub the god of ekron ?
now therefore thus saith the lord , thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up , but shalt surely die . and elijah departed .
shall not the day of the lord be darkness , and not light ? even very dark , and no brightness in it ?
i hate , i despise your feast days , and i will not smell in your solemn assemblies .
take thou away from me the noise of thy songs ; for i will not hear the melody of thy viols .
though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings , i will not accept them : neither will i regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts .
have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years , o house of israel ?
but let judgment run down as waters , and righteousness as a mighty stream .
and the first of all the firstfruits of all things , and every oblation of all , of every sort of your oblations , shall be the priest ' s : ye shall also give unto the priest the first of your dough , that he may cause the blessing to rest in thine house .
therefore will i cause you to go into captivity beyond damascus , saith the lord , whose name is the god of hosts .
but ye have borne the tabernacle of your moloch and chiun your images , the star of your god , which ye made to yourselves .
the priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of itself , or torn , whether it be fowl or beast .
then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty . and he went up to him : and , behold , he sat on the top of an hill . and he spake unto him , thou man of god , the king hath said , come down .
and they answered him , he was an hairy man , and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins . and he said , it is elijah the tishbite .
and he said unto them , what manner of man was he which came up to meet you , and told you these words ?
and thou shalt set them in two rows , six on a row , upon the pure table before the lord .
and thou shalt take fine flour , and bake twelve cakes thereof : two tenth deals shall be in one cake .
he shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the lord continually .
without the vail of the testimony , in the tabernacle of the congregation , shall aaron order it from the evening unto the morning before the lord continually : it shall be a statute for ever in your generations .
command the children of israel , that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the light , to cause the lamps to burn continually .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
and it shall be aaron ' s and his sons ' ; and they shall eat it in the holy place : for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the lord made by fire by a perpetual statute .
every sabbath he shall set it in order before the lord continually , being taken from the children of israel by an everlasting covenant .
and thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row , that it may be on the bread for a memorial , even an offering made by fire unto the lord .
now it came to pass in the seventh month , that ishmael the son of nethaniah the son of elishama , of the seed royal , and the princes of the king , even ten men with him , came unto gedaliah the son of ahikam to mizpah ; and there they did eat bread together in mizpah .
and it came to pass the second day after he had slain gedaliah , and no man knew it ,
that there came certain from shechem , from shiloh , and from samaria , even fourscore men , having their beards shaven , and their clothes rent , and having cut themselves , with offerings and incense in their hand , to bring them to the house of the lord .
then arose ishmael the son of nethaniah , and the ten men that were with him , and smote gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan with the sword , and slew him , whom the king of babylon had made governor over the land .
ishmael also slew all the jews that were with him , even with gedaliah , at mizpah , and the chaldeans that were found there , and the men of war .
but ten men were found among them that said unto ishmael , slay us not : for we have treasures in the field , of wheat , and of barley , and of oil , and of honey . so he forbare , and slew them not among their brethren .
now the pit wherein ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men , whom he had slain because of gedaliah , was it which asa the king had made for fear of baasha king of israel : and ishmael the son of nethaniah filled it with them that were slain .
and ishmael the son of nethaniah went forth from mizpah to meet them , weeping all along as he went : and it came to pass , as he met them , he said unto them , come to gedaliah the son of ahikam .
and it was so , when they came into the midst of the city , that ishmael the son of nethaniah slew them , and cast them into the midst of the pit , he , and the men that were with him .
and he said unto me , to build it an house in the land of shinar : and it shall be established , and set there upon her own base .
then said i to the angel that talked with me , whither do these bear the ephah ?
thou hast brought a vine out of egypt : thou hast cast out the heathen , and planted it .
thou preparedst room before it , and didst cause it to take deep root , and it filled the land .
thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours : and our enemies laugh among themselves .
turn us again , o god of hosts , and cause thy face to shine ; and we shall be saved .
o lord god of hosts , how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people ?
thou feedest them with the bread of tears ; and givest them tears to drink in great measure .
before ephraim and benjamin and manasseh stir up thy strength , and come and save us .
turn us again , o god , and cause thy face to shine ; and we shall be saved .
give ear , o shepherd of israel , thou that leadest joseph like a flock ; thou that dwellest between the cherubims , shine forth .
even of late my people is risen up as an enemy : ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war .
when thou dost lend thy brother any thing , thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge .
o thou that art named the house of jacob , is the spirit of the lord straitened ? are these his doings ? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly ?
thou shalt stand abroad , and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring out the pledge abroad unto thee .
and if the man be poor , thou shalt not sleep with his pledge :
the women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses ; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever .
in any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth down , that he may sleep in his own raiment , and bless thee : and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the lord thy god .
in that day shall one take up a parable against you , and lament with a doleful lamentation , and say , we be utterly spoiled : he hath changed the portion of my people : how hath he removed it from me ! turning away he hath divided our fields .
thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy , whether he be of thy brethren , or of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy gates :
therefore thus saith the lord ; behold , against this family do i devise an evil , from which ye shall not remove your necks ; neither shall ye go haughtily : for this time is evil .
at his day thou shalt give him his hire , neither shall the sun go down upon it ; for he is poor , and setteth his heart upon it : lest he cry against thee unto the lord , and it be sin unto thee .
prophesy ye not , say they to them that prophesy : they shall not prophesy to them , that they shall not take shame .
the fathers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin .
therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the lord .
thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger , nor of the fatherless ; nor take a widow ' s raiment to pledge :
but thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in egypt , and the lord thy god redeemed thee thence : therefore i command thee to do this thing .
when thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field , and hast forgot a sheaf in the field , thou shalt not go again to fetch it : it shall be for the stranger , for the fatherless , and for the widow : that the lord thy god may bless thee in all the work of thine hands .
and they covet fields , and take them by violence ; and houses , and take them away : so they oppress a man and his house , even a man and his heritage .
woe to them that devise iniquity , and work evil upon their beds ! when the morning is light , they practise it , because it is in the power of their hand .
remember what the lord thy god did unto miriam by the way , after that ye were come forth out of egypt .
take heed in the plague of leprosy , that thou observe diligently , and do according to all that the priests the levites shall teach you : as i commanded them , so ye shall observe to do .
if a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of israel , and maketh merchandise of him , or selleth him ; then that thief shall die ; and thou shalt put evil away from among you .
no man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge : for he taketh a man ' s life to pledge .
and thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of egypt : therefore i command thee to do this thing .
when thou beatest thine olive tree , thou shalt not go over the boughs again : it shall be for the stranger , for the fatherless , and for the widow .
when thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard , thou shalt not glean it afterward : it shall be for the stranger , for the fatherless , and for the widow .
her former husband , which sent her away , may not take her again to be his wife , after that she is defiled ; for that is abomination before the lord : and thou shalt not cause the land to sin , which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance .
when a man hath taken a new wife , he shall not go out to war , neither shall he be charged with any business : but he shall be free at home one year , and shall cheer up his wife which he hath taken .
and when she is departed out of his house , she may go and be another man ' s wife .
and if the latter husband hate her , and write her a bill of divorcement , and giveth it in her hand , and sendeth her out of his house ; or if the latter husband die , which took her to be his wife ;
hear , o lord , and have mercy upon me : lord , be thou my helper .
when a man hath taken a wife , and married her , and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes , because he hath found some uncleanness in her : then let him write her a bill of divorcement , and give it in her hand , and send her out of his house .
thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing : thou hast put off my sackcloth , and girded me with gladness ;
to the end that my glory may sing praise to thee , and not be silent . o lord my god , i will give thanks unto thee for ever .
and when it was day , he departed and went into a desert place : and the people sought him , and came unto him , and stayed him , that he should not depart from them .
and he said unto them , i must preach the kingdom of god to other cities also : for therefore am i sent .
and he preached in the synagogues of galilee .
so mordecai went his way , and did according to all that esther had commanded him .
for if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time , then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the jews from another place ; but thou and thy father ' s house shall be destroyed : and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this ?
then esther bade them return mordecai this answer ,
again esther spake unto hatach , and gave him commandment unto mordecai ;
and they told to mordecai esther ' s words .
and devils also came out of many , crying out , and saying , thou art christ the son of god . and he rebuking them suffered them not to speak : for they knew that he was christ .
now when the sun was setting , all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him ; and he laid his hands on every one of them , and healed them .
let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things .
be not deceived ; god is not mocked : for whatsoever a man soweth , that shall he also reap .
but let every man prove his own work , and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone , and not in another .
for every man shall bear his own burden .
bear ye one another ' s burdens , and so fulfil the law of christ .
for if a man think himself to be something , when he is nothing , he deceiveth himself .
brethren , if a man be overtaken in a fault , ye which are spiritual , restore such an one in the spirit of meekness ; considering thyself , lest thou also be tempted .
for he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption ; but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life everlasting .
and let us not be weary in well doing : for in due season we shall reap , if we faint not .
the which jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of judah , and to all the inhabitants of jerusalem , saying ,
from the thirteenth year of josiah the son of amon king of judah , even unto this day , that is the three and twentieth year , the word of the lord hath come unto me , and i have spoken unto you , rising early and speaking ; but ye have not hearkened .
the word that came to jeremiah concerning all the people of judah in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah , that was the first year of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon ;
and go not after other gods to serve them , and to worship them , and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands ; and i will do you no hurt .
yet ye have not hearkened unto me , saith the lord ; that ye might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt .
and the lord hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets , rising early and sending them ; but ye have not hearkened , nor inclined your ear to hear .
they said , turn ye again now every one from his evil way , and from the evil of your doings , and dwell in the land that the lord hath given unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever :
therefore thus saith the lord of hosts ; because ye have not heard my words ,
so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god .
but ye are not in the flesh , but in the spirit , if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you . now if any man have not the spirit of christ , he is none of his .
for to be carnally minded is death ; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace .
because the carnal mind is enmity against god : for it is not subject to the law of god , neither indeed can be .
that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us , who walk not after the flesh , but after the spirit .
for from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name shall be great among the gentiles ; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name , and a pure offering : for my name shall be great among the heathen , saith the lord of hosts .
for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh ; but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit .
who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought ? neither do ye kindle fire on mine altar for nought . i have no pleasure in you , saith the lord of hosts , neither will i accept an offering at your hand .
for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death .
there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus , who walk not after the flesh , but after the spirit .
let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed : let them return and be ashamed suddenly .
and edom said unto him , thou shalt not pass by me , lest i come out against thee with the sword .
and when we cried unto the lord , he heard our voice , and sent an angel , and hath brought us forth out of egypt : and , behold , we are in kadesh , a city in the uttermost of thy border :
how our fathers went down into egypt , and we have dwelt in egypt a long time ; and the egyptians vexed us , and our fathers :
and the children of israel said unto him , we will go by the high way : and if i and my cattle drink of thy water , then i will pay for it : i will only , without doing any thing else , go through on my feet .
i removed his shoulder from the burden : his hands were delivered from the pots .
this he ordained in joseph for a testimony , when he went out through the land of egypt : where i heard a language that i understood not .
hear , o my people , and i will testify unto thee : o israel , if thou wilt hearken unto me ;
thou calledst in trouble , and i delivered thee ; i answered thee in the secret place of thunder : i proved thee at the waters of meribah . selah .
take a psalm , and bring hither the timbrel , the pleasant harp with the psaltery .
sing aloud unto god our strength : make a joyful noise unto the god of jacob .
for this was a statute for israel , and a law of the god of jacob .
blow up the trumpet in the new moon , in the time appointed , on our solemn feast day .
now the rest of the acts of amaziah , first and last , behold , are they not written in the book of the kings of judah and israel ?
now after the time that amaziah did turn away from following the lord they made a conspiracy against him in jerusalem ; and he fled to lachish : but they sent to lachish after him , and slew him there .
and all the cities of sihon king of the amorites , which reigned in heshbon , unto the border of the children of ammon ;
and they brought him upon horses , and buried him with his fathers in the city of judah .
and judah was put to the worse before israel , and they fled every man to his tent .
and joash the king of israel took amaziah king of judah , the son of joash , the son of jehoahaz , at beth - shemesh , and brought him to jerusalem , and brake down the wall of jerusalem from the gate of ephraim to the corner gate , four hundred cubits .
and he took all the gold and the silver , and all the vessels that were found in the house of god with obed - edom , and the treasures of the king ' s house , the hostages also , and returned to samaria .
and amaziah the son of joash king of judah lived after the death of joash son of jehoahaz king of israel fifteen years .
and he said , thou shalt not go through . and edom came out against him with much people , and with a strong hand .
thus edom refused to give israel passage through his border : wherefore israel turned away from him .
but amaziah would not hear ; for it came of god , that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies , because they sought after the gods of edom .
so joash the king of israel went up ; and they saw one another in the face , both he and amaziah king of judah , at beth - shemesh , which belongeth to judah .
aaron shall be gathered unto his people : for he shall not enter into the land which i have given unto the children of israel , because ye rebelled against my word at the water of meribah .
take aaron and eleazar his son , and bring them up unto mount hor :
and the children of israel , even the whole congregation , journeyed from kadesh , and came unto mount hor .
and the lord spake unto moses and aaron in mount hor , by the coast of the land of edom , saying ,
and moses did as the lord commanded : and they went up into mount hor in the sight of all the congregation .
and strip aaron of his garments , and put them upon eleazar his son : and aaron shall be gathered unto his people , and shall die there .
and when all the congregation saw that aaron was dead , they mourned for aaron thirty days , even all the house of israel .
and moses stripped aaron of his garments , and put them upon eleazar his son ; and aaron died there in the top of the mount : and moses and eleazar came down from the mount .
and kirjathaim , and sibmah , and zareth - shahar in the mount of the valley ,
and their coast was from aroer , that is on the bank of the river arnon , and the city that is in the midst of the river , and all the plain by medeba ;
and moses gave unto the tribe of the children of reuben inheritance according to their families .
heshbon , and all her cities that are in the plain ; dibon , and bamoth - baal , and beth - baal - meon ,
all the kingdom of og in bashan , which reigned in ashtaroth and in edrei , who remained of the remnant of the giants : for these did moses smite , and cast them out .
and gilead , and the border of the geshurites and maachathites , and all mount hermon , and all bashan unto salcah ;
only unto the tribe of levi he gave none inheritance ; the sacrifices of the lord god of israel made by fire are their inheritance , as he said unto them .
thou sayest , lo , thou hast smitten the edomites ; and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast : abide now at home ; why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt , that thou shouldest fall , even thou , and judah with thee ?
nevertheless the children of israel expelled not the geshurites , nor the maachathites : but the geshurites and the maachathites dwell among the israelites until this day .
then amaziah king of judah took advice , and sent to joash , the son of jehoahaz , the son of jehu , king of israel , saying , come , let us see one another in the face .
but jehoshaphat said , is there not here a prophet of the lord , that we may inquire of the lord by him ? and one of the king of israel ' s servants answered and said , here is elisha the son of shaphat , which poured water on the hands of elijah .
and joash king of israel sent to amaziah king of judah , saying , the thistle that was in lebanon sent to the cedar that was in lebanon , saying , give thy daughter to my son to wife : and there passed by a wild beast that was in lebanon , and trode down the thistle .
and the king of israel said , alas ! that the lord hath called these three kings together , to deliver them into the hand of moab !
wherefore the anger of the lord was kindled against amaziah , and he sent unto him a prophet , which said unto him , why hast thou sought after the gods of the people , which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand ?
and beth - peor , and ashdoth - pisgah , and beth - jeshimoth ,
and jehoshaphat said , the word of the lord is with him . so the king of israel and jehoshaphat and the king of edom went down to him .
and all the cities of the plain , and all the kingdom of sihon king of the amorites , which reigned in heshbon , whom moses smote with the princes of midian , evi , and rekem , and zur , and hur , and reba , which were dukes of sihon , dwelling in the country .
but the soldiers of the army which amaziah sent back , that they should not go with him to battle , fell upon the cities of judah , from samaria even unto beth - horon , and smote three thousand of them , and took much spoil .
now it came to pass , after that amaziah was come from the slaughter of the edomites , that he brought the gods of the children of seir , and set them up to be his gods , and bowed down himself before them , and burned incense unto them .
and amaziah strengthened himself , and led forth his people , and went to the valley of salt , and smote of the chidren of seir ten thousand .
there shall no strange god be in thee ; neither shalt thou worship any strange god .
and other ten thousand left alive did the children of judah carry away captive , and brought them unto the top of the rock , and cast them down from the top of the rock , that they all were broken in pieces .
and ye shall smite every fenced city , and every choice city , and shall fell every good tree , and stop all wells of water , and mar every good piece of land with stones .
and this is but a light thing in the sight of the lord : he will deliver the moabites also into your hand .
but now bring me a minstrel . and it came to pass , when the minstrel played , that the hand of the lord came upon him .
and elisha said , as the lord of hosts liveth , before whom i stand , surely , were it not that i regard the presence of jehoshaphat the king of judah , i would not look toward thee , nor see thee .
for thus saith the lord , ye shall not see wind , neither shall ye see rain ; yet that valley shall be filled with water , that ye may drink , both ye , and your cattle , and your beasts .
and he said , thus saith the lord , make this valley full of ditches .
so that they shall take no wood out of the field , neither cut down any out of the forests ; for they shall burn the weapons with fire : and they shall spoil those that spoiled them , and rob those that robbed them , saith the lord god .
and seven months shall the house of israel be burying of them , that they may cleanse the land .
and their coast was jazer , and all the cities of gilead , and half the land of the children of ammon , unto aroer that is before rabbah ;
and moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of gad , even unto the children of gad according to their families .
and the border of the children of reuben was jordan , and the border thereof . this was the inheritance of the children of reuben after their families , the cities and the villages thereof .
balaam also the son of beor , the soothsayer , did the children of israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them .
and moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of manasseh : and this was the possession of the half tribe of the children of manasseh by their families .
this is the inheritance of the children of gad after their families , the cities , and their villages .
and in the valley , beth - aram , and beth - nimrah , and succoth , and zaphon , the rest of the kingdom of sihon king of heshbon , jordan and his border , even unto the edge of the sea of chinnereth on the other side jordan eastward .
and from heshbon unto ramath - mizpeh , and betonim ; and from mahanaim unto the border of debir ;
and half gilead , and ashtaroth , and edrei , cities of the kingdom of og in bashan , were pertaining unto the children of machir the son of manasseh , even to the one half of the children of machir by their families .
these are the countries which moses did distribute for inheritance in the plains of moab , on the other side jordan , by jericho , eastward .
and their coast was from mahanaim , all bashan , all the kingdom of og king of bashan , and all the towns of jair , which are in bashan , threescore cities :
so the house of israel shall know that i am the lord their god from that day and forward .
and the heathen shall know that the house of israel went into captivity for their iniquity : because they trespassed against me , therefore hid i my face from them , and gave them into the hand of their enemies : so fell they all by the sword .
thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots , with mighty men , and with all men of war , saith the lord god .
and i will set my glory among the heathen , and all the heathen shall see my judgment that i have executed , and my hand that i have laid upon them .
but unto the tribe of levi moses gave not any inheritance : the lord god of israel was their inheritance , as he said unto them .
and moses lifted up his hand , and with his rod he smote the rock twice : and the water came out abundantly , and the congregation drank , and their beasts also .
and also the name of the city shall be hamonah . thus shall they cleanse the land .
and the lord spake unto moses and aaron , because ye believed me not , to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of israel , therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which i have given them .
and the passengers that pass through the land , when any seeth a man ' s bone , then shall he set up a sign by it , till the buriers have buried it in the valley of hamon - gog .
this is the water of meribah ; because the children of israel strove with the lord , and he was sanctified in them .
and they shall sever out men of continual employment , passing through the land to bury with the passengers those that remain upon the face of the earth , to cleanse it : after the end of seven months shall they search .
and moses sent messengers from kadesh unto the king of edom , thus saith thy brother israel , thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us :
yea , all the people of the land shall bury them ; and it shall be to them a renown the day that i shall be glorified , saith the lord god .
and ye shall eat fat till ye be full , and drink blood till ye be drunken , of my sacrifice which i have sacrificed for you .
ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty , and drink the blood of the princes of the earth , of rams , of lambs , and of goats , of bullocks , all of them fatlings of bashan .
and moses and aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock , and he said unto them , hear now , ye rebels ; must we fetch you water out of this rock ?
then shall they know that i am the lord their god , which cause them to be led into captivity among the heathen : but i have gathered them unto their own land , and have left none of them any more there .
neither will i hide my face any more from them : for i have poured out my spirit upon the house of israel , saith the lord god .
after that they have borne their shame , and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me , when they dwelt safely in their land , and none made them afraid .
according to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions have i done unto them , and hid my face from them .
therefore thus saith the lord god ; now will i bring again the captivity of jacob , and have mercy upon the whole house of israel , and will be jealous for my holy name ;
wherefore glorify ye the lord in the fires , even the name of the lord god of israel in the isles of the sea .
they shall lift up their voice , they shall sing for the majesty of the lord , they shall cry aloud from the sea .
fear , and the pit , and the snare , are upon thee , o inhabitant of the earth .
there is a crying for wine in the streets ; all joy is darkened , the mirth of the land is gone .
the city of confusion is broken down : every house is shut up , that no man may come in .
when thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people , there shall be as the shaking of an olive tree , and as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done .
in the city is left desolation , and the gate is smitten with destruction .
binding his foal unto the vine , and his ass ' s colt unto the choice vine ; he washed his garments in wine , and his clothes in the blood of grapes :
the sceptre shall not depart from judah , nor a lawgiver from between his feet , until shiloh come ; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be .
and it shall come to pass , that he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit ; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare : for the windows from on high are open , and the foundations of the earth do shake .
the earth is utterly broken down , the earth is clean dissolved , the earth is moved exceedingly .
rejoice greatly , o daughter of zion ; shout , o daughter of jerusalem : behold , thy king cometh unto thee : he is just , and having salvation ; lowly , and riding upon an ass , and upon a colt the foal of an ass .
and i will encamp about mine house because of the army , because of him that passeth by , and because of him that returneth : and no oppressor shall pass through them any more : for now have i seen with mine eyes .
and i will take away his blood out of his mouth , and his abominations from between his teeth : but he that remaineth , even he , shall be for our god , and he shall be as a governor in judah , and ekron as a jebusite .
dan shall judge his people , as one of the tribes of israel .
dan shall be a serpent by the way , an adder in the path , that biteth the horse heels , so that his rider shall fall backward .
i have waited for thy salvation , o lord .
gad , a troop shall overcome him : but he shall overcome at the last .
his eyes shall be red with wine , and his teeth white with milk .
zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea ; and he shall be for an haven of ships ; and his border shall be unto zidon .
issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens :
and he saw that rest was good , and the land that it was pleasant ; and bowed his shoulder to bear , and became a servant unto tribute .
out of asher his bread shall be fat , and he shall yield royal dainties .
joseph is a fruitful bough , even a fruitful bough by a well ; whose branches run over the wall :
naphtali is a hind let loose : he giveth goodly words .
their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven , and broughtest them into the land , concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers , that they should go in to possess it .
moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations , and didst divide them into corners : so they possessed the land of sihon , and the land of the king of heshbon , and the land of og king of bashan .
yea , forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness , so that they lacked nothing ; their clothes waxed not old , and their feet swelled not .
thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them , and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth , and gavest them water for their thirst .
then said i unto them , cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes , and defile not yourselves with the idols of egypt : i am the lord your god .
in the day that i lifted up mine hand unto them , to bring them forth of the land of egypt into a land that i had espied for them , flowing with milk and honey , which is the glory of all lands :
but i wrought for my name ' s sake , that it should not be polluted before the heathen , among whom they were , in whose sight i made myself known unto them , in bringing them forth out of the land of egypt .
yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness : the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day , to lead them in the way ; neither the pillar of fire by night , to shew them light , and the way wherein they should go .
then came the word of the lord unto me , saying ,
son of man , speak unto the elders of israel , and say unto them , thus saith the lord god ; are ye come to inquire of me ? as i live , saith the lord god , i will not be inquired of by you .
wilt thou judge them , son of man , wilt thou judge them ? cause them to know the abominations of their fathers :
yea , when they had made them a molten calf , and said , this is thy god that brought thee up out of egypt , and had wrought great provocations ;
and gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger , and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst , and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them .
but they and our fathers dealt proudly , and hardened their necks , and hearkened not to thy commandments ,
thou camest down also upon mount sinai , and spakest with them from heaven , and gavest them right judgments , and true laws , good statutes and commandments :
and it came to pass in the seventh year , in the fifth month , the tenth day of the month , that certain of the elders of israel came to inquire of the lord , and sat before me .
while they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear .
and tyrus did build herself a strong hold , and heaped up silver as the dust , and fine gold as the mire of the streets .
likewise , ye wives , be in subjection to your own husbands ; that , if any obey not the word , they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives ;
behold , the lord will cast her out , and he will smite her power in the sea ; and she shall be devoured with fire .
in this the children of god are manifest , and the children of the devil : whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of god , neither he that loveth not his brother .
ashkelon shall see it , and fear ; gaza also shall see it , and be very sorrowful , and ekron ; for her expectation shall be ashamed ; and the king shall perish from gaza , and ashkelon shall not be inhabited .
and a bastard shall dwell in ashdod , and i will cut off the pride of the philistines .
even as sara obeyed abraham , calling him lord : whose daughters ye are , as long as ye do well , and are not afraid with any amazement .
for after this manner in the old time the holy women also , who trusted in god , adorned themselves , being in subjection unto their own husbands :
but let it be the hidden man of the heart , in that which is not corruptible , even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit , which is in the sight of god of great price .
the burden of the word of the lord in the land of hadrach , and damascus shall be the rest thereof : when the eyes of man , as of all the tribes of israel , shall be toward the lord .
whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair , and of wearing of gold , or of putting on of apparel ;
and hamath also shall border thereby ; tyrus , and zidon , though it be very wise .
and shewedst signs and wonders upon pharoah , and on all his servants , and on all the people of his land : for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them . so didst thou get thee a name , as it is this day .
not rendering evil for evil , or railing for railing : but contrariwise blessing ; knowing that ye are thereunto called , that ye should inherit a blessing .
finally , be ye all of one mind , having compassion one of another , love as brethren , be pitiful , be courteous :
moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar ; and in the night by a pillar of fire , to give them light in the way wherein they should go .
likewise , ye husbands , dwell with them according to knowledge , giving honour unto the wife , as unto the weaker vessel , and as being heirs together of the grace of life ; that your prayers be not hindered .
and thou didst divide the sea before them , so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land ; and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps , as a stone into the mighty waters .
and they reasoned among themselves , saying , it is because we have taken no bread .
which when jesus perceived , he said unto them , o ye of little faith , why reason ye among yourselves , because ye have brought no bread ?
do ye not yet understand , neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand , and how many baskets ye took up ?
and mine eye shall not spare , neither will i have pity : i will recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations that are in the midst of thee ; and ye shall know that i am the lord that smiteth .
the morning is come unto thee , o thou that dwellest in the land : the time is come , the day of trouble is near , and not the sounding again of the mountains .
now will i shortly pour out my fury upon thee , and accomplish mine anger upon thee : and i will judge thee according to thy ways , and will recompense thee for all thine abominations .
thus saith the lord god ; an evil , an only evil , behold , is come .
the pharisees also with the sadducees came , and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven .
an end is come , the end is come : it watcheth for thee ; behold , it is come .
he answered and said unto them , when it is evening , ye say , it will be fair weather : for the sky is red .
and whatsoever we ask , we receive of him , because we keep his commandments , and do those things that are pleasing in his sight .
now is the end come upon thee , and i will send mine anger upon thee , and will judge thee according to thy ways , and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations .
and in the morning , it will be foul weather to day : for the sky is red and lowring . o ye hypocrites , ye can discern the face of the sky ; but can ye not discern the signs of the times ?
beloved , if our heart condemn us not , then have we confidence toward god .
and mine eye shall not spare thee , neither will i have pity : but i will recompense thy ways upon thee , and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee : and ye shall know that i am the lord .
a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign ; and there shall no sign be given unto it , but the sign of the prophet jonas . and he left them , and departed .
for if our heart condemn us , god is greater than our heart , and knoweth all things .
moreover the word of the lord came unto me , saying ,
and when his disciples were come to the other side , they had forgotten to take bread .
also , thou son of man , thus saith the lord god unto the land of israel ; an end , the end is come upon the four corners of the land .
then jesus said unto them , take heed and beware of the leaven of the pharisees and of the sadducees .
we know that we have passed from death unto life , because we love the brethren . he that loveth not his brother abideth in death .
who hath heard such a thing ? who hath seen such things ? shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day ? or shall a nation be born at once ? for as soon as zion travailed , she brought forth her children .
whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer : and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him .
before she travailed , she brought forth ; before her pain came , she was delivered of a man child .
not as cain , who was of that wicked one , and slew his brother . and wherefore slew he him ? because his own works were evil , and his brother ' s righteous .
marvel not , my brethren , if the world hate you .
shall i bring to the birth , and not cause to bring forth ? saith the lord : shall i cause to bring forth , and shut the womb ? saith thy god .
my little children , let us not love in word , neither in tongue ; but in deed and in truth .
i also will choose their delusions , and will bring their fears upon them ; because when i called , none did answer ; when i spake , they did not hear : but they did evil before mine eyes , and chose that in which i delighted not .
and hereby we know that we are of the truth , and shall assure our hearts before him .
hereby perceive we the love of god , because he laid down his life for us : and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren .
a voice of noise from the city , a voice from the temple , a voice of the lord that rendereth recompence to his enemies .
but whoso hath this world ' s good , and seeth his brother have need , and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him , how dwelleth the love of god in him ?
hear the word of the lord , ye that tremble at his word ; your brethren that hated you , that cast you out for my name ' s sake , said , let the lord be glorified : but he shall appear to your joy , and they shall be ashamed .
and because of all this we make a sure covenant , and write it ; and our princes , levites , and priests , seal unto it .
and it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins : also they have dominion over our bodies , and over our cattle , at their pleasure , and we are in great distress .
behold , we are servants this day , and for the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof , behold , we are servants in it :
for all those things hath mine hand made , and those things have been , saith the lord : but to this man will i look , even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit , and trembleth at my word .
for they have not served thee in their kingdom , and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them , and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them , neither turned they from their wicked works .
thus saith the lord , the heaven is my throne , and the earth is my footstool : where is the house that ye build unto me ? and where is the place of my rest ?
yet many years didst thou forbear them , and testifiedst against them by thy spirit in thy prophets : yet would they not give ear : therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands .
nevertheless for thy great mercies ' sake thou didst not utterly consume them , nor forsake them ; for thou art a gracious and merciful god .
howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us ; for thou hast done right , but we have done wickedly :
neither have our kings , our princes , our priests , nor our fathers , kept thy law , nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies , wherewith thou didst testify against them .
and he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him , and he in him . and hereby we know that he abideth in us , by the spirit which he hath given us .
and they took strong cities , and a fat land , and possessed houses full of all goods , wells digged , vineyards , and oliveyards , and fruit trees in abundance : so they did eat , and were filled , and became fat , and delighted themselves in thy great goodness .
so the children went in and possessed the land , and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land , the canaanites , and gavest them into their hands , with their kings , and the people of the land , that they might do with them as they would .
therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies , who vexed them : and in the time of their trouble , when they cried unto thee , thou heardest them from heaven ; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours , who saved them out of the hand of their enemies .
nevertheless they were disobedient , and rebelled against thee , and cast thy law behind their backs , and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee , and they wrought great provocations .
the blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills : they shall be on the head of joseph , and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren .
even by the god of thy father , who shall help thee ; and by the almighty , who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above , blessings of the deep that lieth under , blessings of the breasts , and of the womb :
but his bow abode in strength , and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty god of jacob ; ( from thence is the shepherd , the stone of israel : )
the archers have sorely grieved him , and shot at him , and hated him :
and he charged them , and said unto them , i am to be gathered unto my people : bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of ephron the hittite ,
all these are the twelve tribes of israel : and this is it that their father spake unto them , and blessed them ; every one according to his blessing he blessed them .
benjamin shall ravin as a wolf : in the morning he shall devour the prey , and at night he shall divide the spoil .
and god saw their works , that they turned from their evil way ; and god repented of the evil , that he had said that he would do unto them ; and he did it not .
the purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of heth .
and when jacob had made an end of commanding his sons , he gathered up his feet into the bed , and yielded up the ghost , and was gathered unto his people .
in the cave that is in the field of machpelah , which is before mamre , in the land of canaan , which abraham bought with the field of ephron the hittite for a possession of a buryingplace .
there they buried abraham and sarah his wife ; there they buried isaac and rebekah his wife ; and there i buried leah .
then the moon shall be confounded , and the sun ashamed , when the lord of hosts shall reign in mount zion , and in jerusalem , and before his ancients gloriously .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the lord shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high , and the kings of the earth upon the earth .
and they shall be gathered together , as prisoners are gathered in the pit , and shall be shut up in the prison , and after many days shall they be visited .
the earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard , and shall be removed like a cottage ; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it ; and it shall fall , and not rise again .
who are kept by the power of god through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time .
wherein ye greatly rejoice , though now for a season , if need be , ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations :
that the trial of your faith , being much more precious than of gold that perisheth , though it be tried with fire , might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of jesus christ :
whom having not seen , ye love ; in whom , though now ye see him not , yet believing , ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory :
peter , an apostle of jesus christ , to the strangers scattered throughout pontus , galatia , cappadocia , asia , and bithynia ,
elect according to the foreknowledge of god the father , through sanctification of the spirit , unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ : grace unto you , and peace , be multiplied .
blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ , which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead ,
to an inheritance incorruptible , and undefiled , and that fadeth not away , reserved in heaven for you ,
receiving the end of your faith , even the salvation of your souls .
at that time shall it be said to this people and to jerusalem , a dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people , not to fan , nor to cleanse ,
then said i , ah , lord god ! surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and jerusalem , saying , ye shall have peace ; whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul .
even a full wind from those places shall come unto me : now also will i give sentence against them .
hast thou faith ? have it to thyself before god . happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth .
the whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen ; they shall go into thickets , and climb up upon the rocks : every city shall be forsaken , and not a man dwell therein .
it is good neither to eat flesh , nor to drink wine , nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth , or is offended , or is made weak .
and he that doubteth is damned if he eat , because he eateth not of faith : for whatsoever is not of faith is sin .
i beheld , and , lo , there was no man , and all the birds of the heavens were fled .
i beheld , and , lo , the fruitful place was a wilderness , and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the lord , and by his fierce anger .
for thus hath the lord said , the whole land shall be desolate ; yet will i not make a full end .
for this shall the earth mourn , and the heavens above be black : because i have spoken it , i have purposed it , and will not repent , neither will i turn back from it .
for i have heard a voice as of a woman in travail , and the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child , the voice of the daughter of zion , that bewaileth herself , that spreadeth her hands , saying , woe is me now ! for my soul is wearied because of murderers .
and when thou art spoiled , what wilt thou do ? though thou clothest thyself with crimson , though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold , though thou rentest thy face with painting , in vain shalt thou make thyself fair ; thy lovers will despise thee , they will seek thy life .
let us not therefore judge one another any more : but judge this rather , that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother ' s way .
so then every one of us shall give account of himself to god .
for it is written , as i live , saith the lord , every knee shall bow to me , and every tongue shall confess to god .
thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee ; this is thy wickedness , because it is bitter , because it reacheth unto thine heart .
but why dost thou judge thy brother ? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother ? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of christ .
my bowels , my bowels ! i am pained at my very heart ; my heart maketh a noise in me ; i cannot hold my peace , because thou hast heard , o my soul , the sound of the trumpet , the alarm of war .
for the kingdom of god is not meat and drink ; but righteousness , and peace , and joy in the holy ghost .
make ye mention to the nations ; behold , publish against jerusalem , that watchers come from a far country , and give out their voice against the cities of judah .
let not then your good be evil spoken of :
as keepers of a field , are they against her round about ; because she hath been rebellious against me , saith the lord .
but if thy brother be grieved with thy meat , now walkest thou not charitably . destroy not him with thy meat , for whom christ died .
o jerusalem , wash thine heart from wickedness , that thou mayest be saved . how long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee ?
i know , and am persuaded by the lord jesus , that there is nothing unclean of itself : but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean , to him it is unclean .
for a voice declareth from dan , and publisheth affliction from mount ephraim .
i beheld the mountains , and , lo , they trembled , and all the hills moved lightly .
i beheld the earth , and , lo , it was without form , and void ; and the heavens , and they had no light .
for my people is foolish , they have not known me ; they are sottish children , and they have none understanding : they are wise to do evil , but to do good they have no knowledge .
how long shall i see the standard , and hear the sound of the trumpet ?
destruction upon destruction is cried ; for the whole land is spoiled : suddenly are my tents spoiled , and my curtains in a moment .
for meat destroy not the work of god . all things indeed are pure ; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence .
ye have heard that it was said by them of old time , thou shalt not kill ; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment :
and it came to pass , when moses held up his hand , that israel prevailed : and when he let down his hand , amalek prevailed .
but i say unto you , that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment : and whosoever shall say to his brother , raca , shall be in danger of the council : but whosoever shall say , thou fool , shall be in danger of hell fire .
so joshua did as moses had said to him , and fought with amalek : and moses , aaron , and hur went up to the top of the hill .
for i say unto you , that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees , ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven .
for he said , because the lord hath sworn that the lord will have war with amalek from generation to generation .
agree with thine adversary quickly , whiles thou art in the way with him ; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge , and the judge deliver thee to the officer , and thou be cast into prison .
and moses built an altar , and called the name of it jehovah - nissi :
verily i say unto thee , thou shalt by no means come out thence , till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing .
and the lord said unto moses , write this for a memorial in a book , and rehearse it in the ears of joshua : for i will utterly put out the remembrance of amalek from under heaven .
therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar , and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee ;
and joshua discomfited amalek and his people with the edge of the sword .
leave there thy gift before the altar , and go thy way ; first be reconciled to thy brother , and then come and offer thy gift .
and if thy right eye offend thee , pluck it out , and cast it from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish , and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell .
ye have heard that it was said by them of old time , thou shalt not commit adultery :
but i say unto you , that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart .
and see , and , behold , if the daughters of shiloh come out to dance in dances , then come ye out of the vineyards , and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of shiloh , and go to the land of benjamin .
therefore they commanded the children of benjamin , saying , go and lie in wait in the vineyards ;
and the children of benjamin did so , and took them wives , according to their number , of them that danced , whom they caught : and they went and returned unto their inheritance , and repaired the cities , and dwelt in them .
and the children of israel departed thence at that time , every man to his tribe and to his family , and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance .
and if thy right hand offend thee , cut if off , and cast it from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish , and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell .
it hath been said , whosoever shall put away his wife , let him give her a writing of divorcement :
but i say unto you , that whosoever shall put away his wife , saving for the cause of fornication , causeth her to commit adultery : and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery .
again , ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time , thou shalt not forswear thyself , but shalt perform unto the lord thine oaths :
but i say unto you , swear not at all ; neither by heaven ; for it is god ' s throne :
nor by the earth ; for it is his footstool : neither by jerusalem ; for it is the city of the great king .
neither shalt thou swear by thy head , because thou canst not make one hair white or black .
ye have heard that it hath been said , an eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth :
but i say unto you , that ye resist not evil : but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek , turn to him the other also .
then they said , behold , there is a feast of the lord in shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of bethel , on the east side of the highway that goeth up from bethel to shechem , and on the south of lebonah .
howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters : for the children of israel have sworn , saying , cursed be he that giveth a wife to benjamin .
and they said , there must be an inheritance for them that be escaped of benjamin , that a tribe be not destroyed out of israel .
and they found among the inhabitants of jabesh - gilead four hundred young virgins , that had known no man by lying with any male : and they brought them unto the camp to shiloh , which is in the land of canaan .
and this is the thing that ye shall do , ye shall utterly destroy every male , and every woman that hath lain by man .
and the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest , and commanded them , saying , go and smite the inhabitants of jabesh - gilead with the edge of the sword , with the women and the children .
then the elders of the congregation said , how shall we do for wives for them that remain , seeing the women are destroyed out of benjamin ?
and benjamin came again at that time ; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of jabesh - gilead : and yet so they sufficed them not .
and the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of benjamin that were in the rock rimmon , and to call peaceably unto them .
and if ye salute your brethren only , what do ye more than others ? do not even the publicans so ?
be ye therefore perfect , even as your father which is in heaven is perfect .
that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven : for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good , and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust .
for if ye love them which love you , what reward have ye ? do not even the publicans the same ?
ye have heard that it hath been said , thou shalt love thy neighbour , and hate thine enemy .
but i say unto you , love your enemies , bless them that curse you , do good to them that hate you , and pray for them which despitefully use you , and persecute you ;
and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile , go with him twain .
give to him that asketh thee , and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away .
and send them to the king of edom , and to the king of moab , and to the king of the ammonites , and to the king of tyrus , and to the king of zidon , by the hand of the messengers which come to jerusalem unto zedekiah king of judah ;
thus saith the lord to me ; make thee bonds and yokes , and put them upon thy neck ,
i have made the earth , the man and the beast that are upon the ground , by my great power and by my outstretched arm , and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me .
and command them to say unto their masters , thus saith the lord of hosts , the god of israel ; thus shall ye say unto your masters ;
in the beginning of the reign of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah came this word unto jeremiah from the lord , saying ,
and now have i given all these lands unto the hand of nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon , my servant ; and the beasts of the field have i given him also to serve him .
and the lord said unto moses , speak unto the priests the sons of aaron , and say unto them , there shall none be defiled for the dead among his people :
and all nations shall serve him , and his son , and his son ' s son , until the very time of his land come : and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him .
therefore hearken not ye to your prophets , nor to your diviners , nor to your dreamers , nor to your enchanters , nor to your sorcerers , which speak unto you , saying , ye shall not serve the king of babylon :
and if any man will sue thee at the law , and take away thy coat , let him have thy cloke also .
and for his sister a virgin , that is nigh unto him , which hath had no husband ; for her may he be defiled .
but for his kin , that is near unto him , that is , for his mother , and for his father , and for his son , and for his daughter , and for his brother ,
they shall not make baldness upon their head , neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard , nor make any cuttings in their flesh .
but he shall not defile himself , being a chief man among his people , to profane himself .
they shall not take a wife that is a whore , or profane ; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband : for he is holy unto his god .
they shall be holy unto their god , and not profane the name of their god : for the offerings of the lord made by fire , and the bread of their god , they do offer : therefore they shall be holy .
and the daughter of any priest , if she profane herself by playing the whore , she profaneth her father : she shall be burnt with fire .
thou shalt sanctify him therefore ; for he offereth the bread of thy god : he shall be holy unto thee : for i the lord , which sanctify you , am holy .
therefore night shall be unto you , that ye shall not have a vision ; and it shall be dark unto you , that ye shall not divine ; and the sun shall go down over the prophets , and the day shall be dark over them .
then shall the seers be ashamed , and the diviners confounded : yea , they shall all cover their lips ; for there is no answer of god .
but truly i am full of power by the spirit of the lord , and of judgment , and of might , to declare unto jacob his transgression , and to israel his sin .
hear this , i pray you , ye heads of the house of jacob , and princes of the house of israel , that abhor judgment , and pervert all equity .
and i said , hear , i pray you , o heads of jacob , and ye princes of the house of israel ; is it not for you to know judgment ?
who hate the good , and love the evil ; who pluck off their skin from off them , and their flesh from off their bones ;
who also eat the flesh of my people , and flay their skin from off them ; and they break their bones , and chop them in pieces , as for the pot , and as flesh within the caldron .
then shall they cry unto the lord , but he will not hear them : he will even hide his face from them at that time , as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings .
thus saith the lord concerning the prophets that make my people err , that bite with their teeth , and cry , peace ; and he that putteth not into their mouths , they even prepare war against him .
and the anger of the lord was kindled against uzza , and he smote him , because he put his hand to the ark : and there he died before god .
and david was afraid of god that day , saying , how shall i bring the ark of god home to me ?
and david was displeased , because the lord had made a breach upon uzza : wherefore that place is called perez - uzza to this day .
and the ark of god remained with the family of obed - edom in his house three months . and the lord blessed the house of obed - edom , and all that he had .
so david brought not the ark home to himself to the city of david , but carried it aside into the house of obed - edom the gittite .
now there was found in it a poor wise man , and he by his wisdom delivered the city ; yet no man remembered that same poor man .
then said i , wisdom is better than strength : nevertheless the poor man ' s wisdom is despised , and his words are not heard .
this wisdom have i seen also under the sun , and it seemed great unto me :
there was a little city , and few men within it ; and there came a great king against it , and besieged it , and built great bulwarks against it :
i returned , and saw under the sun , that the race is not to the swift , nor the battle to the strong , neither yet bread to the wise , nor yet riches to men of understanding , nor yet favour to men of skill ; but time and chance happeneth to them all .
for man also knoweth not his time : as the fishes that are taken in an evil net , and as the birds that are caught in the snare ; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time , when it falleth suddenly upon them .
whatsoever thy hand findeth to do , do it with thy might ; for there is no work , nor device , nor knowledge , nor wisdom , in the grave , whither thou goest .
but the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king amon ; and the people of the land made josiah his son king in his stead .
and humbled not himself before the lord , as manasseh his father had humbled himself ; but amon trespassed more and more .
and his servants conspired against him , and slew him in his own house .
amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign , and reigned two years in jerusalem .
but he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord , as did manasseh his father : for amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which manasseh his father had made , and served them ;
so manasseh slept with his fathers , and they buried him in his own house : and amon his son reigned in his stead .
who will bring me into the strong city ? who will lead me into edom ?
moab is my washpot ; over edom will i cast out my shoe : philistia , triumph thou because of me .
wisdom is better than weapons of war : but one sinner destroyeth much good .
the words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools .
think not that i am come to destroy the law , or the prophets : i am not come to destroy , but to fulfil .
let your light so shine before men , that they may see your good works , and glorify your father which is in heaven .
whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments , and shall teach men so , he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven : but whosoever shall do and teach them , the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven .
for verily i say unto you , till heaven and earth pass , one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law , till all be fulfilled .
and when he was in affliction , he besought the lord his god , and humbled himself greatly before the god of his fathers ,
thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee , that it may be displayed because of the truth . selah .
ye are the salt of the earth : but if the salt have lost his savour , wherewith shall it be salted ? it is thenceforth good for nothing , but to be cast out , and to be trodden under foot of men .
that thy beloved may be delivered ; save with thy right hand , and hear me .
rejoice , and be exceeding glad : for great is your reward in heaven : for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you .
neither do men light a candle , and put it under a bushel , but on a candlestick ; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house .
and he took away the strange gods , and the idol out of the house of the lord , and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the lord , and in jerusalem , and cast them out of the city .
gilead is mine , and manasseh is mine ; ephraim also is the strength of mine head ; judah is my lawgiver ;
ye are the light of the world . a city that is set on an hill cannot be hid .
o god , thou hast cast us off , thou hast scattered us , thou hast been displeased ; o turn thyself to us again .
and the lord spake to manasseh , and to his people : but they would not hearken .
thou hast made the earth to tremble ; thou hast broken it : heal the breaches thereof ; for it shaketh .
wherefore the lord brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of assyria , which took manasseh among the thorns , and bound him with fetters , and carried him to babylon .
thou hast shewed thy people hard things : thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment .
blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness ' sake : for theirs is the kingdom of heaven .
nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places , yet unto the lord their god only .
and he repaired the altar of the lord , and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings , and commanded judah to serve the lord god of israel .
his prayer also , and how god was intreated of him , and all his sin , and his trespass , and the places wherein he built high places , and set up groves and graven images , before he was humbled : behold , they are written among the sayings of the seers .
now the rest of the acts of manasseh , and his prayer unto his god , and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the lord god of israel , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of israel .
for if i by grace be a partaker , why am i evil spoken of for that for which i give thanks ?
a righteous man regardeth the life of his beast : but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel .
so shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you , when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the lord .
and the priests the sons of levi shall come near ; for them the lord thy god hath chosen to minister unto him , and to bless in the name of the lord ; and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be tried :
god standeth in the congregation of the mighty ; he judgeth among the gods .
and all the elders of that city , that are next unto the slain man , shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley :
and they shall answer and say , our hands have not shed this blood , neither have our eyes seen it .
defend the poor and fatherless : do justice to the afflicted and needy .
be merciful , o lord , unto thy people israel , whom thou hast redeemed , and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of israel ' s charge . and the blood shall be forgiven them .
how long will ye judge unjustly , and accept the persons of the wicked ? selah .
if one be found slain in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee to possess it , lying in the field , and it be not known who hath slain him :
then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth , and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain :
deliver the poor and needy : rid them out of the hand of the wicked .
and it shall be , that the city which is next unto the slain man , even the elders of that city shall take an heifer , which hath not been wrought with , and which hath not drawn in the yoke ;
but ye shall die like men , and fall like one of the princes .
and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley , which is neither eared nor sown , and shall strike off the heifer ' s neck there in the valley :
i have said , ye are gods ; and all of you are children of the most high .
even as i please all men in all things , not seeking mine own profit , but the profit of many , that they may be saved .
give none offence , neither to the jews , nor to the gentiles , nor to the church of god :
whether therefore ye eat , or drink , or whatsoever ye do , do all to the glory of god .
deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil : but to the counsellers of peace is joy .
there shall no evil happen to the just : but the wicked shall be filled with mischief .
arise , o god , judge the earth : for thou shalt inherit all nations .
the lip of truth shall be established for ever : but a lying tongue is but for a moment .
conscience , i say , not thine own , but of the other : for why is my liberty judged of another man ' s conscience ?
but if any man say unto you , this is offered in sacrifice unto idols , eat not for his sake that shewed it , and for conscience sake : for the earth is the lord ' s , and the fulness thereof :
whatsoever is sold in the shambles , that eat , asking no question for conscience sake :
a man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth : and the recompence of a man ' s hands shall be rendered unto him .
let no man seek his own , but every man another ' s wealth .
the wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips : but the just shall come out of trouble .
if any of them that believe not bid you to a feast , and ye be disposed to go ; whatsoever is set before you , eat , asking no question for conscience sake .
for the earth is the lord ' s , and the fulness thereof .
he that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread : but he that followeth vain persons is void of understanding .
ye cannot drink the cup of the lord , and the cup of devils : ye cannot be partakers of the lord ' s table , and of the table of devils .
there is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword : but the tongue of the wise is health .
but i say , that the things which the gentiles sacrifice , they sacrifice to devils , and not to god : and i would not that ye should have fellowship with devils .
he that speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness : but a false witness deceit .
all things are lawful for me , but all things are not expedient : all things are lawful for me , but all things edify not .
a fool ' s wrath is presently known : but a prudent man covereth shame .
do we provoke the lord to jealousy ? are we stronger than he ?
the way of a fool is right in his own eyes : but he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise .
who hath ears to hear , let him hear .
but other fell into good ground , and brought forth fruit , some an hundredfold , some sixtyfold , some thirtyfold .
and some fell among thorns ; and the thorns sprung up , and choked them :
and when the sun was up , they were scorched ; and because they had no root , they withered away .
some fell upon stony places , where they had not much earth : and forthwith they sprung up , because they had no deepness of earth :
and when he sowed , some seeds fell by the way side , and the fowls came and devoured them up :
and he spake many things unto them in parables , saying , behold , a sower went forth to sow ;
and great multitudes were gathered together unto him , so that he went into a ship , and sat ; and the whole multitude stood on the shore .
why hast thou prophesied in the name of the lord , saying , this house shall be like shiloh , and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant ? and all the people were gathered against jeremiah in the house of the lord .
now it came to pass , when jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the lord had commanded him to speak unto all the people , that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him , saying , thou shalt surely die .
so the priests and the prophets and all the people heard jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the lord .
to hearken to the words of my servants the prophets , whom i sent unto you , both rising up early , and sending them , but ye have not hearkened ;
then will i make this house like shiloh , and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth .
if so be they will hearken , and turn every man from his evil way , that i may repent me of the evil , which i purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings .
and thou shalt say unto them , thus saith the lord ; if ye will not hearken to me , to walk in my law , which i have set before you ,
the same day went jesus out of the house , and sat by the sea side .
in the beginning of the reign of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah came this word from the lord , saying ,
thus saith the lord ; stand in the court of the lord ' s house , and speak unto all the cities of judah , which come to worship in the lord ' s house , all the words that i command thee to speak unto them ; diminish not a word :
these things hast thou done , and i kept silence ; thou thoughtest that i was altogether such an one as thyself : but i will reprove thee , and set them in order before thine eyes .
now consider this , ye that forget god , lest i tear you in pieces , and there be none to deliver .
thou sittest and speakest against thy brother ; thou slanderest thine own mother ' s son .
that is , they which are the children of the flesh , these are not the children of god : but the children of the promise are counted for the seed .
neither , because they are the seed of abraham , are they all children : but , in isaac shall thy seed be called .
for this is the word of promise , at this time will i come , and sara shall have a son .
the words of the preacher , the son of david , king in jerusalem .
that i have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart .
i say the truth in christ , i lie not , my conscience also bearing me witness in the holy ghost ,
who are israelites ; to whom pertaineth the adoption , and the glory , and the covenants , and the giving of the law , and the service of god , and the promises ;
for i could wish that myself were accursed from christ for my brethren , my kinsmen according to the flesh :
not as though the word of god hath taken none effect . for they are not all israel , which are of israel :
whose are the fathers , and of whom as concerning the flesh christ came , who is over all , god blessed for ever . amen .
one generation passeth away , and another generation cometh : but the earth abideth for ever .
the sun also ariseth , and the sun goeth down , and hasteth to his place where he arose .
the wind goeth toward the south , and turneth about unto the north ; it whirleth about continually , and the wind returneth again according to his circuits .
all the rivers run into the sea ; yet the sea is not full ; unto the place from whence the rivers come , thither they return again .
all things are full of labour ; man cannot utter it : the eye is not satisfied with seeing , nor the ear filled with hearing .
the thing that hath been , it is that which shall be ; and that which is done is that which shall be done : and there is no new thing under the sun .
or else , while the other is yet a great way off , he sendeth an ambassage , and desireth conditions of peace .
so likewise , whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath , he cannot be my disciple .
saying , this man began to build , and was not able to finish .
or what king , going to make war against another king , sitteth not down first , and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand ?
salt is good : but if the salt have lost his savour , wherewith shall it be seasoned ?
it is neither fit for the land , nor yet for the dunghill ; but men cast it out . he that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
and another said , i have married a wife , and therefore i cannot come .
so that servant came , and shewed his lord these things . then the master of the house being angry said to his servant , go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city , and bring in hither the poor , and the maimed , and the halt , and the blind .
and the servant said , lord , it is done as thou hast commanded , and yet there is room .
and the lord said unto the servant , go out into the highways and hedges , and compel them to come in , that my house may be filled .
for i say unto you , that none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper .
and there went great multitudes with him : and he turned , and said unto them ,
if any man come to me , and hate not his father , and mother , and wife , and children , and brethren , and sisters , yea , and his own life also , he cannot be my disciple .
and whosoever doth not bear his cross , and come after me , cannot be my disciple .
for which of you , intending to build a tower , sitteth not down first , and counteth the cost , whether he have sufficient to finish it ?
lest haply , after he hath laid the foundation , and is not able to finish it , all that behold it begin to mock him ,
and thou shalt be blessed ; for they cannot recompense thee : for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just .
neither murmur ye , as some of them also murmured , and were destroyed of the destroyer .
and when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things , he said unto him , blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of god .
now all these things happened unto them for ensamples : and they are written for our admonition , upon whom the ends of the world are come .
then said he also to him that bade him , when thou makest a dinner or a supper , call not thy friends , nor thy brethren , neither thy kinsmen , nor thy rich neighbours ; lest they also bid thee again , and a recompence be made thee .
wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall .
but when thou makest a feast , call the poor , the maimed , the lame , the blind :
there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man : but god is faithful , who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able ; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape , that ye may be able to bear it .
but when thou art bidden , go and sit down in the lowest room ; that when he that bade thee cometh , he may say unto thee , friend , go up higher : then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee .
wherefore , my dearly beloved , flee from idolatry .
for whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased ; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted .
i speak as to wise men ; judge ye what i say .
for we being many are one bread , and one body : for we are all partakers of that one bread .
behold israel after the flesh : are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the alter ?
what say i then ? that the idol is any thing , or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing ?
and they all with one consent began to make excuse . the first said unto him , i have bought a piece of ground , and i must needs go and see it : i pray thee have me excused .
and another said , i have bought five yoke of oxen , and i go to prove them : i pray thee have me excused .
then said he unto him , a certain man made a great supper , and bade many :
and sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden , come ; for all things are now ready .
i know all the fowls of the mountains : and the wild beasts of the field are mine .
for every beast of the forest is mine , and the cattle upon a thousand hills .
now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto elisha , saying , thy servant my husband is dead ; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the lord : and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen .
then he said , go , borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours , even empty vessels ; borrow not a few .
seeing thou hatest instruction , and castest my words behind thee .
but unto the wicked god saith , what hast thou to do to declare my statutes , or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth ?
thou givest thy mouth to evil , and thy tongue frameth deceit .
when thou sawest a thief , then thou consentedst with him , and hast been partaker with adulterers .
if i were hungry , i would not tell thee : for the world is mine , and the fulness thereof .
offer unto god thanksgiving ; and pay thy vows unto the most high :
but ye are a chosen generation , a royal priesthood , an holy nation , a peculiar people ; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light :
and a stone of stumbling , and a rock of offence , even to them which stumble at the word , being disobedient : whereunto also they were appointed .
unto you therefore which believe he is precious : but unto them which be disobedient , the stone which the builders disallowed , the same is made the head of the corner ,
and when thou art come in , thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons , and shalt pour out into all those vessels , and thou shalt set aside that which is full .
wherefore also it is contained in the scripture , behold , i lay in sion a chief corner stone , elect , precious : and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded .
ye also , as lively stones , are built up a spiritual house , an holy priesthood , to offer up spiritual sacrifices , acceptable to god by jesus christ .
and it came to pass , when the vessels were full , that she said unto her son , bring me yet a vessel . and he said unto her , there is not a vessel more . and the oil stayed .
to whom coming , as unto a living stone , disallowed indeed of men , but chosen of god , and precious ,
then she came and told the man of god . and he said , go , sell the oil , and pay thy debt , and live thou and thy children of the rest .
if so be ye have tasted that the lord is gracious .
as newborn babes , desire the sincere milk of the word , that ye may grow thereby :
and she said unto her husband , behold now , i perceive that this is an holy man of god , which passeth by us continually .
wherefore laying aside all malice , and all guile , and hypocrisies , and envies , and all evil speakings ,
speak , ye that ride on white asses , ye that sit in judgment , and walk by the way .
they that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water , there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the lord , even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages in israel : then shall the people of the lord go down to the gates .
awake , awake , deborah : awake , awake , utter a song : arise , barak , and lead thy captivity captive , thou son of abinoam .
zebulun and naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field .
the kings came and fought , then fought the kings of canaan in taanach by the waters of megiddo ; they took no gain of money .
then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people : the lord made me have dominion over the mighty .
out of ephraim was there a root of them against amalek ; after thee , benjamin , among thy people ; out of machir came down governors , and out of zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer .
and the princes of issachar were with deborah ; even issachar , and also barak : he was sent on foot into the valley . for the divisions of reuben there were great thoughts of heart .
why abodest thou among the sheepfolds , to hear the bleatings of the flocks ? for the divisions of reuben there were great searchings of heart .
and he spread it before me ; and it was written within and without : and there was written therein lamentations , and mourning , and woe .
therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance , that ye commit not any one of these abominable customs , which were committed before you , and that ye defile not yourselves therein : i am the lord your god .
then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings , the pransings of their mighty ones .
curse ye meroz , said the angel of the lord , curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof ; because they came not to the help of the lord , to the help of the lord against the mighty .
they fought from heaven ; the stars in their courses fought against sisera .
the river of kishon swept them away , that ancient river , the river kishon . o my soul , thou hast trodden down strength .
the mother of sisera looked out at a window , and cried through the lattice , why is his chariot so long in coming ? why tarry the wheels of his chariots ?
her wise ladies answered her , yea , she returned answer to herself ,
she put her hand to the nail , and her right hand to the workmen ' s hammer ; and with the hammer she smote sisera , she smote off his head , when she had pierced and stricken through his temples .
at her feet he bowed , he fell , he lay down : at her feet he bowed , he fell : where he bowed , there he fell down dead .
blessed above women shall jael the wife of heber the kenite be , blessed shall she be above women in the tent .
he asked water , and she gave him milk ; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish .
thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter , neither shalt thou take her son ' s daughter , or her daughter ' s daughter , to uncover her nakedness ; for they are her near kinswomen : it is wickedness .
neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister , to vex her , to uncover her nakedness , beside the other in her life time .
also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness , as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness .
have they not sped ? have they not divided the prey ; to every man a damsel or two ; to sisera a prey of divers colours , a prey of divers colours of needlework , of divers colours of needlework on both sides , meet for the necks of them that take the spoil ?
so let all thine enemies perish , o lord : but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might . and the land had rest forty years .
the nakedness of thy son ' s daughter , or of thy daughter ' s daughter , even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover : for theirs is thine own nakedness .
thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father ' s sister : she is thy father ' s near kinswoman .
the nakedness of thy father ' s wife ' s daughter , begotten of thy father , she is thy sister , thou shalt not uncover her nakedness .
thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father ' s brother , thou shalt not approach to his wife : she is thine aunt .
thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother ' s sister : for she is thy mother ' s near kinswoman .
thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother ' s wife : it is thy brother ' s nakedness .
thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter in law : she is thy son ' s wife ; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness .
that the land spue not you out also , when ye defile it , as it spued out the nations that were before you .
neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith : neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto : it is confusion .
thou shalt not lie with mankind , as with womankind : it is abomination .
and thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to molech , neither shalt thou profane the name of thy god : i am the lord .
moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour ' s wife , to defile thyself with her .
( for all these abominations have the men of the land done , which were before you , and the land is defiled ; )
ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments , and shall not commit any of these abominations ; neither any of your own nation , nor any stranger that sojourneth among you :
and the land is defiled : therefore i do visit the iniquity thereof upon it , and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants .
defile not ye yourselves in any of these things : for in all these the nations are defiled which i cast out before you :
who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world , but was manifest in these last times for you ,
being born again , not of corruptible seed , but of incorruptible , by the word of god , which liveth and abideth for ever .
who by him do believe in god , that raised him up from the dead , and gave him glory ; that your faith and hope might be in god .
seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren , see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently :
but the word of the lord endureth for ever . and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you .
of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently , who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you :
searching what , or what manner of time the spirit of christ which was in them did signify , when it testified beforehand the sufferings of christ , and the glory that should follow .
unto whom it was revealed , that not unto themselves , but unto us they did minister the things , which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the holy ghost sent down from heaven ; which things the angels desire to look into .
wherefore gird up the loins of your mind , be sober , and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of jesus christ ;
as obedient children , not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance :
but as he which hath called you is holy , so be ye holy in all manner of conversation ;
because it is written , be ye holy ; for i am holy .
and if ye call on the father , who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man ' s work , pass the time of your sojourning here in fear :
but with the precious blood of christ , as of a lamb without blemish and without spot :
thus speaketh the lord of hosts , the god of israel , saying , i have broken the yoke of the king of babylon .
and the days of isaac were an hundred and fourscore years .
and i will bring again to this place jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah , with all the captives of judah , that went into babylon , saith the lord : for i will break the yoke of the king of babylon .
and isaac gave up the ghost , and died , and was gathered unto his people , being old and full of days : and his sons esau and jacob buried him .
within two full years will i bring again into this place all the vessels of the lord ' s house , that nebuchadnezzar king of babylon took away from this place , and carried them to babylon :
and the sons of zilpah , leah ' s handmaid ; gad , and asher : these are the sons of jacob , which were born to him in padan - aram .
at that time did hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the lord , and from the pillars which hezekiah king of judah had overlaid , and gave it to the king of assyria .
and jacob came unto isaac his father unto mamre , unto the city of arbah , which is hebron , where abraham and isaac sojourned .
and hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the lord , and in the treasures of the king ' s house .
the sons of rachel ; joseph , and benjamin :
and hezekiah king of judah sent to the king of assyria to lachish , saying , i have offended ; return from me : that which thou puttest on me will i bear . and the king of assyria appointed unto hezekiah king of judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold .
and the sons of bilhah , rachel ' s handmaid ; dan , and naphtali :
the sons of leah ; reuben , jacob ' s firstborn , and simeon , and levi , and judah , and issachar , and zebulun :
and rab - shakeh said unto them , speak ye now to hezekiah , thus saith the great king , the king of assyria , what confidence is this wherein thou trustest ?
and jacob set a pillar upon her grave : that is the pillar of rachel ' s grave unto this day .
and when they had called to the king , there came out to them eliakim the son of hilkiah , which was over the household , and shebna the scribe , and joah the son of asaph the recorder .
and israel journeyed , and spread his tent beyond the tower of edar .
thou sayest , ( but they are but vain words , ) i have counsel and strength for the war . now on whom dost thou trust , that thou rebellest against me ?
now therefore , i pray thee , give pledges to my lord the king of assyria , and i will deliver thee two thousand horses , if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them .
how then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master ' s servants , and put thy trust on egypt for chariots and for horsemen ?
now , behold , thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed , even upon egypt , on which if a man lean , it will go into his hand , and pierce it : so is pharoah king of egypt unto all that trust on him .
but if ye say unto me , we trust in the lord our god : is not that he , whose high places and whose altars hezekiah hath taken away , and hath said to judah and jerusalem , ye shall worship before this altar in jerusalem ?
then the prophet jeremiah said unto the prophet hananiah in the presence of the priests , and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the lord ,
even the prophet jeremiah said , amen : the lord do so : the lord perform thy words which thou hast prophesied , to bring again the vessels of the lord ' s house , and all that is carried away captive , from babylon into this place .
nevertheless hear thou now this word that i speak in thine ears , and in the ears of all the people ;
the prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries , and against great kingdoms , of war , and of evil , and of pestilence .
the prophet which prophesieth of peace , when the word of the prophet shall come to pass , then shall the prophet be known , that the lord hath truly sent him .
and at the end of three years they took it : even in the sixth year of hezekiah , that is the ninth year of hoshea king of israel , samaria was taken .
and the king of assyria did carry away israel unto assyria , and put them in halah and in habor by the river of gozan , and in the cities of the medes :
because they obeyed not the voice of the lord their god , but transgressed his covenant , and all that moses the servant of the lord commanded , and would not hear them , nor do them .
now in the fourteenth year of king hezekiah did sennacherib king of assyria come up against all the fenced cities of judah , and took them .
but in the last days it shall come to pass , that the mountain of the house of the lord shall be established in the top of the mountains , and it shall be exalted above the hills ; and people shall flow unto it .
and he shall judge among many people , and rebuke strong nations afar off ; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares , and their spears into pruninghooks : nation shall not lift up a sword against nation , neither shall they learn war any more .
but they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree ; and none shall make them afraid : for the mouth of the lord of hosts hath spoken it .
but the people held their peace , and answered him not a word : for the king ' s commandment was , saying , answer him not .
then came eliakim the son of hilkiah , which was over the household , and shebna the scribe , and joah the son of asaph the recorder , to hezekiah with their clothes rent , and told him the words of rab - shakeh .
now why dost thou cry out aloud ? is there no king in thee ? is thy counseller perished ? for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail .
for all people will walk every one in the name of his god , and we will walk in the name of the lord our god for ever and ever .
in that day , saith the lord , will i assemble her that halteth , and i will gather her that is driven out , and her that i have afflicted ;
and i will make her that halted a remnant , and her that was cast far off a strong nation : and the lord shall reign over them in mount zion from henceforth , even for ever .
and thou , o tower of the flock , the strong hold of the daughter of zion , unto thee shall it come , even the first dominion ; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of jerusalem .
and it came to pass , as the ark of the covenant of the lord came to the city of david , that michal the daughter of saul looking out at a window saw king david dancing and playing : and she despised him in her heart .
come , my people , enter thou into thy chambers , and shut thy doors about thee : hide thyself as it were for a little moment , until the indignation be overpast .
thus all israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the lord with shouting , and with sound of the cornet , and with trumpets , and with cymbals , making a noise with psalteries and harps .
for , behold , the lord cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity : the earth also shall disclose her blood , and shall no more cover her slain .
so david , and the elders of israel , and the captains over thousands , went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the lord out of the house of obed - edom with joy .
and shebaniah , and jehoshaphat , and nethaneel , and amasai , and zechariah , and benaiah , and eliezer , the priests , did blow with the trumpets before the ark of god : and obed - edom and jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark .
and david was clothed with a robe of fine linen , and all the levites that bare the ark , and the singers , and chenaniah the master of the song with the singers : david also had upon him an ephod of linen .
and it came to pass , when god helped the levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the lord , that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams .
and mattithiah , and elipheleh , and mikneiah , and obed - edom , and jeiel , and azaziah , with harps on the sheminith to excel .
and berechiah and elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark .
and chenaniah , chief of the levites , was for song : he instructed about the song , because he was skilful .
thus saith the king , let not hezekiah deceive you : for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand :
and god said unto him , thy name is jacob : thy name shall not be called any more jacob , but israel shall be thy name : and he called his name israel .
but thou shalt in any wise let the dam go , and take the young to thee ; that it may be well with thee , and that thou mayest prolong thy days .
if a bird ' s nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree , or on the ground , whether they be young ones , or eggs , and the dam sitting upon the young , or upon the eggs , thou shalt not take the dam with the young :
and the land which i gave abraham and isaac , to thee i will give it , and to thy seed after thee will i give the land .
the woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man , neither shall a man put on a woman ' s garment : for all that do so are abomination unto the lord thy god .
and god said unto him , i am god almighty : be fruitful and multiply ; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee , and kings shall come out of thy loins ;
thou shalt not see thy brother ' s ass or his ox fall down by the way , and hide thyself from them : thou shalt surely help him to lift them up again .
am i now come up without the lord against this place to destroy it ? the lord said to me , go up against this land , and destroy it .
in like manner shalt thou do with his ass ; and so shalt thou do with his raiment ; and with all lost thing of thy brother ' s , which he hath lost , and thou hast found , shalt thou do likewise : thou mayest not hide thyself .
then said eliakim the son of hilkiah , and shebna , and joah , unto rab - shakeh , speak , i pray thee , to thy servants in the syrian language ; for we understand it : and talk not with us in the jews ' language in the ears of the people that are on the wall .
and god went up from him in the place where he talked with him .
and if thy brother be not nigh unto thee , or if thou know him not , then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house , and it shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it , and thou shalt restore it to him again .
but rab - shakeh said unto them , hath my master sent me to thy master , and to thee , to speak these words ? hath he not sent me to the men which sit on the wall , that they may eat their own dung , and drink their own piss with you .
and they journeyed from bethel ; and there was but a little way to come to ephrath : and rachel travailed , and she had hard labour .
thou shalt not see the brother ' s ox or his sheep go astray , and hide thyself from them : thou shalt in any case bring them again unto thy brother .
then rab - shakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the jews ' language , and spake , saying , hear the word of the great king , the king of assyria :
and jacob called the name of the place where god spake with him , bethel .
and it came to pass , as her soul was in departing , ( for she died ) that she called his name ben - oni : but his father called him benjamin .
the hand of the diligent shall bear rule : but the slothful shall be under tribute .
and it came to pass , when she was in hard labour , that the midwife said unto her , fear not ; thou shalt have this son also .
heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop : but a good word maketh it glad .
lying lips are abomination to the lord : but they that deal truly are his delight .
and rachel died , and was buried in the way to ephrath , which is bethlehem .
a prudent man concealeth knowledge : but the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness .
in the way of righteousness is life ; and in the pathway thereof there is no death .
the righteous is more excellent than his neighbour : but the way of the wicked seduceth them .
the slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting : but the substance of a diligent man is precious .
so the singers , heman , asaph , and ethan , were appointed to sound with cymbals of brass ;
and with them their brethren of the second degree , zechariah , ben , and jaaziel , and shemiramoth , and jehiel , and unni , eliab , and benaiah , and maaseiah , and mattithiah , and elipheleh , and mikneiah , and obed - edom , and jeiel , the porters .
so the levites appointed heman the son of joel ; and of his brethren , asaph the son of berechiah ; and of the sons of merari their brethren , ethan the son of kushaiah ;
and david spake to the chief of the levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick , psalteries and harps and cymbals , sounding , by lifting up the voice with joy .
so the priests and the levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the lord god of israel .
for because ye did it not at the first , the lord our god made a breach upon us , for that we sought him not after the due order .
and said unto them , ye are the chief of the fathers of the levites : sanctify yourselves , both ye and your brethren , that ye may bring up the ark of the lord god of israel unto the place that i have prepared for it .
hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of assyria ?
and david called for zadok and abiathar the priests , and for the levites , for uriel , asaiah , and joel , shemaiah , and eliel , and amminadab ,
of the sons of uzziel ; amminadab the chief , and his brethren an hundred and twelve .
who are they among all the gods of the countries , that have delivered their country out of mine hand , that the lord should deliver jerusalem out of mine hand ?
where are the gods of hamath , and of arpad ? where are the gods of sepharvaim , hena , and ivah ? have they delivered samaria out of mine hand ?
when thou buildest a new house , then thou shalt make a battlement for thy roof , that thou bring not blood upon thine house , if any man fall from thence .
neither let hezekiah make you trust in the lord , saying , the lord will surely deliver us , and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of assyria .
thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds : lest the fruit of thy seed which thou hast sown , and the fruit of thy vineyard , be defiled .
so will i sing praise unto thy name for ever , that i may daily perform my vows .
he shall abide before god for ever : o prepare mercy and truth , which may preserve him .
hear my cry , o god ; attend unto my prayer .
from the end of the earth will i cry unto thee , when my heart is overwhelmed : lead me to the rock that is higher than i .
they shall therefore keep mine ordinance , lest they bear sin for it , and die therefore , if they profane it : i the lord do sanctify them .
for thou hast been a shelter for me , and a strong tower from the enemy .
i will abide in thy tabernacle for ever : i will trust in the covert of thy wings . selah .
for thou , o god , hast heard my vows : thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name .
thou wilt prolong the king ' s life : and his years as many generations .
or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing , whereby he may be made unclean , or a man of whom he may take uncleanness , whatsoever uncleanness he hath ;
and when the sun is down , he shall be clean , and shall afterward eat of the holy things ; because it is his food .
that which dieth of itself , or is torn with beasts , he shall not eat to defile himself therewith : i am the lord .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
speak unto aaron and to his sons , that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of israel , and that they profane not my holy name in those things which they hallow unto me : i am the lord .
say unto them , whosoever he be of all your seed among your generations , that goeth unto the holy things , which the children of israel hallow unto the lord , having his uncleanness upon him , that soul shall be cut off from my presence : i am the lord .
what man soever of the seed of aaron is a leper , or hath a running issue ; he shall not eat of the holy things , until he be clean . and whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead , or a man whose seed goeth from him ;
lord , when thy hand is lifted up , they will not see : but they shall see , and be ashamed for their envy at the people ; yea , the fire of thine enemies shall devour them .
let favour be shewed to the wicked , yet will he not learn righteousness : in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly , and will not behold the majesty of the lord .
thou hast increased the nation , o lord , thou hast increased the nation : thou art glorified : thou hadst removed it far unto all the ends of the earth .
they are dead , they shall not live ; they are deceased , they shall not rise : therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them , and made all their memory to perish .
o lord our god , other lords beside thee have had dominion over us : but by thee only will we make mention of thy name .
lord , thou wilt ordain peace for us : for thou also hast wrought all our works in us .
thy dead men shall live , together with my dead body shall they arise . awake and sing , ye that dwell in dust : for thy dew is as the dew of herbs , and the earth shall cast out the dead .
we have been with child , we have been in pain , we have as it were brought forth wind ; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth ; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen .
like as a woman with child , that draweth near the time of her delivery , is in pain , and crieth out in her pangs ; so have we been in thy sight , o lord .
lord , in trouble have they visited thee , they poured out a prayer when thy chastening was upon them .
saul and jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives , and in their death they were not divided : they were swifter than eagles , they were stronger than lions .
ye daughters of israel , weep over saul , who clothed you in scarlet , with other delights , who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel .
how are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle ! o jonathan , thou was slain in thine high places .
i am distressed for thee , my brother jonathan : very pleasant hast thou been unto me : thy love to me was wonderful , passing the love of women .
how are the mighty fallen , and the weapons of war perished !
tell it not in gath , publish it not in the streets of askelon ; lest the daughters of the philistines rejoice , lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph .
ye mountains of gilboa , let there be no dew , neither let there be rain , upon you , nor fields of offerings : for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away , the shield of saul , as though he had not been anointed with oil .
from the blood of the slain , from the fat of the mighty , the bow of jonathan turned not back , and the sword of saul returned not empty .
and he brought forth the people that were therein , and put them under saws , and under harrows of iron , and under axes of iron , and made them pass through the brickkiln : and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of ammon . so david and all the people returned unto jerusalem .
and he took their king ' s crown from off his head , the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones : and it was set on david ' s head . and he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance .
now therefore gather the rest of the people together , and encamp against the city , and take it : lest i take the city , and it be called after my name .
and joab sent messengers to david , and said , i have fought against rabbah , and have taken the city of waters .
and david gathered all the people together , and went to rabbah , and fought against it , and took it .
and david comforted bath - sheba his wife , and went in unto her , and lay with her : and she bare a son , and he called his name solomon : and the lord loved him .
but now he is dead , wherefore should i fast ? can i bring him back again ? i shall go to him , but he shall not return to me .
and joab fought against rabbah of the children of ammon , and took the royal city .
then david arose from the earth , and washed , and anointed himself , and changed his apparel , and came into the house of the lord , and worshipped : then he came to his own house ; and when he required , they set bread before him , and he did eat .
and he said , while the child was yet alive , i fasted and wept : for i said , who can tell whether god will be gracious to me , that the child may live ?
then said his servants unto him , what thing is this that thou hast done ? thou didst fast and weep for the child , while it was alive ; but when the child was dead , thou didst rise and eat bread .
but when david saw that his servants whispered , david perceived that the child was dead : therefore david said unto his servants , is the child dead ? and they said , he is dead .
and the elders of his house arose , and went to him , to raise him up from the earth : but he would not , neither did he eat bread with them .
david therefore besought god for the child ; and david fasted , and went in , and lay all night upon the earth .
and nathan departed unto his house . and the lord struck the child that uriah ' s wife bare unto david , and it was very sick .
howbeit , because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the lord to blaspheme , the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die .
and david said unto nathan , i have sinned against the lord . and nathan said unto david , the lord also hath put away thy sin ; thou shalt not die .
for thou didst it secretly : but i will do this thing before all israel , and before the sun .
thus saith the lord , behold , i will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house , and i will take thy wives before thine eyes , and give them unto thy neighbour , and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun .
now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house ; because thou hast despised me , and hast taken the wife of uriah the hittite to be thy wife .
( also he bade them teach the children of judah the use of the bow : behold , it is written in the book of jasher . )
the beauty of israel is slain upon thy high places : how are the mighty fallen !
and david said unto him , thy blood be upon thy head ; for thy mouth hath testified against thee , saying , i have slain the lord ' s anointed .
and david lamented with this lamentation over saul and over jonathan his son :
and david said unto him , how wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the lord ' s anointed ?
and david called one of the young men , and said , go near , and fall upon him . and he smote him that he died .
and they mourned , and wept , and fasted until even , for saul , and for jonathan his son , and for the people of the lord , and for the house of israel ; because they were fallen by the sword .
and david said unto the young man that told him , whence art thou ? and he answered , i am the son of a stranger , an amalekite .
so i stood upon him , and slew him , because i was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen : and i took the crown that was upon his head , and the bracelet that was on his arm , and have brought them hither unto my lord .
then david took hold on his clothes , and rent them ; and likewise all the men that were with him :
for john said unto him , it is not lawful for thee to have her .
for herod had laid hold on john , and bound him , and put him in prison for herodias ' sake , his brother philip ' s wife .
and said unto his servants , this is john the baptist ; he is risen from the dead ; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him .
and she , being before instructed of her mother , said , give me here john baptist ' s head in a charger .
whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask .
but when herod ' s birthday was kept , the daughter of herodias danced before them , and pleased herod .
and when he would have put him to death , he feared the multitude , because they counted him as a prophet .
and the king was sorry : nevertheless for the oath ' s sake , and them which sat with him at meat , he commanded it to be given her .
they have taken crafty counsel against thy people , and consulted against thy hidden ones .
they have said , come , and let us cut them off from being a nation ; that the name of israel may be no more in remembrance .
for they have consulted together with one consent : they are confederate against thee :
the tabernacles of edom , and the ishmaelites ; of moab , and the hagarenes ;
keep not thou silence , o god : hold not thy peace , and be not still , o god .
for , lo , thine enemies make a tumult : and they that hate thee have lifted up the head .
so they came and called unto the porter of the city : and they told them , saying , we came to the camp of the syrians , and , behold , there was no man there , neither voice of man , but horses tied , and asses tied , and the tents as they were .
and he called the porters ; and they told it to the king ' s house within .
they took therefore two chariot horses ; and the king sent after the host of the syrians , saying , go and see .
and they went after them unto jordan : and , lo , all the way was full of garments and vessels , which the syrians had cast away in their haste . and the messengers returned , and told the king .
and the people went out , and spoiled the tents of the syrians . so a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel , and two measures of barley for a shekel , according to the word of the lord .
and the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate : and the people trode upon him in the gate , and he died , as the man of god had said , who spake when the king came down to him .
and it came to pass as the man of god had spoken to the king , saying , two measures of barley for a shekel , and a measure of fine flour for a shekel , shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of samaria :
and that lord answered the man of god , and said , now , behold , if the lord should make windows in heaven , might such a thing be ? and he said , behold , thou shalt see it with thine eyes , but shalt not eat thereof .
do unto them as unto the midianites ; as to sisera , as to jabin , at the brook of kison :
assur also is joined with them : they have holpen the children of lot . selah .
gebal , and ammon , and amalek ; the philistines with the inhabitants of tyre ;
and so it fell out unto him : for the people trode upon him in the gate , and he died .
and the lord of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of midian at the rock of oreb : and as his rod was upon the sea , so shall he lift it up after the manner of egypt .
judgments are prepared for scorners , and stripes for the back of fools .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder , and his yoke from off thy neck , and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing .
he is come to aiath , he is passed to migron ; at michmash he hath laid up his carriages :
they are gone over the passage : they have taken up their lodging at geba ; ramah is afraid ; gibeah of saul is fled .
and azariah , ezra , and meshullam ,
for the lord god of hosts shall make a consumption , even determined , in the midst of all the land .
judah , and benjamin , and shemaiah , and jeremiah ,
for though thy people israel be as the sand of the sea , yet a remnant of them shall return : the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness .
and certain of the priests ' sons with trumpets ; namely , zechariah the son of jonathan , the son of shemaiah , the son of mattaniah , the son of michaiah , the son of zaccur , the son of asaph :
for yet a very little while , and the indignation shall cease , and mine anger in their destruction .
and his brethren , shemaiah , and azarael , milalai , gilalai , maai , nethaneel , and judah , hanani , with the musical instruments of david the man of god , and ezra the scribe before them .
therefore thus saith the lord god of hosts , o my people that dwellest in zion , be not afraid of the assyrian : he shall smite thee with a rod , and shall lift up his staff against thee , after the manner of egypt .
and the priests and the levites purified themselves , and purified the people , and the gates , and the wall .
then i brought up the princes of judah upon the wall , and appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks , whereof one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate :
if my land cry against me , or that the furrows likewise thereof complain ;
the remnant shall return , even the remnant of jacob , unto the mighty god .
and after them went hoshaiah , and half of the princes of judah ,
if i have eaten the fruits thereof without money , or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life :
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the remnant of israel , and such as are escaped of the house of jacob , shall no more again stay upon him that smote them ; but shall stay upon the lord , the holy one of israel , in truth .
surely i would take it upon my shoulder , and bind it as a crown to me .
i would declare unto him the number of my steps ; as a prince would i go near unto him .
did i fear a great multitude , or did the contempt of families terrify me , that i kept silence , and went not out of the door ?
oh that one would hear me ! behold , my desire is , that the almighty would answer me , and that mine adversary had written a book .
and at the fountain gate , which was over against them , they went up by the stairs of the city of david , at the going up of the wall , above the house of david , even unto the water gate eastward .
the stranger did not lodge in the street : but i opened my doors to the traveller .
and the other company of them that gave thanks went over against them , and i after them , and the half of the people upon the wall , from beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall ;
if i covered my transgressions as adam , by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom :
and from above the gate of ephraim , and above the old gate , and above the fish gate , and the tower of hananeel , and the tower of meah , even unto the sheep gate : and they stood still in the prison gate .
neither have i suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul .
if the men of my tabernacle said not , oh that we had of his flesh ! we cannot be satisfied .
blessed be god , which hath not turned away my prayer , nor his mercy from me .
let thistles grow instead of wheat , and cockle instead of barley . the words of job are ended .
a man of great wrath shall suffer punishment : for if thou deliver him , yet thou must do it again .
chasten thy son while there is hope , and let not thy soul spare for his crying .
for in the days of david and asaph of old there were chief of the singers , and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto god .
cease , my son , to hear the instruction that causeth to err from the words of knowledge .
and all israel in the days of zerubbabel , and in the days of nehemiah , gave the portions of the singers and the porters , every day his portion : and they sanctified holy things unto the levites ; and the levites sanctified them unto the children of aaron .
smite a scorner , and the simple will beware : and reprove one that hath understanding , and he will understand knowledge .
and he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron , and lebanon shall fall by a mighty one .
and both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their god , and the ward of the purification , according to the commandment of david , and of solomon his son .
he that wasteth his father , and chaseth away his mother , is a son that causeth shame , and bringeth reproach .
behold , the lord , the lord of hosts , shall lop the bough with terror : and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down , and the haughty shall be humbled .
and maaseiah , and shemaiah , and eleazar , and uzzi , and jehohanan , and malchijah , and elam , and ezer . and the singers sang loud , with jezrahiah their overseer .
the fear of the lord tendeth to life : and he that hath it shall abide satisfied ; he shall not be visited with evil .
as yet shall he remain at nob that day : he shall shake his hand against the mount of the daughter of zion , the hill of jerusalem .
also that day they offered great sacrifices , and rejoiced : for god had made them rejoice with great joy : the wives also and the children rejoiced : so that the joy of jerusalem was heard even afar off .
a slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom , and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again .
madmenah is removed ; the inhabitants of gebim gather themselves to flee .
so stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of god , and i , and the half of the rulers with me :
there are many devices in a man ' s heart ; nevertheless the counsel of the lord , that shall stand .
lift up thy voice , o daughter of gallim : cause it to be heard unto laish , o poor anathoth .
and the priests ; eliakim , maaseiah , miniamin , michaiah , elioenai , zechariah , and hananiah , with trumpets ;
the desire of a man is his kindness : and a poor man is better than a liar .
hear counsel , and receive instruction , that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end .
i will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings , with the incense of rams ; i will offer bullocks with goats . selah .
come and hear , all ye that fear god , and i will declare what he hath done for my soul .
i will go into thy house with burnt offerings : i will pay thee my vows ,
which my lips have uttered , and my mouth hath spoken , when i was in trouble .
thou broughtest us into the net ; thou laidst affliction upon our loins .
thou hast caused men to ride over our heads ; we went through fire and through water : but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place .
for thou , o god , hast proved us : thou hast tried us , as silver is tried .
but verily god hath heard me ; he hath attended to the voice of my prayer .
i cried unto him with my mouth , and he was extolled with my tongue .
if i regard iniquity in my heart , the lord will not hear me :
( for from my youth he was brought up with me , as with a father , and i have guided her from my mother ' s womb ; )
if i have seen any perish for want of clothing , or any poor without covering ;
if i have withheld the poor from their desire , or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail ;
or have eaten my morsel myself alone , and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof ;
then let my wife grind unto another , and let others bow down upon her .
for this is an heinous crime ; yea , it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges .
what then shall i do when god riseth up ? and when he visiteth , what shall i answer him ?
did not he that made me in the womb make him ? and did not one fashion us in the womb ?
for it is a fire that consumeth to destruction , and would root out all mine increase .
if i did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant , when they contended with me ;
i have not eaten thereof in my mourning , neither have i taken away ought thereof for any unclean use , nor given ought thereof for the dead : but i have hearkened to the voice of the lord my god , and have done according to all that thou hast commanded me .
and thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the lord thy god hath given unto thee , and unto thine house , thou , and the levite , and the stranger that is among you .
when thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine increase the third year , which is the year of tithing , and hast given it unto the levite , the stranger , the fatherless , and the widow , that they may eat within thy gates , and be filled ;
and now , behold , i have brought the firstfruits of the land , which thou , o lord , hast given me . and thou shalt set it before the lord thy god , and worship before the lord thy god :
thou hast avouched the lord this day to be thy god , and to walk in his ways , and to keep his statutes , and his commandments , and his judgments , and to hearken unto his voice :
and the lord hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people , as he hath promised thee , and that thou shouldest keep all his commandments ;
look down from thy holy habitation , from heaven , and bless thy people israel , and the land which thou hast given us , as thou swarest unto our fathers , a land that floweth with milk and honey .
this day the lord thy god hath commanded thee to do these statutes and judgments : thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thine heart , and with all thy soul .
and my heart hath been secretly enticed , or my mouth hath kissed my hand :
this also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge : for i should have denied the god that is above .
if i rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me , or lifted up myself when evil found him :
if his loins have not blessed me , and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep ;
if i have lifted up my hand against the fatherless , when i saw my help in the gate :
then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade , and mine arm be broken from the bone .
for destruction from god was a terror to me , and by reason of his highness i could not endure .
if i have made gold my hope , or have said to the fine gold , thou art my confidence ;
if i rejoiced because my wealth was great , and because mine hand had gotten much ;
if i beheld the sun when it shined , or the moon walking in brightness ;
go ye , get you straw where ye can find it : yet not ought of your work shall be diminished .
and the taskmasters of the people went out , and their officers , and they spake to the people , saying , thus saith pharaoh , i will not give you straw .
and the taskmasters hasted them , saying , fulfil your works , your daily tasks , as when there was straw .
so the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of egypt to gather stubble instead of straw .
then the officers of the children of israel came and cried unto pharaoh , saying , wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants ?
and the officers of the children of israel , which pharaoh ' s taskmasters had set over them , were beaten , and demanded , wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day , as heretofore ?
but he said , ye are idle , ye are idle : therefore ye say , let us go and do sacrifice to the lord .
there is no straw given unto thy servants , and they say to us , make brick : and , behold , thy servants are beaten ; but the fault is in thine own people .
and the officers of the children of israel did see that they were in evil case , after it was said , ye shall not minish ought from your bricks of your daily task .
go therefore now , and work ; for there shall no straw be given you , yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks .
slay utterly old and young , both maids , and little children , and women : but come not near any man upon whom is the mark ; and begin at my sanctuary . then they began at the ancient men which were before the house .
and to the others he said in mine hearing , go ye after him through the city , and smite : let not your eye spare , neither have ye pity :
and the glory of the god of israel was gone up from the cherub , whereupon he was , to the threshold of the house . and he called to the man clothed with linen , which had the writer ' s inkhorn by his side ;
he cried also in mine ears with a loud voice , saying , cause them that have charge over the city to draw near , even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand .
and he said unto them , defile the house , and fill the courts with the slain : go ye forth . and they went forth , and slew in the city .
that as sin hath reigned unto death , even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by jesus christ our lord .
moreover the law entered , that the offence might abound . but where sin abounded , grace did much more abound :
the discretion of a man deferreth his anger ; and it is his glory to pass over a transgression .
delight is not seemly for a fool ; much less for a servant to have rule over princes .
a foolish son is the calamity of his father : and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping .
the king ' s wrath is as the roaring of a lion ; but his favour is as dew upon the grass .
slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep ; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger .
house and riches are the inheritance of fathers and a prudent wife is from the lord .
he that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the lord ; and that which he hath given will he pay him again .
he that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul ; but he that despiseth his ways shall die .
and moses returned unto the lord , and said , lord , wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people ? why is it that thou hast sent me ?
and shall consume the glory of his forest , and of his fruitful field , both soul and body : and they shall be as when a standardbearer fainteth .
and they said unto them , the lord look upon you , and judge ; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of pharaoh , and in the eyes of his servants , to put a sword in their hand to slay us .
and the light of israel shall be for a fire , and his holy one for a flame : and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day ;
and they met moses and aaron , who stood in the way , as they came forth from pharaoh :
therefore shall the lord , the lord of hosts , send among his fat ones leanness ; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire .
shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith ? or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it ? as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up , or as if the staff should lift up itself , as if it were no wood .
and the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few , that a child may write them .
and he wrought evil in the sight of the lord ; but not like his father , and like his mother : for he put away the image of baal that his father had made .
now jehoram the son of ahab began to reign over israel in samaria the eighteenth year of jehoshaphat king of judah , and reigned twelve years .
and mesha king of moab was a sheepmaster , and rendered unto the king of israel an hundred thousand lambs , and an hundred thousand rams , with the wool .
nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat , which made israel to sin ; he departed not therefrom .
for since i came to pharaoh to speak in thy name , he hath done evil to this people ; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all .
so the king of israel went , and the king of judah , and the king of edom : and they fetched a compass of seven days ' journey : and there was no water for the host , and for the cattle that followed them .
and not only so , but we also joy in god through our lord jesus christ , by whom we have now received the atonement .
wherefore , as by one man sin entered into the world , and death by sin ; and so death passed upon all men , for that all have sinned :
but it came to pass , when ahab was dead , that the king of moab rebelled against the king of israel .
and king jehoram went out of samaria the same time , and numbered all israel .
nevertheless death reigned from adam to moses , even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of adam ' s transgression , who is the figure of him that was to come .
but not as the offence , so also is the free gift . for if through the offence of one many be dead , much more the grace of god , and the gift by grace , which is by one man , jesus christ , hath abounded unto many .
and he said , which way shall we go up ? and he answered , the way through the wilderness of edom .
and not as it was by one that sinned , so is the gift : for the judgment was by one to condemnation , but the free gift is of many offences unto justification .
for if by one man ' s offence death reigned by one ; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one , jesus christ . )
as my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols , and whose graven images did excel them of jerusalem and of samaria ;
therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation ; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life .
for as by one man ' s disobedience many were made sinners , so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous .
teach me to do thy will ; for thou art my god : thy spirit is good ; lead me into the land of uprightness .
for he saith , by the strength of my hand i have done it , and by my wisdom ; for i am prudent : and i have removed the bounds of the people , and have robbed their treasures , and i have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man :
and my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people : and as one gathereth eggs that are left , have i gathered all the earth ; and there was none that moved the wing , or opened the mouth , or peeped .
and of thy mercy cut off mine enemies , and destroy all them that afflict my soul : for i am thy servant .
shall i not , as i have done unto samaria and her idols , so do to jerusalem and her idols ?
quicken me , o lord , for thy name ' s sake : for thy righteousness ' sake bring my soul out of trouble .
wherefore it shall come to pass , that when the lord hath performed his whole work upon mount zion and on jerusalem , i will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of assyria , and the glory of his high looks .
now it came to pass after the death of saul , when david was returned from the slaughter of the amalekites , and david had abode two days in ziklag ;
and moses commanded them , saying , at the end of every seven years , in the solemnity of the year of release , in the feast of tabernacles ,
wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them .
it came even to pass on the third day , that , behold , a man came out of the camp from saul with his clothes rent , and earth upon his head : and so it was , when he came to david , that he fell to the earth , and did obeisance .
gather the people together , men , and women , and children , and thy stranger that is within thy gates , that they may hear , and that they may learn , and fear the lord your god , and observe to do all the words of this law :
when all israel is come to appear before the lord thy god in the place which he shall choose , thou shalt read this law before all israel in their hearing .
and david said unto the young man that told him , how knowest thou that saul and jonathan his son be dead ?
and the lord said unto moses , behold , thy days approach that thou must die : call joshua , and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation , that i may give him a charge . and moses and joshua went , and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation .
and the young man that told him said , as i happened by chance upon mount gilboa , behold , saul leaned upon his spear ; and , lo , the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him .
and that their children , which have not known any thing , may hear , and learn to fear the lord your god , as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over jordan to possess it .
and david said unto him , from whence comest thou ? and he said unto him , out of the camp of israel am i escaped .
and david said unto him , how went the matter ? i pray thee , tell me . and he answered , that the people are fled from the battle , and many of the people also are fallen and dead ; and saul and jonathan his son are dead also .
and the lord appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud : and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle .
and rent the kingdom away from the house of david , and gave it thee : and yet thou hast not been as my servant david , who kept my commandments , and who followed me with all his heart , to do that only which was right in mine eyes ;
but hast done evil above all that were before thee : for thou hast gone and made thee other gods , and molten images , to provoke me to anger , and hast cast me behind thy back :
for he taught them as one having authority , and not as the scribes .
and jeroboam said to his wife , arise , i pray thee , and disguise thyself , that thou be not known to be the wife of jeroboam ; and get thee to shiloh : behold , there is ahijah the prophet , which told me that i should be king over this people .
and the rain descended , and the floods came , and the winds blew , and beat upon that house ; and it fell : and great was the fall of it .
and take with thee ten loaves , and cracknels , and a cruse of honey , and go to him : he shall tell thee what shall become of the child .
and i will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought , in that they are turned unto other gods .
and it came to pass , when jesus had ended these sayings , the people were astonished at his doctrine :
now therefore write ye this song for you , and teach it the children of israel : put it in their mouths , that this song may be a witness for me against the children of israel .
and the rain descended , and the floods came , and the winds blew , and beat upon that house ; and it fell not : for it was founded upon a rock .
at that time abijah the son of jeroboam fell sick .
and every one that heareth these sayings of mine , and doeth them not , shall be likened unto a foolish man , which built his house upon the sand :
and it was so , when ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she came in at the door , that he said , come in , thou wife of jeroboam ; why feignest thou thyself to be another ? for i am sent to thee with heavy tidings .
and then will i profess unto them , i never knew you : depart from me , ye that work iniquity .
go , tell jeroboam , thus saith the lord god of israel , forasmuch as i exalted thee from among the people , and made thee prince over my people israel ,
therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine , and doeth them , i will liken him unto a wise man , which built his house upon a rock :
and jeroboam ' s wife did so , and arose , and went to shiloh , and came to the house of ahijah . but ahijah could not see ; for his eyes were set by reason of his age .
not every one that saith unto me , lord , lord , shall enter into the kingdom of heaven ; but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven .
and the lord said unto ahijah , behold , the wife of jeroboam cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son ; for he is sick : thus and thus shalt thou say unto her : for it shall be , when she cometh in , that she shall feign herself to be another woman .
many will say to me in that day , lord , lord , have we not prophesied in thy name ? and in thy name have cast out devils ? and in thy name done many wonderful works ?
likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the lord in the sabbaths and in the new moons .
and the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the lord in the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish , and a ram without blemish .
and in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish , and six lambs , and a ram : they shall be without blemish .
and when the prince shall enter , he shall go in by the way of the porch of that gate , and he shall go forth by the way thereof .
thus saith the lord god ; the gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days ; but on the sabbath it shall be opened , and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened .
honour thy father and mother ; ( which is the first commandment with promise ; )
children , obey your parents in the lord : for this is right .
and , ye fathers , provoke not your children to wrath : but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the lord .
and moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of israel the words of this song , until they were ended .
that it may be well with thee , and thou mayest live long on the earth .
for i know thy rebellion , and thy stiff neck : behold , while i am yet alive with you this day , ye have been rebellious against the lord ; and how much more after my death ?
take this book of the law , and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the lord your god , that it may be there for a witness against thee .
that moses commanded the levites , which bare the ark of the covenant of the lord , saying ,
and it came to pass , when moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book , until they were finished ,
and he gave joshua the son of nun a charge , and said , be strong and of a good courage : for thou shalt bring the children of israel into the land which i sware unto them : and i will be with thee .
moses therefore wrote this song the same day , and taught it the children of israel .
for when i shall have brought them into the land which i sware unto their fathers , that floweth with milk and honey ; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves , and waxen fat ; then will they turn unto other gods , and serve them , and provoke me , and break my covenant .
a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit , neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit .
every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast into the fire .
or if he ask a fish , will he give him a serpent ?
if ye then , being evil , know how to give good gifts unto your children , how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him ?
therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you , do ye even so to them : for this is the law and the prophets .
enter ye in at the strait gate : for wide is the gate , and broad is the way , that leadeth to destruction , and many there be which go in thereat :
and he said unto me , who art thou ? and i answered him , i am an amalekite .
because strait is the gate , and narrow is the way , which leadeth unto life , and few there be that find it .
and when he looked behind him , he saw me , and called unto me . and i answered , here am i .
beware of false prophets , which come to you in sheep ' s clothing , but inwardly they are ravening wolves .
gather unto me all the elders of your tribes , and your officers , that i may speak these words in their ears , and call heaven and earth to record against them .
ye shall know them by their fruits . do men gather grapes of thorns , or figs of thistles ?
and he said unto me again , stand , i pray thee , upon me , and slay me : for anguish is come upon me , because my life is yet whole in me .
for i know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves , and turn aside from the way which i have commanded you ; and evil will befall you in the latter days ; because ye will do evil in the sight of the lord , to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands .
even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit ; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit .
comfort your hearts , and stablish you in every good word and work .
therefore , brethren , stand fast , and hold the traditions which ye have been taught , whether by word , or our epistle .
now our lord jesus christ himself , and god , even our father , which hath loved us , and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace ,
but we are bound to give thanks alway to god for you , brethren beloved of the lord , because god hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth :
who knowing the judgment of god , that they which commit such things are worthy of death , not only do the same , but have pleasure in them that do them .
whereunto he called you by our gospel , to the obtaining of the glory of our lord jesus christ .
and for this cause god shall send them strong delusion , that they should believe a lie :
backbiters , haters of god , despiteful , proud , boasters , inventors of evil things , disobedient to parents ,
that they all might be damned who believed not the truth , but had pleasure in unrighteousness .
without understanding , covenantbreakers , without natural affection , implacable , unmerciful :
were they ashamed when they had committed abomination ? nay , they were not at all ashamed , neither could they blush : therefore they shall fall among them that fall : at the time that i visit them they shall be cast down , saith the lord .
they have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly , saying , peace , peace ; when there is no peace .
for from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness ; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely .
and their houses shall be turned unto others , with their fields and wives together : for i will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land , saith the lord .
therefore i am full of the fury of the lord ; i am weary with holding in : i will pour it out upon the children abroad , and upon the assembly of young men together : for even the husband with the wife shall be taken , the aged with him that is full of days .
to whom shall i speak , and give warning , that they may hear ? behold , their ear is uncircumcised , and they cannot hearken : behold , the word of the lord is unto them a reproach ; they have no delight in it .
but all the congregation bade stone them with stones . and the glory of the lord appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of israel .
and the lord said unto moses , how long will this people provoke me ? and how long will it be ere they believe me , for all the signs which i have shewed among them ?
knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth , the same shall he receive of the lord , whether he be bond or free .
with good will doing service , as to the lord , and not to men :
now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man , then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak , saying ,
not with eyeservice , as menpleasers ; but as the servants of christ , doing the will of god from the heart ;
i will smite them with the pestilence , and disinherit them , and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they .
servants , be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh , with fear and trembling , in singleness of your heart , as unto christ ;
and moses said unto the lord , then the egyptians shall hear it , ( for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them ; )
the lord is longsuffering , and of great mercy , forgiving iniquity and transgression , and by no means clearing the guilty , visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation .
pardon , i beseech thee , the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy , and as thou hast forgiven this people , from egypt even until now .
because the lord was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them , therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness .
and , ye masters , do the same things unto them , forbearing threatening : knowing that your master also is in heaven ; neither is there respect of persons with him .
every one had four faces apiece , and every one four wings ; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings .
and the likeness of their faces was the same faces which i saw by the river of chebar , their appearances and themselves : they went every one straight forward .
this is the living creature that i saw under the god of israel by the river of chebar ; and i knew that they were the cherubims .
making request , if by any means now at length i might have a prosperous journey by the will of god to come unto you .
for i long to see you , that i may impart unto you some spiritual gift , to the end ye may be established ;
and the lord said , i have pardoned according to thy word :
but as truly as i live , all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the lord .
because all those men which have seen my glory , and my miracles , which i did in egypt and in the wilderness , and have tempted me now these ten times , and have not hearkened to my voice ;
for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men , who hold the truth in unrighteousness ;
because that which may be known of god is manifest in them ; for god hath shewed it unto them .
say unto them , as truly as i live , saith the lord , as ye have spoken in mine ears , so will i do to you :
for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ : for it is the power of god unto salvation to every one that believeth ; to the jew first , and also to the greek .
your carcases shall fall in this wilderness ; and all that were numbered of you , according to your whole number , from twenty years old and upward , which have murmured against me ,
i am debtor both to the greeks , and to the barbarians ; both to the wise , and to the unwise .
surely they shall not see the land which i sware unto their fathers , neither shall any of them that provoked me see it :
but my servant caleb , because he had another spirit with him , and hath followed me fully , him will i bring into the land whereinto he went ; and his seed shall possess it .
that is , that i may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me .
( now the amalekites and the canaanites dwelt in the valley . ) to morrow turn you , and get you into the wilderness by the way of the red sea .
now i would not have you ignorant , brethren , that oftentimes i purposed to come unto you , ( but was let hitherto , ) that i might have some fruit among you also , even as among other gentiles .
and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron , saying ,
and as for their appearances , they four had one likeness , as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel .
when they went , they went upon their four sides ; they turned not as they went , but to the place whither the head looked they followed it ; they turned not as they went .
and their whole body , and their backs , and their hands , and their wings , and the wheels , were full of eyes round about , even the wheels that they four had .
as for the wheels , it was cried unto them in my hearing , o wheel .
then the glory of the lord departed from off the threshold of the house , and stood over the cherubims .
and every one had four faces : the first face was the face of a cherub , and the second face was the face of a man , and the third the face of a lion , and the fourth the face of an eagle .
and the cherubims were lifted up . this is the living creature that i saw by the river of chebar .
and when the cherubims went , the wheels went by them : and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth , the same wheels also turned not from beside them .
when they stood , these stood ; and when they were lifted up , these lifted up themselves also : for the spirit of the living creature was in them .
but as for you , your carcases , they shall fall in this wilderness .
for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen , being understood by the things that are made , even his eternal power and godhead ; so that they are without excuse :
and your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years , and bear your whoredoms , until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness .
because that , when they knew god , they glorified him not as god , neither were thankful ; but became vain in their imaginations , and their foolish heart was darkened .
doubtless ye shall not come into the land , concerning which i sware to make you dwell therein , save caleb the son of jephunneh , and joshua the son of nun .
professing themselves to be wise , they became fools ,
but your little ones , which ye said should be a prey , them will i bring in , and they shall know the land which ye have despised .
and likewise also the men , leaving the natural use of the woman , burned in their lust one toward another ; men with men working that which is unseemly , and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet .
and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge , god gave them over to a reprobate mind , to do those things which are not convenient ;
being filled with all unrighteousness , fornication , wickedness , covetousness , maliciousness ; full of envy , murder , debate , deceit , malignity ; whisperers ,
but joshua the son of nun , and caleb the son of jephunneh , which were of the men that went to search the land , lived still .
and changed the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like to corruptible man , and to birds , and fourfooted beasts , and creeping things .
and the men , which moses sent to search the land , who returned , and made all the congregation to murmur against him , by bringing up a slander upon the land ,
wherefore god also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts , to dishonour their own bodies between themselves :
even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land , died by the plague before the lord .
who changed the truth of god into a lie , and worshipped and served the creature more than the creator , who is blessed for ever . amen .
after the number of the days in which ye searched the land , even forty days , each day for a year , shall ye bear your iniquities , even forty years , and ye shall know my breach of promise .
for this cause god gave them up unto vile affections : for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature :
i the lord have said , i will surely do it unto all this evil congregation , that are gathered together against me : in this wilderness they shall be consumed , and there they shall die .
then the amalekites came down , and the canaanites which dwelt in that hill , and smote them , and discomfited them , even unto hormah .
and many other signs truly did jesus in the presence of his disciples , which are not written in this book :
and they rose up early in the morning , and gat them up into the top of the mountain , saying , lo , we be here , and will go up unto the place which the lord hath promised : for we have sinned .
now when job ' s three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him , they came every one from his own place ; eliphaz the temanite , and bildad the shuhite , and zophar the naamathite : for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him .
but these are written , that ye might believe that jesus is the christ , the son of god ; and that believing ye might have life through his name .
but he said unto her , thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh . what ? shall we receive good at the hand of god , and shall we not receive evil ? in all this did not job sin with his lips .
so they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights , and none spake a word unto him : for they saw that his grief was very great .
and when they lifted up their eyes afar off , and knew him not , they lifted up their voice , and wept ; and they rent every one his mantle , and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven .
but they presumed to go up unto the hill top : nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the lord , and moses , departed not out of the camp .
for the amalekites and the canaanites are there before you , and ye shall fall by the sword : because ye are turned away from the lord , therefore the lord will not be with you .
go not up , for the lord is not among you ; that ye be not smitten before your enemies .
and moses said , wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the lord ? but it shall not prosper .
jesus saith unto him , thomas , because thou hast seen me , thou hast believed : blessed are they that have not seen , and yet have believed .
the other disciples therefore said unto him , we have seen the lord . but he said unto them , except i shall see in his hands the print of the nails , and put my finger into the print of the nails , and thrust my hand into his side , i will not believe .
and after eight days again his disciples were within , and thomas with them : then came jesus , the doors being shut , and stood in the midst , and said , peace be unto you .
then saith he to thomas , reach hither thy finger , and behold my hands ; and reach hither thy hand , and thrust it into my side : and be not faithless , but believing .
and thomas answered and said unto him , my lord and my god .
then said jesus to them again , peace be unto you : as my father hath sent me , even so send i you .
and when he had said this , he breathed on them , and saith unto them , receive ye the holy ghost :
whose soever sins ye remit , they are remitted unto them ; and whose soever sins ye retain , they are retained .
but thomas , one of the twelve , called didymus , was not with them when jesus came .
and when he had so said , he shewed unto them his hands and his side . then were the disciples glad , when they saw the lord .
then the same day at evening , being the first day of the week , when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the jews , came jesus and stood in the midst , and saith unto them , peace be unto you .
mary magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the lord , and that he had spoken these things unto her .
and seeth two angels in white sitting , the one at the head , and the other at the feet , where the body of jesus had lain .
and they say unto her , woman , why weepest thou ? she saith unto them , because they have taken away my lord , and i know not where they have laid him .
then the disciples went away again unto their own home .
but mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping : and as she wept , she stooped down , and looked into the sepulchre ,
jesus saith unto her , mary . she turned herself , and saith unto him , rabboni ; which is to say , master .
jesus saith unto her , touch me not ; for i am not yet ascended to my father : but go to my brethren , and say unto them , i ascend unto my father , and your father ; and to my god , and your god .
and when she had thus said , she turned herself back , and saw jesus standing , and knew not that it was jesus .
jesus saith unto her , woman , why weepest thou ? whom seekest thou ? she , supposing him to be the gardener , saith unto him , sir , if thou have borne him hence , tell me where thou hast laid him , and i will take him away .
but when sanballat the horonite , and tobiah the servant , the ammonite , and geshem the arabian , heard it , they laughed us to scorn , and despised us , and said , what is this thing that ye do ? will ye rebel against the king ?
then i told them of the hand of my god which was good upon me ; as also the king ' s words that he had spoken unto me . and they said , let us rise up and build . so they strengthened their hands for this good work .
but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness , and despise government . presumptuous are they , selfwilled , they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities .
then went i up in the night by the brook , and viewed the wall , and turned back , and entered by the gate of the valley , and so returned .
whereas angels , which are greater in power and might , bring not railing accusation against them before the lord .
then i went on to the gate of the fountain , and to the king ' s pool : but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass .
then said i unto them , ye see the distress that we are in , how jerusalem lieth waste , and the gates thereof are burned with fire : come , and let us build up the wall of jerusalem , that we be no more a reproach .
and the rulers knew not whither i went , or what i did ; neither had i as yet told it to the jews , nor to the priests , nor to the nobles , nor to the rulers , nor to the rest that did the work .
so i came to jerusalem , and was there three days .
when sanballat the horonite , and tobiah the servant , the ammonite , heard of it , it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of israel .
and i went out by night by the gate of the valley , even before the dragon well , and to the dung port , and viewed the walls of jerusalem , which were broken down , and the gates thereof were consumed with fire .
and i arose in the night , i and some few men with me ; neither told i any man what my god had put in my heart to do at jerusalem : neither was there any beast with me , save the beast that i rode upon .
which have forsaken the right way , and are gone astray , following the way of balaam the son of bosor , who loved the wages of unrighteousness ;
having eyes full of adultery , and that cannot cease from sin ; beguiling unstable souls : an heart they have exercised with covetous practices ; cursed children :
and shall receive the reward of unrighteousness , as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time . spots they are and blemishes , sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you ;
but these , as natural brute beasts , made to be taken and destroyed , speak evil of the things that they understand not ; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption ;
while they promise them liberty , they themselves are the servants of corruption : for of whom a man is overcome , of the same is he brought in bondage .
for when they speak great swelling words of vanity , they allure through the lusts of the flesh , through much wantonness , those that were clean escaped from them who live in error .
these are wells without water , clouds that are carried with a tempest ; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever .
but was rebuked for his iniquity : the dumb ass speaking with man ' s voice forbad the madness of the prophet .
for if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the lord and saviour jesus christ , they are again entangled therein , and overcome , the latter end is worse with them than the beginning .
for it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness , than , after they have known it , to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them .
but it is happened unto them according to the true proverb , the dog is turned to his own vomit again ; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire .
discretion shall preserve thee , understanding shall keep thee :
when wisdom entereth into thine heart , and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul ;
who leave the paths of uprightness , to walk in the ways of darkness ;
to deliver thee from the way of the evil man , from the man that speaketh froward things ;
then answered i them , and said unto them , the god of heaven , he will prosper us ; therefore we his servants will arise and build : but ye have no portion , nor right , nor memorial , in jerusalem .
whose ways are crooked , and they froward in their paths :
who rejoice to do evil , and delight in the frowardness of the wicked ;
to deliver thee from the strange woman , even from the stranger which flattereth with her words ;
for her house inclineth unto death , and her paths unto the dead .
none that go unto her return again , neither take they hold of the paths of life .
that thou mayest walk in the way of good men , and keep the paths of the righteous .
now when john had heard in the prison the works of christ , he sent two of his disciples ,
and it came to pass , when jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples , he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities .
but the wicked shall be cut off from the earth , and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it .
for the upright shall dwell in the land , and the perfect shall remain in it .
but what went ye out for to see ? a prophet ? yea , i say unto you , and more than a prophet .
but what went ye out for to see ? a man clothed in soft raiment ? behold , they that wear soft clothing are in kings ' houses .
the blind receive their sight , and the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , and the deaf hear , the dead are raised up , and the poor have the gospel preached to them .
jesus answered and said unto them , go and shew john again those things which ye do hear and see :
and as they departed , jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning john , what went ye out into the wilderness to see ? a reed shaken with the wind ?
and blessed is he , whosoever shall not be offended in me .
when they therefore were come together , they asked of him , saying , lord , wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to israel ?
for john truly baptized with water ; but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence .
but ye shall receive power , after that the holy ghost is come upon you : and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem , and in all judaea , and in samaria , and unto the uttermost part of the earth .
provide neither gold , nor silver , nor brass in your purses ,
and he said unto them , it is not for you to know the times or the seasons , which the father hath put in his own power .
and as ye go , preach , saying , the kingdom of heaven is at hand .
and when he had spoken these things , while they beheld , he was taken up ; and a cloud received him out of their sight .
heal the sick , cleanse the lepers , raise the dead , cast out devils : freely ye have received , freely give .
these twelve jesus sent forth , and commanded them , saying , go not into the way of the gentiles , and into any city of the samaritans enter ye not :
but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of israel .
the former treatise have i made , o theophilus , of all that jesus began both to do and teach ,
until the day in which he was taken up , after that he through the holy ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen :
to whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs , being seen of them forty days , and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of god :
and , being assembled together with them , commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem , but wait for the promise of the father , which , saith he , ye have heard of me .
and as i was considering , behold , an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth , and touched not the ground : and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes .
and he came to the ram that had two horns , which i had there seen standing before the river , and ran unto him in the fury of his power .
then i lifted up mine eyes , and saw , and , behold , there stood before the river a ram which had two horns : and the two horns were high ; but one was higher than the other , and the higher came up last .
speak unto the children of israel , and say unto them , when ye be come into the land which i give unto you , and shall reap the harvest thereof , then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest :
i saw the ram pushing westward , and northward , and southward ; so that no beasts might stand before him , neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand ; but he did according to his will , and became great .
in the third year of the reign of king belshazzar a vision appeared unto me , even unto me daniel , after that which appeared unto me at the first .
and i saw in a vision ; and it came to pass , when i saw , that i was at shushan in the palace , which is in the province of elam ; and i saw in a vision , and i was by the river of ulai .
for thus saith the lord of hosts , the god of israel ; let not your prophets and your diviners , that be in the midst of you , deceive you , neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed .
for they prophesy falsely unto you in my name : i have not sent them , saith the lord .
take ye wives , and beget sons and daughters ; and take wives for your sons , and give your daughters to husbands , that they may bear sons and daughters ; that ye may be increased there , and not diminished .
and out of one of them came forth a little horn , which waxed exceeding great , toward the south , and toward the east , and toward the pleasant land .
and seek the peace of the city whither i have caused you to be carried away captives , and pray unto the lord for it : for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace .
thus saith the lord of hosts , the god of israel , unto all that are carried away captives , whom i have caused to be carried away from jerusalem unto babylon ;
build ye houses , and dwell in them ; and plant gardens , and eat the fruit of them ;
therefore the he goat waxed very great : and when he was strong , the great horn was broken ; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven .
by the hand of elasah the son of shaphan , and gemariah the son of hilkiah , ( whom zedekiah king of judah sent unto babylon to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon ) saying ,
now the names of the twelve apostles are these ; the first , simon , who is called peter , and andrew his brother ; james the son of zebedee , and john his brother ;
( after that jeconiah the king , and the queen , and the eunuchs , the princes of judah and jerusalem , and the carpenters , and the smiths , were departed from jerusalem ; )
and when he had called unto him his twelve disciples , he gave them power against unclean spirits , to cast them out , and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease .
now these are the words of the letter that jeremiah the prophet sent from jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were carried away captives , and to the priests , and to the prophets , and to all the people whom nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from jerusalem to babylon ;
simon the canaanite , and judas iscariot , who also betrayed him .
philip , and bartholomew ; thomas , and matthew the publican ; james the son of alphaeus , and lebbaeus , whose surname was thaddaeus ;
then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering , and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings .
even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days ; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the lord .
and ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath , from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering ; seven sabbaths shall be complete :
and ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year , and one young bullock , and two rams : they shall be for a burnt offering unto the lord , with their meat offering , and their drink offerings , even an offering made by fire , of sweet savour unto the lord .
ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals : they shall be of fine flour ; they shall be baken with leaven ; they are the firstfruits unto the lord .
and ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the lord .
and he shall wave the sheaf before the lord , to be accepted for you : on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it .
and ye shall eat neither bread , nor parched corn , nor green ears , until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your god : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings .
and the meat offering thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine flour mingled with oil , an offering made by fire unto the lord for a sweet savour : and the drink offering thereof shall be of wine , the fourth part of an hin .
and the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits for a wave offering before the lord , with the two lambs : they shall be holy to the lord for the priest .
and ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day , that it may be an holy convocation unto you : ye shall do no servile work therein : it shall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations .
ye shall do no servile work therein : but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the lord .
speak unto the children of israel , saying , in the seventh month , in the first day of the month , shall ye have a sabbath , a memorial of blowing of trumpets , an holy convocation .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
and when ye reap the harvest of your land , thou shalt not make clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest , neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest : thou shalt leave them unto the poor , and to the stranger : i am the lord your god .
for whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day , he shall be cut off from among his people .
and ye shall do no work in that same day : for it is a day of atonement , to make an atonement for you before the lord your god .
also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement : it shall be an holy convocation unto you ; and ye shall afflict your souls , and offer an offering made by fire unto the lord .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
and whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same day , the same soul will i destroy from among his people .
ye shall do no manner of work : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings .
it shall be unto you a sabbath of rest , and ye shall afflict your souls : in the ninth day of the month at even , from even unto even , shall ye celebrate your sabbath .
and these were their names : of the tribe of reuben , shammua the son of zaccur .
of the tribe of simeon , shaphat the son of hori .
of the tribe of judah , caleb the son of jephunneh .
of the tribe of issachar , igal the son of joseph .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
send thou men , that they may search the land of canaan , which i give unto the children of israel : of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man , every one a ruler among them .
and moses by the commandment of the lord sent them from the wilderness of paran : all those men were heads of the children of israel .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the lord : on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you ; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the lord : it is a solemn assembly ; and ye shall do no servile work therein .
on the first day shall be an holy convocation : ye shall do no servile work therein .
beside the sabbaths of the lord , and beside your gifts , and beside all your vows , and beside all your freewill offerings , which ye give unto the lord .
these are the feasts of the lord , which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations , to offer an offering made by fire unto the lord , a burnt offering , and a meat offering , a sacrifice , and drink offerings , every thing upon his day :
also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month , when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land , ye shall keep a feast unto the lord seven days : on the first day shall be a sabbath , and on the eighth day shall be a sabbath .
i will declare thy righteousness , and thy works ; for they shall not profit thee .
when thou criest , let thy companies deliver thee ; but the wind shall carry them all away ; vanity shall take them : but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land , and shall inherit my holy mountain ;
thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way ; yet saidst thou not , there is no hope : thou hast found the life of thine hand ; therefore thou wast not grieved .
and of whom hast thou been afraid or feared , that thou hast lied , and hast not remembered me , nor laid it to thy heart ? have not i held my peace even of old , and thou fearest me not ?
for i will not contend for ever , neither will i be always wroth : for the spirit should fail before me , and the souls which i have made .
for the iniquity of his covetousness was i wroth , and smote him : i hid me , and was wroth , and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart .
and shall say , cast ye up , cast ye up , prepare the way , take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people .
for thus saith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity , whose name is holy ; i dwell in the high and holy place , with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit , to revive the spirit of the humble , and to revive the heart of the contrite ones .
that your generations may know that i made the children of israel to dwell in booths , when i brought them out of the land of egypt : i am the lord your god .
ye shall dwell in booths seven days ; all that are israelites born shall dwell in booths :
and ye shall keep it a feast unto the lord seven days in the year . it shall be a statute for ever in your generations : ye shall celebrate it in the seventh month .
and ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees , branches of palm trees , and the boughs of thick trees , and willows of the brook ; and ye shall rejoice before the lord your god seven days .
and moses declared unto the children of israel the feasts of the lord .
i create the fruit of the lips ; peace , peace to him that is far off , and to him that is near , saith the lord ; and i will heal him .
there is no peace , saith my god , to the wicked .
but the wicked are like the troubled sea , when it cannot rest , whose waters cast up mire and dirt .
serve the lord with fear , and rejoice with trembling .
kiss the son , lest he be angry , and ye perish from the way , when his wrath is kindled but a little . blessed are all they that put their trust in him .
be wise now therefore , o ye kings : be instructed , ye judges of the earth .
i am for peace : but when i speak , they are for war .
woe is me , that i sojourn in mesech , that i dwell in the tents of kedar !
my soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace .
what shall be given unto thee ? or what shall be done unto thee , thou false tongue ?
sharp arrows of the mighty , with coals of juniper .
in my distress i cried unto the lord , and he heard me .
deliver my soul , o lord , from lying lips , and from a deceitful tongue .
defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit , wherein i dwell : for i the lord dwell among the children of israel .
so ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are : for blood it defileth the land : and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein , but by the blood of him that shed it .
and ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge , that he should come again to dwell in the land , until the death of the priest .
moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer , which is guilty of death : but he shall be surely put to death .
or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood , wherewith he may die , and he die , he is a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
and if he smite him with throwing a stone , wherewith he may die , and he die , he is a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
and if he smite him with an instrument of iron , so that he die , he is a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
these six cities shall be a refuge , both for the children of israel , and for the stranger , and for the sojourner among them : that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither .
ye shall give three cities on this side jordan , and three cities shall ye give in the land of canaan , which shall be cities of refuge .
and of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye have for refuge .
and they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger ; that the manslayer die not , until he stand before the congregation in judgment .
then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you ; that the slayer may flee thither , which killeth any person at unawares .
but if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge , whither he was fled ;
so these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings .
because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest : but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession .
or with any stone , wherewith a man may die , seeing him not , and cast it upon him , that he die , and was not his enemy , neither sought his harm :
but if he thrust him suddenly without enmity , or have cast upon him any thing without laying of wait ,
and the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood , and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge , whither he was fled : and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest , which was anointed with the holy oil .
then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of blood according to these judgments :
or in enmity smite him with his hand , that he die : he that smote him shall surely be put to death ; for he is a murderer : the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer , when he meeteth him .
but if he thrust him of hatred , or hurl at him by laying of wait , that he die ;
the revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer : when he meeteth him , he shall slay him .
the god of abraham , and of isaac , and of jacob , the god of our fathers , hath glorified his son jesus ; whom ye delivered up , and denied him in the presence of pilate , when he was determined to let him go .
and when peter saw it , he answered unto the people , ye men of israel , why marvel ye at this ? or why look ye so earnestly on us , as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk ?
and killed the prince of life , whom god hath raised from the dead ; whereof we are witnesses .
but ye denied the holy one and the just , and desired a murderer to be granted unto you ;
and as the lame man which was healed held peter and john , all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called solomon ' s , greatly wondering .
and they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the beautiful gate of the temple : and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him .
and now , brethren , i wot that through ignorance ye did it , as did also your rulers .
and his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong , whom ye see and know : yea , the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all .
repent ye therefore , and be converted , that your sins may be blotted out , when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord ;
but those things , which god before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets , that christ should suffer , he hath so fulfilled .
of the tribe of ephraim , oshea the son of nun .
of the tribe of benjamin , palti the son of raphu .
unto you first god , having raised up his son jesus , sent him to bless you , in turning away every one of you from his iniquities .
ye are the children of the prophets , and of the covenant which god made with our fathers , saying unto abraham , and in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed .
yea , and all the prophets from samuel and those that follow after , as many as have spoken , have likewise foretold of these days .
and it shall come to pass , that every soul , which will not hear that prophet , shall be destroyed from among the people .
for moses truly said unto the fathers , a prophet shall the lord your god raise up unto you of your brethren , like unto me ; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you .
and he shall send jesus christ , which before was preached unto you :
his eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters , washed with milk , and fitly set .
his cheeks are as a bed of spices , as sweet flowers : his lips like lilies , dropping sweet smelling myrrh .
my beloved is white and ruddy , the chiefest among ten thousand .
his head is as the most fine gold , his locks are bushy , and black as a raven .
his mouth is most sweet : yea , he is altogether lovely . this is my beloved , and this is my friend , o daughters of jerusalem .
his hands are as gold rings set with the beryl : his belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires .
his legs are as pillars of marble , set upon sockets of fine gold : his countenance is as lebanon , excellent as the cedars .
and thou shalt give the levites unto aaron and to his sons : they are wholly given unto him out of the children of israel .
and they shall keep his charge , and the charge of the whole congregation before the tabernacle of the congregation , to do the service of the tabernacle .
and they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of the congregation , and the charge of the children of israel , to do the service of the tabernacle .
these also are the generations of aaron and moses in the day that the lord spake with moses in mount sinai .
and these are the names of the sons of aaron ; nadab the firstborn , and abihu , eleazar , and ithamar .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
and nadab and abihu died before the lord , when they offered strange fire before the lord , in the wilderness of sinai , and they had no children : and eleazar and ithamar ministered in the priest ' s office in the sight of aaron their father .
and the king said , what have i to do with you , ye sons of zeruiah ? so let him curse , because the lord hath said unto him , curse david . who shall then say , wherefore hast thou done so ?
and david said to abishai , and to all his servants , behold , my son , which came forth of my bowels , seeketh my life : how much more now may this benjamite do it ? let him alone , and let him curse ; for the lord hath bidden him .
because david did that which was right in the eyes of the lord , and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life , save only in the matter of uriah the hittite .
and absalom , and all the people the men of israel , came to jerusalem , and ahithophel with him .
and there was war between rehoboam and jeroboam all the days of his life .
and the king , and all the people that were with him , came weary , and refreshed themselves there .
and he walked in all the sins of his father , which he had done before him : and his heart was not perfect with the lord his god , as the heart of david his father .
and as david and his men went by the way , shimei went along on the hill ' s side over against him , and cursed as he went , and threw stones at him , and cast dust .
nevertheless for david ' s sake did the lord his god give him a lamp in jerusalem , to set up his son after him , and to establish jerusalem :
it may be that the lord will look on mine affliction , and that the lord will requite me good for his cursing this day .
now in the eighteenth year of king jeroboam the son of nebat reigned abijam over judah .
three years reigned he in jerusalem . and his mother ' s name was maachah , the daughter of abishalom .
and hushai said unto absalom , nay ; but whom the lord , and this people , and all the men of israel , choose , his will i be , and with him will i abide .
and absalom said to hushai , is this thy kindness to thy friend ? why wentest thou not with thy friend ?
and it came to pass , when hushai the archite , david ' s friend , was come unto absalom , that hushai said unto absalom , god save the king , god save the king .
and in the twentieth year of jeroboam king of israel reigned asa over judah .
now the rest of the acts of abijam , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah ? and there was war between abijam and jeroboam .
and abijam slept with his fathers ; and they buried him in the city of david : and asa his son reigned in his stead .
then said absalom to ahithophel , give counsel among you what we shall do .
and ahithophel said unto absalom , go in unto thy father ' s concubines , which he hath left to keep the house ; and all israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father : then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong .
so they spread absalom a tent upon the top of the house ; and absalom went in unto his father ' s concubines in the sight of all israel .
and the counsel of ahithophel , which he counselled in those days , was as if a man had inquired at the oracle of god : so was all the counsel of ahithophel both with david and with absalom .
and after him was shamgar the son of anath , which slew of the philistines six hundred men with an ox goad : and he also delivered israel .
so moab was subdued that day under the hand of israel . and the land had rest fourscore years .
and he saith unto them , are ye so without understanding also ? do ye not perceive , that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man , it cannot defile him ;
because it entereth not into his heart , but into the belly , and goeth out into the draught , purging all meats ?
if any man have ears to hear , let him hear .
and when he was entered into the house from the people , his disciples asked him concerning the parable .
for moses said , honour thy father and thy mother ; and , whoso curseth father or mother , let him die the death :
but ye say , if a man shall say to his father or mother , it is corban , that is to say , a gift , by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me ; he shall be free .
and when he had called all the people unto him , he said unto them , hearken unto me every one of you , and understand :
there is nothing from without a man , that entering into him can defile him : but the things which come out of him , those are they that defile the man .
and ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother ;
therefore now let your hands be strengthened , and be ye valiant : for your master saul is dead , and also the house of judah have anointed me king over them .
and now the lord shew kindness and truth unto you : and i also will requite you this kindness , because ye have done this thing .
and made him king over gilead , and over the ashurites , and over jezreel , and over ephraim , and over benjamin , and over all israel .
( for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth ; )
for ye were sometimes darkness , but now are ye light in the lord : walk as children of light :
be not ye therefore partakers with them .
let no man deceive you with vain words : for because of these things cometh the wrath of god upon the children of disobedience .
which sometime were disobedient , when once the longsuffering of god waited in the days of noah , while the ark was a preparing , wherein few , that is , eight souls were saved by water .
who is gone into heaven , and is on the right hand of god ; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him .
be ye therefore followers of god , as dear children ;
and walk in love , as christ also hath loved us , and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to god for a sweetsmelling savour .
neither filthiness , nor foolish talking , nor jesting , which are not convenient : but rather giving of thanks .
for this ye know , that no whoremonger , nor unclean person , nor covetous man , who is an idolater , hath any inheritance in the kingdom of christ and of god .
for he that will love life , and see good days , let him refrain his tongue from evil , and his lips that they speak no guile :
for christ also hath once suffered for sins , the just for the unjust , that he might bring us to god , being put to death in the flesh , but quickened by the spirit :
by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison ;
having a good conscience ; that , whereas they speak evil of you , as of evildoers , they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in christ .
for it is better , if the will of god be so , that ye suffer for well doing , than for evil doing .
but and if ye suffer for righteousness ' sake , happy are ye : and be not afraid of their terror , neither be troubled ;
but sanctify the lord god in your hearts : and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear :
for the eyes of the lord are over the righteous , and his ears are open unto their prayers : but the face of the lord is against them that do evil .
and who is he that will harm you , if ye be followers of that which is good ?
moab is confounded ; for it is broken down : howl and cry ; and tell ye it in arnon , that moab is spoiled ,
and judgment is come upon the plain country ; upon holon , and upon jahazah , and upon mephaath ,
and upon dibon , and upon nebo , and upon beth - diblathaim ,
and upon kiriathaim , and upon beth - gamul , and upon beth - meon ,
and upon kerioth , and upon bozrah , and upon all the cities of the land of moab , far or near .
the horn of moab is cut off , and his arm is broken , saith the lord .
o ye that dwell in moab , leave the cities , and dwell in the rock , and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides of the hole ' s mouth .
we have heard the pride of moab , ( he is exceeding proud ) his loftiness , and his arrogancy , and his pride , and the haughtiness of his heart .
except the lord of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant , we should have been as sodom , and we should have been like unto gomorrah .
and the daughter of zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard , as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers , as a besieged city .
the vision of isaiah the son of amoz , which he saw concerning judah and jerusalem in the days of uzziah , jotham , ahaz , and hezekiah , kings of judah .
the ox knoweth his owner , and the ass his master ' s crib : but israel doth not know , my people doth not consider .
hear , o heavens , and give ear , o earth : for the lord hath spoken , i have nourished and brought up children , and they have rebelled against me .
why should ye be stricken any more ? ye will revolt more and more : the whole head is sick , and the whole heart faint .
ah sinful nation , a people laden with iniquity , a seed of evildoers , children that are corrupters : they have forsaken the lord , they have provoked the holy one of israel unto anger , they are gone away backward .
your country is desolate , your cities are burned with fire : your land , strangers devour it in your presence , and it is desolate , as overthrown by strangers .
from the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it ; but wounds , and bruises , and putrifying sores : they have not been closed , neither bound up , neither mollified with ointment .
cursed be he that doeth the work of the lord deceitfully , and cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood .
moab hath been at ease from his youth , and he hath settled on his lees , and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel , neither hath he gone into captivity : therefore his taste remained in him , and his scent is not changed .
how say ye , we are mighty and strong men for the war ?
moab is spoiled , and gone up out of her cities , and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter , saith the king , whose name is the lord of hosts .
therefore , behold , the days come , saith the lord , that i will send unto him wanderers , that shall cause him to wander , and shall empty his vessels , and break their bottles .
and moab shall be ashamed of chemosh , as the house of israel was ashamed of bethel their confidence .
thou daughter that dost inhabit dibon , come down from thy glory , and sit in thirst ; for the spoiler of moab shall come upon thee , and he shall destroy thy strong holds .
o inhabitant of aroer , stand by the way , and espy ; ask him that fleeth , and her that escapeth , and say , what is done ?
the calamity of moab is near to come , and his affliction hasteth fast .
all ye that are about him , bemoan him ; and all ye that know his name , say , how is the strong staff broken , and the beautiful rod !
i hate them with perfect hatred : i count them mine enemies .
kerioth is taken , and the strong holds are surprised , and the mighty men ' s hearts in moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs .
and there came a certain poor widow , and she threw in two mites , which make a farthing .
do not i hate them , o lord , that hate thee ? and am not i grieved with those that rise up against thee ?
and moab shall be destroyed from being a people , because he hath magnified himself against the lord .
for they speak against thee wickedly , and thine enemies take thy name in vain .
fear , and the pit , and the snare , shall be upon thee , o inhabitant of moab , saith the lord .
which devour widows ' houses , and for a pretence make long prayers : these shall receive greater damnation .
he that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit ; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare : for i will bring upon it , even upon moab , the year of their visitation , saith the lord .
behold , these are the ungodly , who prosper in the world ; they increase in riches .
and they say , how doth god know ? and is there knowledge in the most high ?
therefore his people return hither : and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them .
and see if there be any wicked way in me , and lead me in the way everlasting .
search me , o god , and know my heart : try me , and know my thoughts :
for thus saith the lord ; behold , he shall fly as an eagle , and shall spread his wings over moab .
when i thought to know this , it was too painful for me ;
if i say , i will speak thus ; behold , i should offend against the generation of thy children .
for all the day long have i been plagued , and chastened every morning .
verily i have cleansed my heart in vain , and washed my hands in innocency .
they that fled stood under the shadow of heshbon because of the force : but a fire shall come forth out of heshbon , and a flame from the midst of sihon , and shall devour the corner of moab , and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones .
woe be unto thee , o moab ! the people of chemosh perisheth : for thy sons are taken captives , and thy daughters captives .
surely thou didst set them in slippery places : thou castedst them down into destruction .
yet will i bring again the captivity of moab in the latter days , saith the lord . thus far is the judgment of moab .
until i went into the sanctuary of god ; then understood i their end .
for all they did cast in of their abundance ; but she of her want did cast in all that she had , even all her living .
and he called unto him his disciples , and saith unto them , verily i say unto you , that this poor widow hath cast more in , than all they which have cast into the treasury :
o vine of sibmah , i will weep for thee with the weeping of jazer : thy plants are gone over the sea , they reach even to the sea of jazer : the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage .
and joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field , and from the land of moab ; and i have caused wine to fail from the winepresses : none shall tread with shouting ; their shouting shall be no shouting .
i know his wrath , saith the lord ; but it shall not be so ; his lies shall not so effect it .
and the second is like , namely this , thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself . there is none other commandment greater than these .
therefore will i howl for moab , and i will cry out for all moab ; mine heart shall mourn for the men of kir - heres .
thus my heart was grieved , and i was pricked in my reins .
as a dream when one awaketh ; so , o lord , when thou awakest , thou shalt despise their image .
nevertheless i am continually with thee : thou hast holden me by my right hand .
so foolish was i , and ignorant : i was as a beast before thee .
whom have i in heaven but thee ? and there is none upon earth that i desire beside thee .
for , lo , they that are far from thee shall perish : thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee .
there shall be lamentation generally upon all the housetops of moab , and in the streets thereof : for i have broken moab like a vessel wherein is no pleasure , saith the lord .
my flesh and my heart faileth : but god is the strength of my heart , and my portion for ever .
they shall howl , saying , how is it broken down ! how hath moab turned the back with shame ! so shall moab be a derision and a dismaying to all them about him .
therefore mine heart shall sound for moab like pipes , and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of kir - heres : because the riches that he hath gotten are perished .
but it is good for me to draw near to god : i have put my trust in the lord god , that i may declare all thy works .
for every head shall be bald , and every beard clipped : upon all the hands shall be cuttings , and upon the loins sackcloth .
from the cry of heshbon even unto elealeh , and even unto jahaz , have they uttered their voice , from zoar even unto horonaim , as an heifer of three years old : for the waters also of nimrim shall be desolate .
moreover i will cause to cease in moab , saith the lord , him that offereth in the high places , and him that burneth incense to his gods .
david therefore himself calleth him lord ; and whence is he then his son ? and the common people heard him gladly .
for david himself said by the holy ghost , the lord said to my lord , sit thou on my right hand , till i make thine enemies thy footstool .
and the chief seats in the synagogues , and the uppermost rooms at feasts :
and he said unto them in his doctrine , beware of the scribes , which love to go in long clothing , and love salutations in the marketplaces ,
and to love him with all the heart , and with all the understanding , and with all the soul , and with all the strength , and to love his neighbour as himself , is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices .
and the scribe said unto him , well , master , thou hast said the truth : for there is one god ; and there is none other but he :
and jesus answered and said , while he taught in the temple , how say the scribes that christ is the son of david ?
and when jesus saw that he answered discreetly , he said unto him , thou art not far from the kingdom of god . and no man after that durst ask him any question .
but he himself turned again from the quarries that were by gilgal , and said , i have a secret errand unto thee , o king : who said , keep silence . and all that stood by him went out from him .
they of persia and of lud and of phut were in thine army , thy men of war : they hanged the shield and helmet in thee ; they set forth thy comeliness .
the men of arvad with thine army were upon thy walls round about , and the gammadims were in thy towers : they hanged their shields upon thy walls round about ; they have made thy beauty perfect .
the king ' s favour is toward a wise servant : but his wrath is against him that causeth shame .
and his men that were with him did david bring up , every man with his household : and they dwelt in the cities of hebron .
so david went up thither , and his two wives also , ahinoam the jezreelitess , and abigail nabal ' s wife the carmelite .
and david sent messengers unto the men of jabesh - gilead , and said unto them , blessed be ye of the lord , that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord , even unto saul , and have buried him .
and the men of judah came , and there they anointed david king over the house of judah . and they told david , saying , that the men of jabesh - gilead were they that buried saul .
and it came to pass after this , that david inquired of the lord , saying , shall i go up into any of the cities of judah ? and the lord said unto him , go up . and david said , whither shall i go up ? and he said , unto hebron .
and the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the lord : and the lord strengthened eglon the king of moab against israel , because they had done evil in the sight of the lord .
and the land had rest forty years . and othniel the son of kenaz died .
so the children of israel served eglon the king of moab eighteen years .
and he gathered unto him the children of ammon and amalek , and went and smote israel , and possessed the city of palm trees .
but ehud made him a dagger which had two edges , of a cubit length ; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh .
but when the children of israel cried unto the lord , the lord raised them up a deliverer , ehud the son of gera , a benjamite , a man lefthanded : and by him the children of israel sent a present unto eglon the king of moab .
and when he had made an end to offer the present , he sent away the people that bare the present .
and he brought the present unto eglon king of moab : and eglon was a very fat man .
and the lord sent thee on a journey , and said , go and utterly destroy the sinners the amalekites , and fight against them until they be consumed .
in the multitude of people is the king ' s honour : but in the want of people is the destruction of the prince .
wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the lord , but didst fly upon the spoil , and didst evil in the sight of the lord ?
he that is slow to wrath is of great understanding : but he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly .
dedan was thy merchant in precious clothes for chariots .
then samuel said unto saul , stay , and i will tell thee what the lord hath said to me this night . and he said unto him , say on .
arabia , and all the princes of kedar , they occupied with thee in lambs , and rams , and goats : in these were they thy merchants .
and samuel said , when thou wast little in thine own sight , wast thou not made the head of the tribes of israel , and the lord anointed thee king over israel ?
the merchants of sheba and raamah , they were thy merchants : they occupied in thy fairs with chief of all spices , and with all precious stones , and gold .
and samuel said , what meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears , and the lowing of the oxen which i hear ?
thine eyes did see my substance , yet being unperfect ; and in thy book all my members were written , which in continuance were fashioned , when as yet there was none of them .
the crown of the wise is their riches : but the foolishness of fools is folly .
and saul said , they have brought them from the amalekites : for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen , to sacrifice unto the lord thy god ; and the rest we have utterly destroyed .
how precious also are thy thoughts unto me , o god ! how great is the sum of them !
a true witness delivereth souls : but a deceitful witness speaketh lies .
and when samuel rose early to meet saul in the morning , it was told samuel , saying , saul came to carmel , and , behold , he set him up a place , and is gone about , and passed on , and gone down to gilgal .
if i should count them , they are more in number than the sand : when i awake , i am still with thee .
in the fear of the lord is strong confidence : and his children shall have a place of refuge .
and samuel came to saul : and saul said unto him , blessed be thou of the lord : i have performed the commandment of the lord .
surely thou wilt slay the wicked , o god : depart from me therefore , ye bloody men .
the fear of the lord is a fountain of life , to depart from the snares of death .
yea , the darkness hideth not from thee ; but the night shineth as the day : the darkness and the light are both alike to thee .
for thou hast possessed my reins : thou hast covered me in my mother ' s womb .
and the days which jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years : and he slept with this fathers , and nadab his son reigned in his stead .
i will praise thee ; for i am fearfully and wonderfully made : marvellous are thy works ; and that my soul knoweth right well .
my substance was not hid from thee , when i was made in secret , and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth .
even there shall thy hand lead me , and thy right hand shall hold me .
if i say , surely the darkness shall cover me ; even the night shall be light about me .
for the lord shall smite israel , as a reed is shaken in the water , and he shall root up israel out of this good land , which he gave to their fathers , and shall scatter them beyond the river , because they have made their groves , provoking the lord to anger .
and they buried him ; and all israel mourned for him , according to the word of the lord , which he spake by the hand of his servant ahijah the prophet .
and jeroboam ' s wife arose , and departed , and came to tirzah : and when she came to the threshold of the door , the child died ;
arise thou therefore , get thee to thine own house : and when thy feet enter into the city , the child shall die .
and ehud put forth his left hand , and took the dagger from his right thigh , and thrust it into his belly :
him that dieth of jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat ; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat : for the lord hath spoken it .
and ehud came unto him ; and he was sitting in a summer parlour , which he had for himself alone . and ehud said , i have a message from god unto thee . and he arose out of his seat .
moreover the lord shall raise him up a king over israel , who shall cut off the house of jeroboam that day : but what ? even now .
and all israel shall mourn for him , and bury him : for he only of jeroboam shall come to the grave , because in him there is found some good thing toward the lord god of israel in the house of jeroboam .
it repenteth me that i have set up saul to be king : for he is turned back from following me , and hath not performed my commandments . and it grieved samuel ; and he cried unto the lord all night .
and they tarried till they were ashamed : and , behold , he opened not the doors of the parlour ; therefore they took a key , and opened them : and , behold , their lord was fallen down dead on the earth .
the wicked is driven away in his wickedness : but the righteous hath hope in his death .
judah , and the land of israel , they were thy merchants : they traded in thy market wheat of minnith , and pannag , and honey , and oil , and balm .
then came the word of the lord unto samuel , saying ,
when he was gone out , his servants came ; and when they saw that , behold , the doors of the parlour were locked , they said , surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber .
he that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his maker : but he that honoureth him hath mercy on the poor .
syria was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of thy making : they occupied in thy fairs with emeralds , purple , and broidered work , and fine linen , and coral , and agate .
thus saith the lord god ; let it suffice you , o princes of israel : remove violence and spoil , and execute judgment and justice , take away your exactions from my people , saith the lord god .
then ehud went forth through the porch , and shut the doors of the parlour upon him , and locked them .
righteousness exalteth a nation : but sin is a reproach to any people .
dan also and javan going to and fro occupied in thy fairs : bright iron , cassia , and calamus , were in thy market .
in the land shall be his possession in israel : and my princes shall no more oppress my people ; and the rest of the land shall they give to the house of israel according to their tribes .
wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding : but that which is in the midst of fools is made known .
damascus was thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy making , for the multitude of all riches ; in the wine of helbon , and white wool .
and they slew of moab at that time about ten thousand men , all lusty , and all men of valour ; and there escaped not a man .
javan , tubal , and meshech , they were thy merchants : they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in thy market .
and ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad , and five and twenty thousand long , over against the oblation of the holy portion : it shall be for the whole house of israel .
and the rest of the acts of jeroboam , how he warred , and how he reigned , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel .

and it came to pass , when he was come , that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of ephraim , and the children of israel went down with him from the mount , and he before them .
a sound heart is the life of the flesh : but envy the rottenness of the bones .
the men of dedan were thy merchants ; many isles were the merchandise of thine hand : they brought thee for a present horns of ivory and ebony .
the holy portion of the land shall be for the priests the ministers of the sanctuary , which shall come near to minister unto the lord : and it shall be a place for their houses , and an holy place for the sanctuary .
and ehud escaped while they tarried , and passed beyond the quarries , and escaped unto seirath .
they of the house of togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses and horsemen and mules .
and of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and twenty thousand , and the breadth of ten thousand : and in it shall be the sanctuary and the most holy place .
for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft , and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry . because thou hast rejected the word of the lord , he hath also rejected thee from being king .
the simple believeth every word : but the prudent man looketh well to his going .
and saul said unto samuel , i have sinned : for i have transgressed the commandment of the lord , and thy words : because i feared the people , and obeyed their voice .
now therefore , i pray thee , pardon my sin , and turn again with me , that i may worship the lord .
even in laughter the heart is sorrowful ; and the end of that mirth is heaviness .
and samuel said unto saul , i will not return with thee : for thou hast rejected the word of the lord , and the lord hath rejected thee from being king over israel .
the backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways : and a good man shall be satisfied from himself .
and as samuel turned about to go away , he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle , and it rent .
the evil bow before the good ; and the wicked at the gates of the righteous .
and in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee , and lament over thee , saying , what city is like tyrus , like the destroyed in the midst of the sea ?
at that time jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn ; and his disciples were an hungred , and began to pluck the ears of corn , and to eat .
and samuel said unto him , the lord hath rent the kingdom of israel from thee this day , and hath given it to a neighbour of thine , that is better than thou .
when thy wares went forth out of the seas , thou filledst many people ; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise .
but when the pharisees saw it , they said unto him , behold , thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day .
and also the strength of israel will not lie nor repent : for he is not a man , that he should repent .
he that is soon angry dealeth foolishly : and a man of wicked devices is hated .
and shall cause their voice to be heard against thee , and shall cry bitterly , and shall cast up dust upon their heads , they shall wallow themselves in the ashes :
the simple inherit folly : but the prudent are crowned with knowledge .
and they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee , and gird them with sackcloth , and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of heart and bitter wailing .
thy rowers have brought thee into great waters : the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the seas .
the ships of tarshish did sing of thee in thy market : and thou wast replenished , and made very glorious in the midst of the seas .
these were thy merchants in all sorts of things , in blue clothes , and broidered work , and in chests of rich apparel , bound with cords , and made of cedar , among thy merchandise .
haran , and canneh , and eden , the merchants of sheba , assur , and chilmad , were thy merchants .
and saul said unto samuel , yea , i have obeyed the voice of the lord , and have gone the way which the lord sent me , and have brought agag the king of amalek , and have utterly destroyed the amalekites .
in all labour there is profit : but the talk of the lips tendeth only to penury .
do they not err that devise evil ? but mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good .
and all that handle the oar , the mariners , and all the pilots of the sea , shall come down from their ships , they shall stand upon the land ;
and samuel said , hath the lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices , as in obeying the voice of the lord ? behold , to obey is better than sacrifice , and to hearken than the fat of rams .
he that despiseth his neighbour sinneth : but he that hath mercy on the poor , happy is he .
the suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots .
but the people took of the spoil , sheep and oxen , the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed , to sacrifice unto the lord thy god in gilgal .
the poor is hated even of his own neighbour : but the rich hath many friends .
then samuel went to ramah ; and saul went up to his house to gibeah of saul .
and samuel came no more to see saul until the day of his death : nevertheless samuel mourned for saul : and the lord repented that he had made saul king over israel .
all the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee , and their kings shall be sore afraid , they shall be troubled in their countenance .
how he entered into the house of god , and did eat the shewbread , which was not lawful for him to eat , neither for them which were with him , but only for the priests ?
in the time when thou shalt be broken by the seas in the depths of the waters thy merchandise and all thy company in the midst of thee shall fall .
but he said unto them , have ye not read what david did , when he was an hungred , and they that were with him ;
but i say unto you , that in this place is one greater than the temple .
the merchants among the people shall hiss at thee ; thou shalt be a terror , and never shalt be any more .
or have ye not read in the law , how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath , and are blameless ?
and samuel said , as thy sword hath made women childless , so shall thy mother be childless among women . and samuel hewed agag in pieces before the lord in gilgal .
the heart knoweth his own bitterness ; and a stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy .
for the son of man is lord even of the sabbath day .
then said samuel , bring ye hither to me agag the king of the amalekites . and agag came unto him delicately . and agag said , surely the bitterness of death is past .
so samuel turned again after saul ; and saul worshipped the lord .
there is a way which seemeth right unto a man , but the end thereof are the ways of death .
then he said , i have sinned : yet honour me now , i pray thee , before the elders of my people , and before israel , and turn again with me , that i may worship the lord thy god .
the house of the wicked shall be overthrown : but the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish .

and david went on , and grew great , and the lord god of hosts was with him .
and hiram king of tyre sent messengers to david , and cedar trees , and carpenters , and masons : and they built david an house .
the philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of rephaim .
and david inquired of the lord , saying , shall i go up to the philistines ? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand ? and the lord said unto david , go up : for i will doubtless deliver the philistines into thine hand .
but when the philistines heard that they had anointed david king over israel , all the philistines came up to seek david ; and david heard of it , and went down to the hold .
and david came to baal - perazim , and david smote them there , and said , the lord hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me , as the breach of waters . therefore he called the name of that place baal - perazim .
and there they left their images , and david and his men burned them .
and the philistines came up yet again , and spread themselves in the valley of rephaim .
and when david inquired of the lord , he said , thou shalt not go up ; but fetch a compass behind them , and come upon them over against the mulberry trees .
and let it be , when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees , that then thou shalt bestir thyself : for then shall the lord go out before thee , to smite the host of the philistines .
and king ahaz went to damascus to meet tiglath - pileser king of assyria , and saw an altar that was at damascus : and king ahaz sent to urijah the priest the fashion of the altar , and the pattern of it , according to all the workmanship thereof .

and upon the table of shewbread they shall spread a cloth of blue , and put thereon the dishes , and the spoons , and the bowls , and covers to cover withal : and the continual bread shall be thereon :

behold , o lord ; for i am in distress : my bowels are troubled ; mine heart is turned within me ; for i have grievously rebelled : abroad the sword bereaveth , at home there is as death .
the lord is righteous ; for i have rebelled against his commandment : hear , i pray you , all people , and behold my sorrow : my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity .

and when she was come to her house , she found the devil gone out , and her daughter laid upon the bed .
and he took him aside from the multitude , and put his fingers into his ears , and he spit , and touched his tongue ;
and they bring unto him one that was deaf , and had an impediment in his speech ; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him .
and straightway his ears were opened , and the string of his tongue was loosed , and he spake plain .
and looking up to heaven , he sighed , and saith unto him , ephphatha , that is , be opened .
and were beyond measure astonished , saying , he hath done all things well : he maketh both the deaf to hear , and the dumb to speak .
and he charged them that they should tell no man : but the more he charged them , so much the more a great deal they published it ;
in whose hands is mischief , and their right hand is full of bribes .
but as for me , i will walk in mine integrity : redeem me , and be merciful unto me .
my foot standeth in an even place : in the congregations will i bless the lord .
and the lord spake suddenly unto moses , and unto aaron , and unto miriam , come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congregation . and they three came out .
and they said , hath the lord indeed spoken only by moses ? hath he not spoken also by us ? and the lord heard it .
with him will i speak mouth to mouth , even apparently , and not in dark speeches ; and the similitude of the lord shall he behold : wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant moses ?
so baasha slept with his fathers , and was buried in tirzah : and elah his son reigned in his stead .
my servant moses is not so , who is faithful in all mine house .
and his servant zimri , captain of half his chariots , conspired against him , as he was in tirzah , drinking himself drunk in the house of arza steward of his house in tirzah .
and he said , hear now my words : if there be a prophet among you , i the lord will make myself known unto him in a vision , and will speak unto him in a dream .
and the lord came down in the pillar of the cloud , and stood in the door of the tabernacle , and called aaron and miriam : and they both came forth .
behold , i will take away the posterity of baasha , and the posterity of his house ; and will make thy house like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat .
forasmuch as i exalted thee out of the dust , and made thee prince over my people israel ; and thou hast walked in the way of jeroboam , and hast made my people israel to sin , to provoke me to anger with their sins ;
now the rest of the acts of baasha , and what he did , and his might , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel ?
then the word of the lord came to jehu the son of hanani against baasha , saying ,
all my inward friends abhorred me : and they whom i loved are turned against me .
yea , young children despised me ; i arose , and they spake against me .
i called my servant , and he gave me no answer ; i intreated him with my mouth .
my breath is strange to my wife , though i intreated for the children ' s sake of mine own body .
my kinsfolk have failed , and my familiar friends have forgotten me .
they that dwell in mine house , and my maids , count me for a stranger : i am an alien in their sight .
his troops come together , and raise up their way against me , and encamp round about my tabernacle .
he hath put my brethren far from me , and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me .
he hath destroyed me on every side , and i am gone : and mine hope hath he removed like a tree .
he hath also kindled his wrath against me , and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies .
be ye afraid of the sword : for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword , that ye may know there is a judgment .
my bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh , and i am escaped with the skin of my teeth .
for i know that my redeemer liveth , and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth :
and though after my skin worms destroy this body , yet in my flesh shall i see god :
whom i shall see for myself , and mine eyes shall behold , and not another ; though my reins be consumed within me .
but ye should say , why persecute we him , seeing the root of the matter is found in me ?
have pity upon me , have pity upon me , o ye my friends ; for the hand of god hath touched me .
why do ye persecute me as god , and are not satisfied with my flesh ?
that they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever !
endeavouring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace .
one lord , one faith , one baptism ,
one god and father of all , who is above all , and through all , and in you all .
i therefore , the prisoner of the lord , beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called ,
with all lowliness and meekness , with longsuffering , forbearing one another in love ;
therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer , and for this i make haste .
then answered zophar the naamathite , and said ,
the eye also which saw him shall see him no more ; neither shall his place any more behold him .
yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung : they which have seen him shall say , where is he ?
he shall fly away as a dream , and shall not be found : yea , he shall be chased away as a vision of the night .
that the triumphing of the wicked is short , and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment ?
though his excellency mount up to the heavens , and his head reach unto the clouds ;
i have heard the check of my reproach , and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer .
knowest thou not this of old , since man was placed upon earth ,
send thee help from the sanctuary , and strengthen thee out of zion ;
remember all thy offerings , and accept thy burnt sacrifice ; selah .
the lord hear thee in the day of trouble ; the name of the god of jacob defend thee ;
in that ye have brought into my sanctuary strangers , uncircumcised in heart , and uncircumcised in flesh , to be in my sanctuary , to pollute it , even my house , when ye offer my bread , the fat and the blood , and they have broken my covenant because of all your abominations .
and thou shalt say to the rebellious , even to the house of israel , thus saith the lord god ; o ye house of israel , let it suffice you of all your abominations ,
then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house : and i looked , and , behold , the glory of the lord filled the house of the lord : and i fell upon my face .
thus saith the lord god ; no stranger , uncircumcised in heart , nor uncircumcised in flesh , shall enter into my sanctuary , of any stranger that is among the children of israel .
and ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things : but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves .
we will rejoice in thy salvation , and in the name of our god we will set up our banners : the lord fulfil all thy petitions .
grant thee according to thine own heart , and fulfil all thy counsel .
some trust in chariots , and some in horses : but we will remember the name of the lord our god .
now know i that the lord saveth his anointed ; he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand .
save , lord : let the king hear us when we call .
they are brought down and fallen : but we are risen , and stand upright .
then said the lord unto me ; this gate shall be shut , it shall not be opened , and no man shall enter in by it ; because the lord , the god of israel , hath entered in by it , therefore it shall be shut .
it is for the prince ; the prince , he shall sit in it to eat bread before the lord ; he shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate , and shall go out by the way of the same .
then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary which looketh toward the east ; and it was shut .
for tophet is ordained of old ; yea , for the king it is prepared ; he hath made it deep and large : the pile thereof is fire and much wood ; the breath of the lord , like a stream of brimstone , doth kindle it .
and in every place where the grounded staff shall pass , which the lord shall lay upon him , it shall be with tabrets and harps : and in battles of shaking will he fight with it .
for through the voice of the lord shall the assyrian be beaten down , which smote with a rod .
and the lord shall cause his glorious voice to be heard , and shall shew the lighting down of his arm , with the indignation of his anger , and with the flame of a devouring fire , with scattering , and tempest , and hailstones .
and the sons of his brother helem ; zophah , and imna , and shelesh , and amal .
bezer , and hod , and shamma and shilshah , and ithran , and beera .
the sons of zophah ; suah , and harnepher , and shual , and beri , and imrah ,
and ye shall hallow the fiftieth year , and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof : it shall be a jubile unto you ; and ye shall return every man unto his possession , and ye shall return every man unto his family .
the sons of asher ; imnah , and isuah , and ishuai , and beriah , and serah their sister .
and the sons of japhlet ; pasach , and bimhal , and ashvath . these are the children of japhlet .
for it is the jubile ; it shall be holy unto you : ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field .
and heber begat japhlet , and shomer , and hotham , and shua their sister .
a jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you : ye shall not sow , neither reap that which groweth of itself in it , nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed .
and i will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation , and the altar : i will sanctify also both aaron and his sons , to minister to me in the priest ' s office .
in the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his possession .
and there i will meet with the children of israel , and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory .
and if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour , or buyest ought of thy neighbour ' s hand , ye shall not oppress one another :
and they shall know that i am the lord their god , that brought them forth out of the land of egypt , that i may dwell among them : i am the lord their god .
according to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour , and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee :
and i will dwell among the children of israel , and will be their god .
according to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof , and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it : for according to the number of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee .
non his son , jehoshua his son .
ye shall not therefore oppress one another ; but thou shalt fear thy god : for i am the lord your god .
and their possessions and habitations were , bethel and the towns thereof , and eastward naaran , and westward gezer , with the towns thereof ; shechem also and the towns thereof , unto gaza and the towns thereof :
wherefore ye shall do my statutes , and keep my judgments , and do them ; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety .
and by the borders of the children of manasseh , beth - shean and her towns , taanach and her towns , megiddo and her towns , dor and her towns . in these dwelt the children of joseph the son of israel .
and the land shall yield her fruit , and he shall eat your fill , and dwell therein in safety .
and with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil ; and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering .
this shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the lord : where i will meet you , to speak there unto thee .
and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even , and shalt do thereto according to the meat offering of the morning , and according to the drink offering thereof , for a sweet savour , an offering made by fire unto the lord .
all these were the children of asher , heads of their father ' s house , choice and mighty men of valour , chief of the princes . and the number throughout the genealogy of them that were apt to the war and to battle was twenty and six thousand men .
and thine ears shall hear a word behind thee , saying , this is the way , walk ye in it , when ye turn to the right hand , and when ye turn to the left .
and though the lord give you the bread of adversity , and the water of affliction , yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more , but thine eyes shall see thy teachers :
then shall he give the rain of thy seed , that thou shalt sow the ground withal ; and bread of the increase of the earth , and it shall be fat and plenteous : in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures .
ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver , and the ornament of thy molten images of gold : thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth ; thou shalt say unto it , get thee hence .
and the sons of jether ; jephunneh , and pispah , and ara .
and the sons of ulla ; arah , and haniel , and rezia .
and his breath , as an overflowing stream , shall reach to the midst of the neck , to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity : and there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people , causing them to err .
ye shall have a song , as in the night when a holy solemnity is kept ; and gladness of heart , as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of the lord , to the mighty one of israel .
the oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat clean provender , which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan .
and there shall be upon every high mountain , and upon every high hill , rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter , when the towers fall .
moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun , and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold , as the light of seven days , in the day that the lord bindeth up the breach of his people , and healeth the stroke of their wound .
behold , the name of the lord cometh from far , burning with his anger , and the burden thereof is heavy : his lips are full of indignation , and his tongue as a devouring fire :
and the holy garments of aaron shall be his sons ' after him , to be anointed therein , and to be consecrated in them .
get you out of the way , turn aside out of the path , cause the holy one of israel to cease from before us .
but when johanan the son of kareah , and all the captains of the forces that were with him , heard of all the evil that ishmael the son of nethaniah had done ,
wherefore thus saith the holy one of israel , because ye despise this word , and trust in oppression and perverseness , and stay thereon :
then they took all the men , and went to fight with ishmael the son of nethaniah , and found him by the great waters that are in gibeon .
which say to the seers , see not ; and to the prophets , prophesy not unto us right things , speak unto us smooth things , prophesy deceits :
but ye said , no ; for we will flee upon horses ; therefore shall ye flee : and , we will ride upon the swift ; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift .
for thus saith the lord god , the holy one of israel ; in returning and rest shall ye be saved ; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength : and ye would not .
but ishmael the son of nethaniah escaped from johanan with eight men , and went to the ammonites .
and he shall break it as the breaking of the potters ' vessel that is broken in pieces ; he shall not spare : so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth , or to take water withal out of the pit .
so all the people that ishmael had carried away captive from mizpah cast about and returned , and went unto johanan the son of kareah .
therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall , swelling out in a high wall , whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant .
now it came to pass , that when all the people which were with ishmael saw johanan the son of kareah , and all the captains of the forces that were with him , then they were glad .
and therefore will the lord wait , that he may be gracious unto you , and therefore will he be exalted , that he may have mercy upon you : for the lord is a god of judgment : blessed are all they that wait for him .
because of the chaldeans : for they were afraid of them , because ishmael the son of nethaniah had slain gedaliah the son of ahikam , whom the king of babylon made governor in the land .
one thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one ; at the rebuke of five shall ye flee : till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain , and as an ensign on an hill .
and they departed , and dwelt in the habitation of chimham , which is by bethlehem , to go to enter into egypt ,
and thou shalt receive them of their hands , and burn them upon the altar for a burnt offering , for a sweet savour before the lord : it is an offering made by fire unto the lord .
and thou shalt take the breast of the ram of aaron ' s consecration , and wave it for a wave offering before the lord : and it shall be thy part .
and it shall be aaron ' s and his sons ' by a statute for ever from the children of israel : for it is an heave offering : and it shall be an heave offering from the children of israel of the sacrifice of their peace offerings , even their heave offering unto the lord .
also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump , and the fat that covereth the inwards , and the caul above the liver , and the two kidneys , and the fat that is upon them , and the right shoulder ; for it is a ram of consecration :
and one loaf of bread , and one cake of oiled bread , and one wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread that is before the lord :
and thou shalt put all in the hands of aaron , and in the hands of his sons ; and shalt wave them for a wave offering before the lord .
then the people rejoiced , for that they offered willingly , because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the lord : and david the king also rejoiced with great joy .
and gave for the service of the house of god of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams , and of silver ten thousand talents , and of brass eighteen thousand talents , and one hundred thousand talents of iron .
and they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the lord , by the hand of jehiel the gershonite .
the gold for things of gold , and the silver for things of silver , and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers . and who then is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the lord ?
then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of israel , and the captains of thousands and of hundreds , with the rulers of the king ' s work , offered willingly ,
moreover , because i have set my affection to the house of my god , i have of mine own proper good , of gold and silver , which i have given to the house of my god , over and above all that i have prepared for the holy house ,
even three thousand talents of gold , of the gold of ophir , and seven thousand talents of refined silver , to overlay the walls of the houses withal :
but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of christ .
and that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven days , when he cometh into the tabernacle of the congregation to minister in the holy place .
wherefore he saith , when he ascended up on high , he led captivity captive , and gave gifts unto men .
( now that he ascended , what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth ?
furthermore david the king said unto all the congregation , solomon my son , whom alone god hath chosen , is yet young and tender , and the work is great : for the palace is not for man , but for the lord god .
the one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning ; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even :
and thou shalt offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for atonement : and thou shalt cleanse the altar , when thou hast made an atonement for it , and thou shalt anoint it , to sanctify it .
seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar , and sanctify it ; and it shall be an altar most holy : whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy .
and if ought of the flesh of the consecrations , or of the bread , remain unto the morning , then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire : it shall not be eaten , because it is holy .
and thus shalt thou do unto aaron , and to his sons , according to all things which i have commanded thee : seven days shalt thou consecrate them .
and aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram , and the bread that is in the basket , by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
and they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was made , to consecrate and to sanctify them : but a stranger shall not eat thereof , because they are holy .
and the redeemer shall come to zion , and unto them that turn from transgression in jacob , saith the lord .
o god , be not far from me : o my god , make haste for my help .
saying , god hath forsaken him : persecute and take him ; for there is none to deliver him .
but i will hope continually , and will yet praise thee more and more .
let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul ; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt .
i will go in the strength of the lord god : i will make mention of thy righteousness , even of thine only .
my mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day ; for i know not the numbers thereof .
now also when i am old and grayheaded , o god , forsake me not ; until i have shewed thy strength unto this generation , and thy power to every one that is to come .
o god , thou hast taught me from my youth : and hitherto have i declared thy wondrous works .
for mine enemies speak against me ; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together ,
we roar all like bears , and mourn sore like doves : we look for judgment , but there is none ; for salvation , but it is far off from us .
we grope for the wall like the blind , and we grope as if we had no eyes : we stumble at noonday as in the night ; we are in desolate places as dead men .
and thou shalt take the other ram ; and aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram .
and thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar : it is a burnt offering unto the lord : it is a sweet savour , an offering made by fire unto the lord .
so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west , and his glory from the rising of the sun . when the enemy shall come in like a flood , the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against him .
according to their deeds , accordingly he will repay , fury to his adversaries , recompence to his enemies ; to the islands he will repay recompence .
thy righteousness also , o god , is very high , who hast done great things : o god , who is like unto thee !
for he put on righteousness as a breastplate , and an helmet of salvation upon his head ; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing , and was clad with zeal as a cloke .
and he saw that there was no man , and wondered that there was no intercessor : therefore his arm brought salvation unto him ; and his righteousness , it sustained him .
yea , truth faileth ; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey : and the lord saw it , and it displeased him that there was no judgment .
and judgment is turned away backward , and justice standeth afar off : for truth is fallen in the street , and equity cannot enter .
in transgressing and lying against the lord , and departing away from our god , speaking oppression and revolt , conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood .
my tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long : for they are confounded , for they are brought unto shame , that seek my hurt .
my lips shall greatly rejoice when i sing unto thee ; and my soul , which thou hast redeemed .
i will also praise thee with the psaltery , even thy truth , o my god : unto thee will i sing with the harp , o thou holy one of israel .
and thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock , and put it upon the horns of the altar with thy finger , and pour all the blood beside the bottom of the altar .
and thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards , and the caul that is above the liver , and the two kidneys , and the fat that is upon them , and burn them upon the altar .
and thou shalt kill the bullock before the lord , by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
and thou shalt slay the ram , and thou shalt take his blood , and sprinkle it round about upon the altar .
thou shalt increase my greatness , and comfort me on every side .
and thou shalt cut the ram in pieces , and wash the inwards of him , and his legs , and put them unto his pieces , and unto his head .
thou , which hast shewed me great and sore troubles , shalt quicken me again , and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth .
but the flesh of the bullock , and his skin , and his dung , shalt thou burn with fire without the camp : it is a sin offering .
thou shalt also take one ram ; and aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram .
mountains , and all hills ; fruitful trees , and all cedars :
fire , and hail ; snow , and vapour ; stormy wind fulfilling his word :
praise the lord from the earth , ye dragons , and all deeps :
he hath also stablished them for ever and ever : he hath made a decree which shall not pass .
let them praise the name of the lord : for he commanded , and they were created .
praise ye the lord . praise ye the lord from the heavens : praise him in the heights .
my love be with you all in christ jesus . amen .
praise ye him , all his angels : praise ye him , all his hosts .
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you .
praise ye him , sun and moon : praise him , all ye stars of light .
if any man love not the lord jesus christ , let him be anathema maranatha .
praise him , ye heavens of heavens , and ye waters that be above the heavens .
the salutation of me paul with mine own hand .
all the brethren greet you . greet ye one another with an holy kiss .
the king ' s heart is in the hand of the lord , as the rivers of water : he turneth it whithersoever he will .
the getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death .
the robbery of the wicked shall destroy them ; because they refuse to do judgment .
the way of man is froward and strange : but as for the pure , his work is right .
it is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop , than with a brawling woman in a wide house .
every way of a man is right in his own eyes : but the lord pondereth the hearts .
to do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the lord than sacrifice .
an high look , and a proud heart , and the plowing of the wicked , is sin .
the thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness ; but of every one that is hasty only to want .
now if timotheus come , see that he may be with you without fear : for he worketh the work of the lord , as i also do .
as touching our brother apollos , i greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren : but his will was not at all to come at this time ; but he will come when he shall have convenient time .
and ezekias begat manasses ; and manasses begat amon ; and amon begat josias ;
let no man therefore despise him : but conduct him forth in peace , that he may come unto me : for i look for him with the brethren .
let all your things be done with charity .
watch ye , stand fast in the faith , quit you like men , be strong .
and azor begat sadoc ; and sadoc begat achim ; and achim begat eliud ;
and eliud begat eleazar ; and eleazar begat matthan ; and matthan begat jacob ;
and after they were brought to babylon , jechonias begat salathiel ; and salathiel begat zorobabel ;
and zorobabel begat abiud ; and abiud begat eliakim ; and eliakim begat azor ;
then joseph her husband , being a just man , and not willing to make her a publick example , was minded to put her away privily .
and jacob begat joseph the husband of mary , of whom was born jesus , who is called christ .
so all the generations from abraham to david are fourteen generations ; and from david until the carrying away into babylon are fourteen generations ; and from the carrying away into babylon unto christ are fourteen generations .
i beseech you , brethren , ( ye know the house of stephanas , that it is the firstfruits of achaia , and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints , )
that ye submit yourselves unto such , and to every one that helpeth with us , and laboureth .
i am glad of the coming of stephanas and fortunatus and achaicus : for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied .
for they have refreshed my spirit and yours : therefore acknowledge ye them that are such .
the churches of asia salute you . aquila and priscilla salute you much in the lord , with the church that is in their house .
and will make an offering by fire unto the lord , a burnt offering , or a sacrifice in performing a vow , or in a freewill offering , or in your solemn feasts , to make a sweet savour unto the lord , of the herd , or of the flock :
speak unto the children of israel , and say unto them , when ye be come into the land of your habitations , which i give unto you ,
and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice , for one lamb .
then shall he that offereth his offering unto the lord bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of oil .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
yet , lord , thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me : forgive not their iniquity , neither blot out their sin from thy sight , but let them be overthrown before thee ; deal thus with them in the time of thine anger .
let a cry be heard from their houses , when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them : for they have digged a pit to take me , and hid snares for my feet .
and the sons of ulam ; bedan . these were the sons of gilead , the son of machir , the son of manasseh .
and maachah the wife of machir bare a son , and she called his name peresh ; and the name of his brother was sheresh ; and his sons were ulam and rakem .
and the sons of shemida were , ahian , and shechem , and likhi , and aniam .
therefore deliver up their children to the famine , and pour out their blood by the force of the sword ; and let their wives be bereaved of their children , and be widows ; and let their men be put to death ; let their young men be slain by the sword in battle .
and his sister hammoleketh bare ishod , and abiezer , and mahalah .
shall evil be recompensed for good ? for they have digged a pit for my soul . remember that i stood before thee to speak good for them , and to turn away thy wrath from them .
and when he went in to his wife , she conceived , and bare a son , and he called his name beriah , because it went evil with his house .
( and his daughter was sherah , who built beth - horon the nether , and the upper , and uzzen - sherah . )
son of man , eat thy bread with quaking , and drink thy water with trembling and with carefulness ;
and rephah was his son , also resheph , and telah his son , and tahan his son ,
moreover the word of the lord came to me , saying ,
laadan his son , ammihud his son , elishama his son ,
but i will leave a few men of them from the sword , from the famine , and from the pestilence ; that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen whither they come ; and they shall know that i am the lord .
and the sons of ephraim ; shuthelah , and bered his son , and tahath his son , and eladah his son , and tahath his son ,
and zabad his son , and shuthelah his son , and ezer , and elead , whom the men of gath that were born in that land slew , because they came down to take away their cattle .
and ephraim their father mourned many days , and his brethren came to comfort him .
then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil .
say , i am your sign : like as i have done , so shall it be done unto them : they shall remove and go into captivity .
and when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering , or for a sacrifice in performing a vow , or peace offerings unto the lord :
say thou unto them , thus saith the lord god ; this burden concerneth the prince in jerusalem , and all the house of israel that are among them .
and for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an hin of wine , for a sweet savour unto the lord .
or for a ram , thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth deals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil .
and i will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to help him , and all his bands ; and i will draw out the sword after them .
my net also will i spread upon him , and he shall be taken in my snare : and i will bring him to babylon to the land of the chaldeans ; yet shall he not see it , though he shall die there .
and the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the twilight , and shall go forth : they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby : he shall cover his face , that he see not the ground with his eyes .
give heed to me , o lord , and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me .
then said they , come , and let us devise devices against jeremiah ; for the law shall not perish from the priest , nor counsel from the wise , nor the word from the prophet . come , and let us smite him with the tongue , and let us not give heed to any of his words .
i will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy ; i will shew them the back , and not the face , in the day of their calamity .
to make their land desolate , and a perpetual hissing ; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished , and wag his head .
because my people hath forgotten me , they have burned incense to vanity , and they have caused them to stumble in their ways from the ancient paths , to walk in paths , in a way not cast up ;
will a man leave the snow of lebanon which cometh from the rock of the field ? or shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken ?
therefore thus saith the lord ; ask ye now among the heathen , who hath heard such things : the virgin of israel hath done a very horrible thing .
and they said , there is no hope : but we will walk after our own devices , and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart .
if it do evil in my sight , that it obey not my voice , then i will repent of the good , wherewith i said i would benefit them .
the sons of manasseh ; ashriel , whom she bare : ( but his concubine the aramitess bare machir the father of gilead :
therefore say unto them , thus saith the lord god ; there shall none of my words be prolonged any more , but the word which i have spoken shall be done , saith the lord god .
and machir took to wife the sister of huppim and shuppim , whose sister ' s name was maachah ; ) and the name of the second was zelophehad : and zelophehad had daughters .
son of man , behold , they of the house of israel say , the vision that he seeth is for many days to come , and he prophesieth of the times that are far off .
shuppim also , and huppim , the children of ir , and hushim , the sons of aher .
the sons of naphtali ; jahziel , and guni , and jezer , and shallum , the sons of bilhah .
the sons also of jediael ; bilhan : and the sons of bilhan ; jeush , and benjamin , and ehud , and chenaanah , and zethan , and tharshish , and ahishahar .
all these the sons of jediael , by the heads of their fathers , mighty men of valour , were seventeen thousand and two hundred soldiers , fit to go out for war and battle .
and the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste , and the land shall be desolate ; and ye shall know that i am the lord .
son of man , what is that proverb that ye have in the land of israel , saying , the days are prolonged , and every vision faileth ?
and the word of the lord came unto me , saying ,
for there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of israel .
tell them therefore , thus saith the lord god ; i will make this proverb to cease , and they shall no more use it as a proverb in israel ; but say unto them , the days are at hand , and the effect of every vision .
again the word of the lord came to me , saying ,
for i am the lord : i will speak , and the word that i shall speak shall come to pass ; it shall be no more prolonged : for in your days , o rebellious house , will i say the word , and will perform it , saith the lord god .
zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign , and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem . and his mother ' s name was hamutal , the daughter of jeremiah of libnah .
and the king of babylon made mattaniah his father ' s brother king in his stead , and changed his name to zedekiah .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord , according to all that jehoiakim had done .
and he carried away all jerusalem , and all the princes , and all the mighty men of valour , even ten thousand captives , and all the craftsmen and smiths : none remained , save the poorest sort of the people of the land .
and all the men of might , even seven thousand , and craftsmen and smiths a thousand , all that were strong and apt for war , even them the king of babylon brought captive to babylon .
and he carried away jehoiachin to babylon , and the king ' s mother , and the king ' s wives , and his officers , and the mighty of the land , those carried he into captivity from jerusalem to babylon .
at that time the servants of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came up against jerusalem , and the city was besieged .
and jehoiachin the king of judah went out to the king of babylon , he , and his mother , and his servants , and his princes , and his officers : and the king of babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign .
and nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came against the city , and his servants did besiege it .
and there shall be no remnant of them : for i will bring evil upon the men of anathoth , even the year of their visitation .
but , o lord of hosts , that judgest righteously , that triest the reins and the heart , let me see thy vengeance on them : for unto thee have i revealed my cause .
therefore thus saith the lord of hosts , behold , i will punish them : the young men shall die by the sword ; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine :
therefore thus saith the lord of the men of anathoth , that seek thy life , saying , prophesy not in the name of the lord , that thou die not by our hand :
but what saith it ? the word is nigh thee , even in thy mouth , and in thy heart : that is , the word of faith , which we preach ;
or , who shall descend into the deep ? ( that is , to bring up christ again from the dead . )
but the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise , say not in thine heart , who shall ascend into heaven ? ( that is , to bring christ down from above : )
for moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law , that the man which doeth those things shall live by them .
that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus , and shalt believe in thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead , thou shalt be saved .
but job answered and said ,
for they being ignorant of god ' s righteousness , and going about to establish their own righteousness , have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of god .
for christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth .
brethren , my heart ' s desire and prayer to god for israel is , that they might be saved .
for i bear them record that they have a zeal of god , but not according to knowledge .
and the word of the lord came unto him , saying ,
and it shall be , that thou shalt drink of the brook ; and i have commanded the ravens to feed thee there .
get thee hence , and turn thee eastward , and hide thyself by the brook cherith , that is before jordan .
and the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning , and bread and flesh in the evening ; and he drank of the brook .
so he went and did according unto the word of the lord : for he went and dwelt by the brook cherith , that is before jordan .
and the word of the lord came unto him , saying ,
and it came to pass after a while , that the brook dried up , because there had been no rain in the land .
arise , get thee to zarephath , which belongeth to zidon , and dwell there : behold , i have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee .
then eli called samuel , and said , samuel , my son . and he answered , here am i .
and samuel lay until the morning , and opened the doors of the house of the lord . and samuel feared to shew eli the vision .
and therefore i have sworn unto the house of eli , that the iniquity of eli ' s house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever .
for i have told him that i will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth ; because his sons made themselves vile , and he restrained them not .
and samuel grew , and the lord was with him , and did let none of his words fall to the ground .
and samuel told him every whit , and hid nothing from him . and he said , it is the lord : let him do what seemeth him good .
and he said , what is the thing that the lord hath said unto thee ? i pray thee hide it not from me : god do so to thee , and more also , if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee .
i am my beloved ' s , and his desire is toward me .
come , my beloved , let us go forth into the field ; let us lodge in the villages .
in that day i will perform against eli all things which i have spoken concerning his house : when i begin , i will also make an end .
and the lord said to samuel , behold , i will do a thing in israel , at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle .
and the lord came , and stood , and called as at other times , samuel , samuel . then samuel answered , speak ; for thy servant heareth .
i gave thee a king in mine anger , and took him away in my wrath .
the iniquity of ephraim is bound up ; his sin is hid .
i will be thy king : where is any other that may save thee in all thy cities ? and thy judges of whom thou saidst , give me a king and princes ?
and the lord appeared again in shiloh : for the lord revealed himself to samuel in shiloh by the word of the lord .
i will ransom them from the power of the grave ; i will redeem them from death : o death , i will be thy plagues ; o grave , i will be thy destruction : repentance shall be hid from mine eyes .
and all israel from dan even to beer - sheba knew that samuel was established to be a prophet of the lord .
the sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him : he is an unwise son ; for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of children .
samaria shall become desolate ; for she hath rebelled against her god : they shall fall by the sword : their infants shall be dashed in pieces , and their women with child shall be ripped up .
though he be fruitful among his brethren , an east wind shall come , the wind of the lord shall come up from the wilderness , and his spring shall become dry , and his fountain shall be dried up : he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels .
and knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son : and he called his name jesus .
then joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the lord had bidden him , and took unto him his wife :
behold , a virgin shall be with child , and shall bring forth a son , and they shall call his name emmanuel , which being interpreted is , god with us .
and she shall bring forth a son , and thou shalt call his name jesus : for he shall save his people from their sins .
but while he thought on these things , behold , the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a dream , saying , joseph , thou son of david , fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife : for that which is conceived in her is of the holy ghost .
and with you there shall be a man of every tribe ; every one head of the house of his fathers .
from twenty years old and upward , all that are able to go forth to war in israel : thou and aaron shall number them by their armies .
for through the anger of the lord it came to pass in jerusalem and judah , until he had cast them out from his presence , that zedekiah rebelled against the king of babylon .
take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of israel , after their families , by the house of their fathers , with the number of their names , every male by their polls ;
and the lord spake unto moses in the wilderness of sinai , in the tabernacle of the congregation , on the first day of the second month , in the second year after they were come out of the land of egypt , saying ,
of issachar ; nethaneel the son of zuar .
of judah ; nahshon the son of amminadab .
of simeon ; shelumiel the son of zurishaddai .
and these are the names of the men that shall stand with you : of the tribe of reuben ; elizur the son of shedeur .
of zebulun ; eliab the son of helon .
let us get up early to the vineyards ; let us see if the vine flourish , whether the tender grape appear , and the pomegranates bud forth : there will i give thee my loves .
they kept not the covenant of god , and refused to walk in his law ;
marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers , in the land of egypt , in the field of zoan .
he divided the sea , and caused them to pass through ; and he made the waters to stand as an heap .
in the daytime also he led them with a cloud , and all the night with a light of fire .
he clave the rocks in the wilderness , and gave them drink as out of the great depths .
he brought streams also out of the rock , and caused waters to run down like rivers .
and they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most high in the wilderness .
and they tempted god in their heart by asking meat for their lust .
yea , they spake against god ; they said , can god furnish a table in the wilderness ?
humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god , that he may exalt you in due time :
he that rejecteth me , and receiveth not my words , hath one that judgeth him : the word that i have spoken , the same shall judge him in the last day .
and they lifted up their voice , and wept again : and orpah kissed her mother in law ; but ruth clave unto her .
the noise thereof sheweth concerning it , the cattle also concerning the vapour .
likewise , ye younger , submit yourselves unto the elder . yea , all of you be subject one to another , and be clothed with humility : for god resisteth the proud , and giveth grace to the humble .
for i have not spoken of myself ; but the father which sent me , he gave me a commandment , what i should say , and what i should speak .
would ye tarry for them till they were grown ? would ye stay for them from having husbands ? nay , my daughters ; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the lord is gone out against me .
be sober , be vigilant ; because your adversary the devil , as a roaring lion , walketh about , seeking whom he may devour :
i am come a light into the world , that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness .
and ruth said , intreat me not to leave thee , or to return from following after thee : for whither thou goest , i will go ; and where thou lodgest , i will lodge : thy people shall be my people , and thy god my god :
for by them judgeth he the people ; he giveth meat in abundance .
casting all your care upon him ; for he careth for you .
and if any man hear my words , and believe not , i judge him not : for i came not to judge the world , but to save the world .
and she said , behold , thy sister in law is gone back unto her people , and unto her gods : return thou after thy sister in law .
with clouds he covereth the light ; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt .
when she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her , then she left speaking unto her .
whom resist stedfast in the faith , knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world .
where thou diest , will i die , and there will i be buried : the lord do so to me , and more also , if ought but death part thee and me .
behold , he spreadeth his light upon it , and covereth the bottom of the sea .
he hath blinded their eyes , and hardened their heart ; that they should not see with their eyes , nor understand with their heart , and be converted , and i should heal them .
these things said esaias , when he saw his glory , and spake of him .
feed the flock of god which is among you , taking the oversight thereof , not by constraint , but willingly ; not for filthy lucre , but of a ready mind ;
jesus cried and said , he that believeth on me , believeth not on me , but on him that sent me .
the elders which are among you i exhort , who am also an elder , and a witness of the sufferings of christ , and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed :
and he that seeth me seeth him that sent me .
and when the chief shepherd shall appear , ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away .
nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him ; but because of the pharisees they did not confess him , lest they should be put out of the synagogue :
turn again , my daughters , go your way ; for i am too old to have an husband . if i should say , i have hope , if i should have an husband also to night , and should also bear sons ;
neither as being lords over god ' s heritage , but being ensamples to the flock .
for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of god .
and naomi said , turn again , my daughters : why will ye go with me ? are there yet any more sons in my womb , that they may be your husbands ?
also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds , or the noise of his tabernacle ?
which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly .
every man may see it ; man may behold it afar off .
remember that thou magnify his work , which men behold .
for he maketh small the drops of water : they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof :
but god said unto me , thou shalt not build an house for my name , because thou hast been a man of war , and hast shed blood .
behold , god is great , and we know him not , neither can the number of his years be searched out .
and of all my sons , ( for the lord hath given me many sons , ) he hath chosen solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the lord over israel .
take heed , regard not iniquity : for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction .
moreover i will establish his kingdom for ever , if he be constant to do my commandments and my judgments , as at this day .
behold , god exalteth by his power : who teacheth like him ?
and he said unto me , solomon thy son , he shall build my house and my courts : for i have chosen him to be my son , and i will be his father .
who hath enjoined him his way ? or who can say , thou hast wrought iniquity ?
now therefore in the sight of all israel the congregation of the lord , and in the audience of our god , keep and seek for all the commandments of the lord your god : that ye may possess this good land , and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for ever .
and i know that his commandment is life everlasting : whatsoever i speak therefore , even as the father said unto me , so i speak .
and the dragon was wroth with the woman , and went to make war with the remnant of her seed , which keep the commandments of god , and have the testimony of jesus christ .
and the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman , that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood .
and the earth helped the woman , and the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth .
and when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth , he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child .
and to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle , that she might fly into the wilderness , into her place , where she is nourished for a time , and times , and half a time , from the face of the serpent .
and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb , and by the word of their testimony ; and they loved not their lives unto the death .
therefore rejoice , ye heavens , and ye that dwell in them . woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea ! for the devil is come down unto you , having great wrath , because he knoweth that he hath but a short time .
and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven , now is come salvation , and strength , and the kingdom of our god , and the power of his christ : for the accuser of our brethren is cast down , which accused them before our god day and night .
father , glorify thy name . then came there a voice from heaven , saying , i have both glorified it , and will glorify it again .
the people therefore , that stood by , and heard it , said that it thundered : others said , an angel spake to him .
if any man serve me , let him follow me ; and where i am , there shall also my servant be : if any man serve me , him will my father honour .
now is my soul troubled ; and what shall i say ? father , save me from this hour : but for this cause came i unto this hour .
verily , verily , i say unto you , except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die , it abideth alone : but if it die , it bringeth forth much fruit .
he that loveth his life shall lose it ; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal .
philip cometh and telleth andrew : and again andrew and philip tell jesus .
and jesus answered them , saying , the hour is come , that the son of man should be glorified .
and there were certain greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast :
the same came therefore to philip , which was of bethsaida of galilee , and desired him , saying , sir , we would see jesus .
therefore they could not believe , because that esaias said again ,
then jesus said unto them , yet a little while is the light with you . walk while ye have the light , lest darkness come upon you : for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth .
while ye have light , believe in the light , that ye may be the children of light . these things spake jesus , and departed , and did hide himself from them .
but though he had done so many miracles before them , yet they believed not on him :
now is the judgment of this world : now shall the prince of this world be cast out .
and i , if i be lifted up from the earth , will draw all men unto me .
this he said , signifying what death he should die .
the people answered him , we have heard out of the law that christ abideth for ever : and how sayest thou , the son of man must be lifted up ? who is this son of man ?
jesus answered and said , this voice came not because of me , but for your sakes .
and wheresoever he taketh him , he teareth him : and he foameth , and gnasheth with his teeth , and pineth away : and i spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out ; and they could not .
he answereth him , and saith , o faithless generation , how long shall i be with you ? how long shall i suffer you ? bring him unto me .
he cast out the heathen also before them , and divided them an inheritance by line , and made the tribes of israel to dwell in their tents .
and they kept that saying with themselves , questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean .
and he brought them to the border of his sanctuary , even to this mountain , which his right hand had purchased .
and they asked him , saying , why say the scribes that elias must first come ?
but turned back , and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers : they were turned aside like a deceitful bow .
and he answered and told them , elias verily cometh first , and restoreth all things ; and how it is written of the son of man , that he must suffer many things , and be set at nought .
yet they tempted and provoked the most high god , and kept not his testimonies :
but i say unto you , that elias is indeed come , and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed , as it is written of him .
when god heard this , he was wroth , and greatly abhorred israel :
and when he came to his disciples , he saw a great multitude about them , and the scribes questioning with them .
for they provoked him to anger with their high places , and moved him to jealousy with their graven images .
and straightway all the people , when they beheld him , were greatly amazed , and running to him saluted him .
and he asked the scribes , what question ye with them ?
and one of the multitude answered and said , master , i have brought unto thee my son , which hath a dumb spirit ;
and his brother ' s name was jubal : he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ .
and adah bare jabal : he was the father of such as dwell in tents , and of such as have cattle .
and lamech said unto his wives , adah and zillah , hear my voice ; ye wives of lamech , hearken unto my speech : for i have slain a man to my wounding , and a young man to my hurt .
he made a way to his anger ; he spared not their soul from death , but gave their life over to the pestilence ;
and zillah , she also bare tubal - cain , an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron : and the sister of tubal - cain was naamah .
and smote all the firstborn in egypt ; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of ham :
and adam knew his wife again ; and she bare a son , and called his name seth : for god , said she , hath appointed me another seed instead of abel , whom cain slew .
but made his own people to go forth like sheep , and guided them in the wilderness like a flock .
if cain shall be avenged sevenfold , truly lamech seventy and sevenfold .
and he led them on safely , so that they feared not : but the sea overwhelmed their enemies .
and to seth , to him also there was born a son ; and he called his name enos : then began men to call upon the name of the lord .
and david was greatly distressed ; for the people spake of stoning him , because the soul of all the people was grieved , every man for his sons and for his daughters : but david encouraged himself in the lord his god .
and david said to abiathar the priest , ahimelech ' s son , i pray thee , bring me hither the ephod . and abiathar brought thither the ephod to david .
and david inquired at the lord , saying , shall i pursue after this troop ? shall i overtake them ? and he answered him , pursue : for thou shalt surely overtake them , and without fail recover all .
so david went , he and the six hundred men that were with him , and came to the brook besor , where those that were left behind stayed .
he gave also their increase unto the caterpiller , and their labour unto the locust .
he sent divers sorts of flies among them , which devoured them ; and frogs , which destroyed them .
how he had wrought his signs in egypt , and his wonders in the field of zoan :
he cast upon them the fierceness of his anger , wrath , and indignation , and trouble , by sending evil angels among them .
he gave up their cattle also to the hail , and their flocks to hot thunderbolts .
he destroyed their vines with hail , and their sycomore trees with frost .
but the chief priests consulted that they might put lazarus also to death ;
yea , they turned back and tempted god , and limited the holy one of israel .
they remembered not his hand , nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy .
on the next day much people that were come to the feast , when they heard that jesus was coming to jerusalem ,
because that by reason of him many of the jews went away , and believed on jesus .
how oft did they provoke him in the wilderness , and grieve him in the desert !
and jesus , when he had found a young ass , sat thereon ; as it is written ,
took branches of palm trees , and went forth to meet him , and cried , hosanna : blessed is the king of israel that cometh in the name of the lord .
these things understood not his disciples at the first : but when jesus was glorified , then remembered they that these things were written of him , and that they had done these things unto him .
fear not , daughter of sion : behold , thy king cometh , sitting on an ass ' s colt .
the people therefore that was with him when he called lazarus out of his grave , and raised him from the dead , bare record .
the pharisees therefore said among themselves , perceive ye how ye prevail nothing ? behold , the world is gone after him .
he delivereth the poor in his affliction , and openeth their ears in oppression .
even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place , where there is no straitness ; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness .
but the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath : they cry not when he bindeth them .
they die in youth , and their life is among the unclean .
will he esteem thy riches ? no , not gold , nor all the forces of strength .
but thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked : judgment and justice take hold on thee .
because there is wrath , beware lest he take thee away with his stroke : then a great ransom cannot deliver thee .
for their heart was not right with him , neither were they stedfast in his covenant .
and he took a child , and set him in the midst of them : and when he had taken him in his arms , he said unto them ,
nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth , and they lied unto him with their tongues .
whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name , receiveth me : and whosoever shall receive me , receiveth not me , but him that sent me .
for he remembered that they were but flesh ; a wind that passeth away , and cometh not again .
and john answered him , saying , master , we saw one casting out devils in thy name , and he followeth not us : and we forbad him , because he followeth not us .
but jesus said , forbid him not : for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name , that can lightly speak evil of me .
but he , being full of compassion , forgave their iniquity , and destroyed them not : yea , many a time turned he his anger away , and did not stir up all his wrath .
therefore their days did he consume in vanity , and their years in trouble .
but they understood not that saying , and were afraid to ask him .
for all this they sinned still , and believed not for his wondrous works .
and he came to capernaum : and being in the house he asked them , what was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way ?
and they remembered that god was their rock , and the high god their redeemer .
but they held their peace : for by the way they had disputed among themselves , who should be the greatest .
and he sat down , and called the twelve , and saith unto them , if any man desire to be first , the same shall be last of all , and servant of all .
they were not estranged from their lust . but while their meat was yet in their mouths ,
for he taught his disciples , and said unto them , the son of man is delivered into the hands of men , and they shall kill him ; and after that he is killed , he shall rise the third day .
the wrath of god came upon them , and slew the fattest of them , and smote down the chosen men of israel .
and they departed thence , and passed through galilee ; and he would not that any man should know it .
and david ' s two wives were taken captives , ahinoam the jezreelitess , and abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite .
as for me , is my complaint to man ? and if it were so , why should not my spirit be troubled ?
then david and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept , until they had no more power to weep .
mark me , and be astonished , and lay your hand upon your mouth .
so david and his men came to the city , and , behold , it was burned with fire ; and their wives , and their sons , and their daughters , were taken captives .
hear diligently my speech , and let this be your consolations .
and had taken the women captives , that were therein : they slew not any , either great or small , but carried them away , and went on their way .
suffer me that i may speak ; and after that i have spoken , mock on .
and it came to pass , when david and his men were come to ziklag on the third day , that the amalekites had invaded the south , and ziklag , and smitten ziklag , and burned it with fire ;
their seed is established in their sight with them , and their offspring before their eyes .
but if they obey not , they shall perish by the sword , and they shall die without knowledge .
their houses are safe from fear , neither is the rod of god upon them .
even when i remember i am afraid , and trembling taketh hold on my flesh .
he openeth also their ear to discipline , and commandeth that they return from iniquity .
wherefore do the wicked live , become old , yea , are mighty in power ?
whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify god for your professed subjection unto the gospel of christ , and for your liberal distribution unto them , and unto all men ;
for the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints , but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto god ;
being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness , which causeth through us thanksgiving to god .
thanks be unto god for his unspeakable gift .
and by their prayer for you , which long after you for the exceeding grace of god in you .
so they did eat , and were well filled : for he gave them their own desire ;
and he let it fall in the midst of their camp , round about their habitations .
but jesus took him by the hand , and lifted him up ; and he arose .
he rained flesh also upon them as dust , and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea :
and when he was come into the house , his disciples asked him privately , why could not we cast him out ?
he caused an east wind to blow in the heaven : and by his power he brought in the south wind .
when jesus saw that the people came running together , he rebuked the foul spirit , saying unto him , thou dumb and deaf spirit , i charge thee , come out of him , and enter no more into him .
man did eat angels ' food : he sent them meat to the full .
and the spirit cried , and rent him sore , and came out of him : and he was as one dead ; insomuch that many said , he is dead .
and had rained down manna upon them to eat , and had given them of the corn of heaven .
jesus said unto him , if thou canst believe , all things are possible to him that believeth .
though he had commanded the clouds from above , and opened the doors of heaven ,
and straightway the father of the child cried out , and said with tears , lord , i believe ; help thou mine unbelief .
because they believed not in god , and trusted not in his salvation :
and he asked his father , how long is it ago since this came unto him ? and he said , of a child .
therefore the lord heard this , and was wroth : so a fire was kindled against jacob , and anger also came up against israel ;
and ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire , and into the waters , to destroy him : but if thou canst do any thing , have compassion on us , and help us .
so naomi returned , and ruth the moabitess , her daughter in law , with her , which returned out of the country of moab : and they came to bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest .
behold , thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth ; and from thy face shall i be hid ; and i shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth ; and it shall come to pass , that every one that findeth me shall slay me .
and they brought him unto him : and when he saw him , straightway the spirit tare him ; and he fell on the ground , and wallowed foaming .
and cain said unto the lord , my punishment is greater than i can bear .
and she said unto them , call me not naomi , call me mara : for the almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me .
when thou tillest the ground , it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength ; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth .
i went out full , and the lord hath brought me home again empty : why then call ye me naomi , seeing the lord hath testified against me , and the almighty hath afflicted me ?
and now art thou cursed from the earth , which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother ' s blood from thy hand ;
and he said , what hast thou done ? the voice of thy brother ' s blood crieth unto me from the ground .
and lamech took unto him two wives : the name of the one was adah , and the name of the other zillah .
and unto enoch was born irad : and irad begat mehujael : and mehujael begat methusael : and methusael begat lamech .
and cain knew his wife ; and she conceived , and bare enoch : and he builded a city , and called the name of the city , after the name of his son , enoch .
and cain went out from the presence of the lord , and dwelt in the land of nod , on the east of eden .
and the lord said unto him , therefore whosoever slayeth cain , vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold . and the lord set a mark upon cain , lest any finding him should kill him .
salt is good : but if the salt have lost his saltness , wherewith will ye season it ? have salt in yourselves , and have peace one with another .
the king shall joy in thy strength , o lord ; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice !
thine hand shall find out all thine enemies : thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee .
for the king trusteth in the lord , and through the mercy of the most high he shall not be moved .
thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger : the lord shall swallow them up in his wrath , and the fire shall devour them .
he asked life of thee , and thou gavest it him , even length of days for ever and ever .
for thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness : thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head .
for thou hast made him most blessed for ever : thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance .
his glory is great in thy salvation : honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him .
for he that is not against us is on our part .
for whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name , because ye belong to christ , verily i say unto you , he shall not lose his reward .
and whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me , it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and he were cast into the sea .
where their worm dieth not , and the fire is not quenched .
and if thy hand offend thee , cut it off : it is better for thee to enter into life maimed , than having two hands to go into hell , into the fire that never shall be quenched :
where their worm dieth not , and the fire is not quenched .
and if thy foot offend thee , cut it off : it is better for thee to enter halt into life , than having two feet to be cast into hell , into the fire that never shall be quenched :
where their worm dieth not , and the fire is not quenched .
and if thine eye offend thee , pluck it out : it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of god with one eye , than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire :
for every one shall be salted with fire , and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt .
so he fed them according to the integrity of his heart ; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands .
and they took their bones , and buried them under a tree at jabesh , and fasted seven days .
from following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed jacob his people , and israel his inheritance .
all the valiant men arose , and went all night , and took the body of saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of beth - shan , and came to jabesh , and burnt them there .
he chose david also his servant , and took him from the sheepfolds :
and they put his armour in the house of ashtaroth : and they fastened his body to the wall of beth - shan .
therefore it is come to pass , that as he cried , and they would not hear ; so they cried , and i would not hear , saith the lord of hosts :
yea , they made their hearts as an adamant stone , lest they should hear the law , and the words which the lord of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets : therefore came a great wrath from the lord of hosts .
but they refused to hearken , and pulled away the shoulder , and stopped their ears , that they should not hear .
and oppress not the widow , nor the fatherless , the stranger , nor the poor ; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart .
but i scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not . thus the land was desolate after them , that no man passed through nor returned : for they laid the pleasant land desolate .
he gave his people over also unto the sword ; and was wroth with his inheritance .
and i will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes ; and they shall know that i am the lord , when i shall lay my vengeance upon them .
and delivered his strength into captivity , and his glory into the enemy ' s hand .
therefore thus saith the lord god ; behold , i will stretch out mine hand upon the philistines , and i will cut off the cherethims , and destroy the remnant of the sea coast .
their priests fell by the sword ; and their widows made no lamentation .
thus saith the lord god ; because the philistines have dealt by revenge , and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart , to destroy it for the old hatred ;
the fire consumed their young men ; and their maidens were not given to marriage .
and i will lay my vengeance upon edom by the hand of my people israel : and they shall do in edom according to mine anger and according to my fury ; and they shall know my vengeance , saith the lord god .
therefore thus saith the lord god ; i will also stretch out mine hand upon edom , and will cut off man and beast from it ; and i will make it desolate from teman ; and they of dedan shall fall by the sword .
thus saith the lord god ; because that edom hath dealt against the house of judah by taking vengeance , and hath greatly offended , and revenged himself upon them ;
so that he forsook the tabernacle of shiloh , the tent which he placed among men ;
and i will execute judgments upon moab ; and they shall know that i am the lord .
unto the men of the east with the ammonites , and will give them in possession , that the ammonites may not be remembered among the nations .
and he built his sanctuary like high palaces , like the earth which he hath established for ever .
then the lord awaked as one out of sleep , and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine .
and he smote his enemies in the hinder parts : he put them to a perpetual reproach .
moreover he refused the tabernacle of joseph , and chose not the tribe of ephraim :
but chose the tribe of judah , the mount zion which he loved .
moreover the prince shall not take of the people ' s inheritance by oppression , to thrust them out of their possession ; but he shall give his sons inheritance out of his own possession : that my people be not scattered every man from his possession .
but if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants , then it shall be his to the year of liberty ; after it shall return to the prince : but his inheritance shall be his sons ' for them .
after he brought me through the entry , which was at the side of the gate , into the holy chambers of the priests , which looked toward the north : and , behold , there was a place on the two sides westward .
and thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning , the sixth part of an ephah , and the third part of an hin of oil , to temper with the fine flour ; a meat offering continually by a perpetual ordinance unto the lord .
thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the lord of a lamb of the first year without blemish : thou shalt prepare it every morning .
thus saith the lord god ; if the prince give a gift unto any of his sons , the inheritance thereof shall be his sons ' ; it shall be their possession by inheritance .
thus shall they prepare the lamb , and the meat offering , and the oil , every morning for a continual burnt offering .
and the prince in the midst of them , when they go in , shall go in ; and when they go forth , shall go forth .
and in the feast and in the solemnities the meat offering shall be an ephah to a bullock , and ephah to a ram , and to the lambs as he is able to give , and an hin of oil to an ephah .
now let them put away their whoredom , and the carcases of their kings , far from me , and i will dwell in the midst of them for ever .
in their setting of their threshold by my thresholds , and their post by my posts , and the wall between me and them , they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed : wherefore i have consumed them in mine anger .
so the spirit took me up , and brought me into the inner court ; and , behold , the glory of the lord filled the house .
and i heard him speaking unto me out of the house ; and the man stood by me .
then said he unto me , these are the places of them that boil , where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people .
and there was a row of building round about in them , round about them four , and it was made with boiling places under the rows round about .
then he brought me forth into the utter court , and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court ; and , behold , in every corner of the court there was a court .
then said he unto me , this is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering , where they shall bake the meat offering ; that they bear them not out into the utter court , to sanctify the people .
and the glory of the lord came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east .
and it was according to the appearance of the vision which i saw , even according to the vision that i saw when i came to destroy the city : and the visions were like the vision that i saw by the river chebar ; and i fell upon my face .
and , behold , the glory of the god of israel came from the way of the east : and his voice was like a noise of many waters : and the earth shined with his glory .
afterward he brought me to the gate , even the gate that looketh toward the east :
unto me , who am less than the least of all saints , is this grace given , that i should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ ;
how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery ; ( as i wrote afore in few words ,
if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of god which is given me to youward :
for this cause i paul , the prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles ,
whereof i was made a minister , according to the gift of the grace of god given unto me by the effectual working of his power .
that the gentiles should be fellowheirs , and of the same body , and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel :
which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men , as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit ;
whereby , when ye read , ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ )
and he said unto them , the sabbath was made for man , and not man for the sabbath :
how he went into the house of god in the days of abiathar the high priest , and did eat the shewbread , which is not lawful to eat but for the priests , and gave also to them which were with him ?
therefore the son of man is lord also of the sabbath .
and it came to pass , that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day ; and his disciples began , as they went , to pluck the ears of corn .
and no man putteth new wine into old bottles : else the new wine doth burst the bottles , and the wine is spilled , and the bottles will be marred : but new wine must be put into new bottles .
and he said unto them , have ye never read what david did , when he had need , and was an hungred , he , and they that were with him ?
and the pharisees said unto him , behold , why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful ?
therefore remove sorrow from thy heart , and put away evil from thy flesh : for childhood and youth are vanity .
no man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment : else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old , and the rent is made worse .
but the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them , and then shall they fast in those days .
but he spake the more vehemently , if i should die with thee , i will not deny thee in any wise . likewise also said they all .
and jesus saith unto him , verily i say unto thee , that this day , even in this night , before the cock crow twice , thou shalt deny me thrice .
and he taketh with him peter and james and john , and began to be sore amazed , and to be very heavy ;
and they came to a place which was named gethsemane : and he saith to his disciples , sit ye here , while i shall pray .
and saith unto them , my soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death : tarry ye here , and watch .
and he went forward a little , and fell on the ground , and prayed that , if it were possible , the hour might pass from him .
and he said , abba , father , all things are possible unto thee ; take away this cup from me : nevertheless not what i will , but what thou wilt .
and he cometh , and findeth them sleeping , and saith unto peter , simon , sleepest thou ? couldest not thou watch one hour ?
watch ye and pray , lest ye enter into temptation . the spirit truly is ready , but the flesh is weak .
and again he went away , and prayed , and spake the same words .
and jesus said unto them , can the children of the bridechamber fast , while the bridegroom is with them ? as long as they have the bridegroom with them , they cannot fast .
and the disciples of john and of the pharisees used to fast : and they come and say unto him , why do the disciples of john and of the pharisees fast , but thy disciples fast not ?
when jesus heard it , he saith unto them , they that are whole have no need of the physician , but they that are sick : i came not to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance .
and when the scribes and pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners , they said unto his disciples , how is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners ?
and it came to pass , that , as jesus sat at meat in his house , many publicans and sinners sat also together with jesus and his disciples : for there were many , and they followed him .
and as he passed by , he saw levi the son of alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom , and said unto him , follow me . and he arose and followed him .
and he went forth again by the sea side ; and all the multitude resorted unto him , and he taught them .
and immediately he arose , took up the bed , and went forth before them all ; insomuch that they were all amazed , and glorified god , saying , we never saw it on this fashion .
i say unto thee , arise , and take up thy bed , and go thy way into thine house .
and when he returned , he found them asleep again , ( for their eyes were heavy , ) neither wist they what to answer him .
but that ye may know that the son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins , ( he saith to the sick of the palsy , )
and he that betrayed him had given them a token , saying , whomsoever i shall kiss , that same is he ; take him , and lead him away safely .
and immediately , while he yet spake , cometh judas , one of the twelve , and with him a great multitude with swords and staves , from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders .
rise up , let us go ; lo , he that betrayeth me is at hand .
and he cometh the third time , and saith unto them , sleep on now , and take your rest : it is enough , the hour is come ; behold , the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
and jesus answered and said unto them , are ye come out , as against a thief , with swords and with staves to take me ?
and as soon as he was come , he goeth straightway to him , and saith , master , master ; and kissed him .
and they laid their hands on him , and took him .
i was daily with you in the temple teaching , and ye took me not : but the scriptures must be fulfilled .
and when they heard it , they were glad , and promised to give him money . and he sought how he might conveniently betray him .
and judas iscariot , one of the twelve , went unto the chief priests , to betray him unto them .
and his disciples went forth , and came into the city , and found as he had said unto them : and they made ready the passover .
and in the evening he cometh with the twelve .
and as they sat and did eat , jesus said , verily i say unto you , one of you which eateth with me shall betray me .
and they began to be sorrowful , and to say unto him one by one , is it i ? and another said , is it i ?
and the first day of unleavened bread , when they killed the passover , his disciples said unto him , where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover ?
and he sendeth forth two of his disciples , and saith unto them , go ye into the city , and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water : follow him .
and wheresoever he shall go in , say ye to the goodman of the house , the master saith , where is the guestchamber , where i shall eat the passover with my disciples ?
and he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared : there make ready for us .
and as they did eat , jesus took bread , and blessed , and brake it , and gave to them , and said , take , eat : this is my body .
the son of man indeed goeth , as it is written of him : but woe to that man by whom the son of man is betrayed ! good were it for that man if he had never been born .
and he answered and said unto them , it is one of the twelve , that dippeth with me in the dish .
but peter said unto him , although all shall be offended , yet will not i .
and jesus saith unto them , all ye shall be offended because of me this night : for it is written , i will smite the shepherd , and the sheep shall be scattered .
but after that i am risen , i will go before you into galilee .
verily i say unto you , i will drink no more of the fruit of the vine , until that day that i drink it new in the kingdom of god .
and when they had sung an hymn , they went out into the mount of olives .
and he took the cup , and when he had given thanks , he gave it to them : and they all drank of it .
and he said unto them , this is my blood of the new testament , which is shed for many .
these all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication , with the women , and mary the mother of jesus , and with his brethren .
and in those days peter stood up in the midst of the disciples , and said , ( the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty , )
men and brethren , this scripture must needs have been fulfilled , which the holy ghost by the mouth of david spake before concerning judas , which was guide to them that took jesus .
for he was numbered with us , and had obtained part of this ministry .
now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity ; and falling headlong , he burst asunder in the midst , and all his bowels gushed out .
and if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee , and thy brother that dwelleth by him wax poor , and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner by thee , or to the stock of the stranger ' s family :
and it was known unto all the dwellers at jerusalem ; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue , aceldama , that is to say , the field of blood .
and ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you , to inherit them for a possession ; they shall be your bondmen for ever : but over your brethren the children of israel , ye shall not rule one over another with rigour .
either his uncle , or his uncle ' s son , may redeem him , or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him ; or if he be able , he may redeem himself .
after that he is sold he may be redeemed again ; one of his brethren may redeem him :
and while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up , behold , two men stood by them in white apparel ;
which also said , ye men of galilee , why stand ye gazing up into heaven ? this same jesus , which is taken up from you into heaven , shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven .
then returned they unto jerusalem from the mount called olivet , which is from jerusalem a sabbath day ' s journey .
and when they were come in , they went up into an upper room , where abode both peter , and james , and john , and andrew , philip , and thomas , bartholomew , and matthew , james the son of alphaeus , and simon zelotes , and judas the brother of james .
only rebel not ye against the lord , neither fear ye the people of the land ; for they are bread for us : their defence is departed from them , and the lord is with us : fear them not .
if the lord delight in us , then he will bring us into this land , and give it us ; a land which floweth with milk and honey .
and they spake unto all the company of the children of israel , saying , the land , which we passed through to search it , is an exceeding good land .
for they are my servants , which i brought forth out of the land of egypt : they shall not be sold as bondmen .
thou shalt not rule over him with rigour ; but shalt fear thy god .
both thy bondmen , and thy bondmaids , which thou shalt have , shall be of the heathen that are round about you ; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids .
moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you , of them shall ye buy , and of their families that are with you , which they begat in your land : and they shall be your possession .
but as an hired servant , and as a sojourner , he shall be with thee , and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile :
and then shall he depart from thee , both he and his children with him , and shall return unto his own family , and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return .
that he may take part of this ministry and apostleship , from which judas by transgression fell , that he might go to his own place .
and they gave forth their lots ; and the lot fell upon matthias ; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles .
for it is written in the book of psalms , let his habitation be desolate , and let no man dwell therein : and his bishoprick let another take .
and they appointed two , joseph called barsabas , who was surnamed justus , and matthias .
and they prayed , and said , thou , lord , which knowest the hearts of all men , shew whether of these two thou hast chosen ,
wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the lord jesus went in and out among us ,
beginning from the baptism of john , unto that same day that he was taken up from us , must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection .
o lord , to us belongeth confusion of face , to our kings , to our princes , and to our fathers , because we have sinned against thee .
neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets , which spake in thy name to our kings , our princes , and our fathers , and to all the people of the land .
for unto me the children of israel are servants ; they are my servants whom i brought forth out of the land of egypt : i am the lord your god .
in the first year of darius the son of ahasuerus , of the seed of the medes , which was made king over the realm of the chaldeans ;
and as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him : and the other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight .
and if he be not redeemed in these years , then he shall go out in the year of jubile , both he , and his children with him .
if there be yet many years behind , according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for .
and i prayed unto the lord my god , and made my confession , and said , o lord , the great and dreadful god , keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him , and to them that keep his commandments ;
and if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile , then he shall count with him , and according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption .
we have sinned , and have committed iniquity , and have done wickedly , and have rebelled , even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments :
in the first year of his reign i daniel understood by books the number of the years , whereof the word of the lord came to jeremiah the prophet , that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of jerusalem .
and he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile : and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years , according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him .
and i set my face unto the lord god , to seek by prayer and supplication , with fasting , and sackcloth , and ashes :
if thy brother be waxen poor , and hath sold away some of his possession , and if any of his kin come to redeem it , then shall he redeem that which his brother sold .
and in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land .
then let him count the years of the sale thereof , and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it ; that he may return unto his possession .
and if the man have none to redeem it , and himself be able to redeem it ;
and if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city , then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold ; within a full year may he redeem it .
for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of god .
but if he be not able to restore it to him , then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile : and in the jubile it shall go out , and he shall return unto his possession .
of his own will begat he us with the word of truth , that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures .
let no man say when he is tempted , i am tempted of god : for god cannot be tempted with evil , neither tempteth he any man :
blessed is the man that endureth temptation : for when he is tried , he shall receive the crown of life , which the lord hath promised to them that love him .
for the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat , but it withereth the grass , and the flower thereof falleth , and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth : so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways .
but the rich , in that he is made low : because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away .
every good gift and every perfect gift is from above , and cometh down from the father of lights , with whom is no variableness , neither shadow of turning .
and if ye shall say , what shall we eat the seventh year ? behold , we shall not sow , nor gather in our increase :
do not err , my beloved brethren .
then i will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year , and it shall bring forth fruit for three years .
then when lust hath conceived , it bringeth forth sin : and sin , when it is finished , bringeth forth death .
and ye shall sow the eighth year , and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year ; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store .
but every man is tempted , when he is drawn away of his own lust , and enticed .
the land shall not be sold for ever : for the land is mine ; for ye are strangers and sojourners with me .
i am the lord your god , which brought you forth out of the land of egypt , to give you the land of canaan , and to be your god .
thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury , nor lend him thy victuals for increase .
take thou no usury of him , or increase : but fear thy god ; that thy brother may live with thee .
and if thy brother be waxen poor , and fallen in decay with thee ; then thou shalt relieve him : yea , though he be a stranger , or a sojourner ; that he may live with thee .
and if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor , and be sold unto thee ; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant :
and all the congregation lifted up their voice , and cried ; and the people wept that night .
and all the children of israel murmured against moses and against aaron : and the whole congregation said unto them , would god that we had died in the land of egypt ! or would god we had died in this wilderness !
and wherefore hath the lord brought us unto this land , to fall by the sword , that our wives and our children should be a prey ? were it not better for us to return into egypt ?
and they said one to another , let us make a captain , and let us return into egypt .
then moses and aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of israel .
and joshua the son of nun , and caleb the son of jephunneh , which were of them that searched the land , rent their clothes :
but be ye doers of the word , and not hearers only , deceiving your own selves .
wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness , and receive with meekness the engrafted word , which is able to save your souls .
and if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year , then the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations : it shall not go out in the jubile .
for he beholdeth himself , and goeth his way , and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was .
for if any be a hearer of the word , and not a doer , he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass :
if any man among you seem to be religious , and bridleth not his tongue , but deceiveth his own heart , this man ' s religion is vain .
but whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty , and continueth therein , he being not a forgetful hearer , but a doer of the work , this man shall be blessed in his deed .
but the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold ; for it is their perpetual possession .
but the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country : they may be redeemed , and they shall go out in the jubile .
pure religion and undefiled before god and the father is this , to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction , and to keep himself unspotted from the world .
notwithstanding the cities of the levites , and the houses of the cities of their possession , may the levites redeem at any time .
arab , and dumah , and eshean ,
and goshen , and holon , and giloh ; eleven cities with their villages :
and anab , and eshtemoh , and anim ,
and jezreel , and jokdeam , and zanoah ,
maon , carmel , and ziph , and juttah ,
and humtah , and kirjath - arba , which is hebron , and zior ; nine cities with their villages :
and janum , and beth - tappuah , and aphekah ,
and in the mountains , shamir , and jattir , and socoh ,
and dannah , and kirjath - sannah , which is debir ,
from ekron even unto the sea , all that lay near ashdod , with their villages :
in the wilderness , beth - arabah , middin , and secacah ,
can a man be profitable unto god , as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself ?
kirjath - baal , which is kirjath - jearim , and rabbah ; two cities with their villages :
then eliphaz the temanite answered and said ,
as for the jebusites the inhabitants of jerusalem , the children of judah could not drive them out : but the jebusites dwell with the children of judah at jerusalem unto this day .
will he reprove thee for fear of thee ? will he enter with thee into judgment ?
and nibshan , and the city of salt , and en - gedi ; six cities with their villages .
is it any pleasure to the almighty , that thou art righteous ? or is it gain to him that thou makest thy ways perfect ?
for thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought , and stripped the naked of their clothing .
is not thy wickedness great ? and thine iniquities infinite ?
but as for the mighty man , he had the earth ; and the honourable man dwelt in it .
thou hast not given water to the weary to drink , and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry .
thou has sent widows away empty , and the arms of the fatherless have been broken .
to whom ye forgive any thing , i forgive also : for if i forgave any thing , to whom i forgave it , for your sakes forgave i it in the person of christ ;
lest satan should get an advantage of us : for we are not ignorant of his devices .
cain , gibeah , and timnah ; ten cities with their villages :
furthermore , when i came to troas to preach christ ' s gospel , and a door was opened unto me of the lord ,
halhul , beth - zur , and gedor ,
i had no rest in my spirit , because i found not titus my brother : but taking my leave of them , i went from thence into macedonia .
and maarath , and beth - anoth , and eltekon ; six cities with their villages :
now thanks be unto god , which always causeth us to triumph in christ , and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place .
for we are unto god a sweet savour of christ , in them that are saved , and in them that perish :
to the one we are the savour of death unto death ; and to the other the savour of life unto life . and who is sufficient for these things ?
for we are not as many , which corrupt the word of god : but as of sincerity , but as of god , in the sight of god speak we in christ .
and zanoah , and en - gannim , tappuah , and enam ,
and in the valley , eshtaol , and zoreah , and ashnah ,
and lebaoth , and shilhim , and ain , and rimmon : all the cities are twenty and nine , with their villages :
and ziklag , and madmannah , and sansannah ,
and eltolad , and chesil , and hormah ,
and hazar - shual , and beer - sheba , and bizjothjah ,
baalah , and iim , and azem ,
amam , and shema , and moladah ,
ziph , and telem , and bealoth ,
and hazor , hadattah , and kerioth , and hezron , which is hazor ,
and jiphtah , and ashnah , and nezib ,
and his host , and those that were numbered thereof , were fifty and four thousand and four hundred .
libnah , and ether , and ashan ,
then the tribe of zebulun : and eliab the son of helon shall be captain of the children of zebulun .
ekron , with her towns and her villages :
and his host , and those that were numbered of them , were threescore and fourteen thousand and six hundred .
and keilah , and achzib , and mareshah ; nine cities with their villages :
and those that do pitch next unto him shall be the tribe of issachar : and nethaneel the son of zuar shall be captain of the children of issachar .
and on the east side toward the rising of the sun shall they of the standard of the camp of judah pitch throughout their armies : and nahshon the son of amminadab shall be captain of the children of judah .
and gederoth , beth - dagon , and naamah , and makkedah ; sixteen cities with their villages :
and cabbon , and lahmam , and kithlish ,
and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron , saying ,
and his host , and those that were numbered thereof , were fifty and seven thousand and four hundred .
all that were numbered in the camp of judah were an hundred thousand and fourscore thousand and six thousand and four hundred , throughout their armies . these shall first set forth .
lachish , and bozkath , and eglon ,
jarmuth , and adullam , socoh , and azekah ,
and sharaim , and adithaim , and gederah , and gederothaim ; fourteen cities with their villages :
zenan , and hadashah , and migdal - gad ,
and dilean , and mizpeh , and joktheel ,
and she was in bitterness of soul , and prayed unto the lord , and wept sore .
and it came to pass , as she continued praying before the lord , that eli marked her mouth .
for the lord taketh pleasure in his people : he will beautify the meek with salvation .
let the saints be joyful in glory : let them sing aloud upon their beds .
and eli said unto her , how long wilt thou be drunken ? put away thy wine from thee .
let the high praises of god be in their mouth , and a twoedged sword in their hand ;
now hannah , she spake in her heart ; only her lips moved , but her voice was not heard : therefore eli thought she had been drunken .
to execute vengeance upon the heathen , and punishments upon the people ;
count not thine handmaid for a daughter of belial : for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have i spoken hitherto .
and the border went out unto the side of ekron northward : and the border was drawn to shicron , and passed along to mount baalah , and went out unto jabneel ; and the goings out of the border were at the sea .
to bind their kings with chains , and their nobles with fetters of iron ;
and hannah answered and said , no , my lord , i am a woman of a sorrowful spirit : i have drunk neither wine nor strong drink , but have poured out my soul before the lord .
and the west border was to the great sea , and the coast thereof . this is the coast of the children of judah round about according to their families .
to execute upon them the judgment written : this honour have all his saints . praise ye the lord .
and she said , let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight . so the woman went her way , and did eat , and her countenance was no more sad .
then eli answered and said , go in peace : and the god of israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him .
and the border compassed from baalah westward unto mount seir , and passed along unto the side of mount jearim , which is chesalon , on the north side , and went down to beth - shemesh , and passed on to timnah :
and the second time the cock crew . and peter called to mind the word that jesus said unto him , before the cock crow twice , thou shalt deny me thrice . and when he thought thereon , he wept .
and he denied it again . and a little after , they that stood by said again to peter , surely thou art one of them : for thou art a galilaean , and thy speech agreeth thereto .
but he began to curse and to swear , saying , i know not this man of whom ye speak .
by humility and the fear of the lord are riches , and honour , and life .
a prudent man foreseeth the evil , and hideth himself : but the simple pass on , and are punished .
the rich and poor meet together : the lord is the maker of them all .
a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches , and loving favour rather than silver and gold .
and the man elkanah , and all his house , went up to offer unto the lord the yearly sacrifice , and his vow .
he that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity : and the rod of his anger shall fail .
wherefore it came to pass , when the time was come about after hannah had conceived , that she bare a son , and called his name samuel , saying , because i have asked him of the lord .
the rich ruleth over the poor , and the borrower is servant to the lender .
train up a child in the way he should go : and when he is old , he will not depart from it .
thorns and snares are in the way of the froward : he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them .
and they slew a bullock , and brought the child to eli .
and when she had weaned him , she took him up with her , with three bullocks , and one ephah of flour , and a bottle of wine , and brought him unto the house of the lord in shiloh : and the child was young .
and elkanah her husband said unto her , do what seemeth thee good ; tarry until thou have weaned him ; only the lord establish his word . so the woman abode , and gave her son suck until she weaned him .
but hannah went not up ; for she said unto her husband , i will not go up until the child be weaned , and then i will bring him , that he may appear before the lord , and there abide for ever .
he that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed ; for he giveth of his bread to the poor .
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of judah according to their families .
therefore also i have lent him to the lord ; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the lord . and he worshipped the lord there .
and the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of judah toward the coast of edom southward were kabzeel , and eder , and jagur ,
for this child i prayed ; and the lord hath given me my petition which i asked of him :
and kinah , and dimonah , and adadah ,
and she said , oh my lord , as thy soul liveth , my lord , i am the woman that stood by thee here , praying unto the lord .
and kedesh , and hazor , and ithnan ,
and caleb drove thence the three sons of anak , sheshai , and ahiman , and talmai , the children of anak .
and unto caleb the son of jephunneh he gave a part among the children of judah , according to the commandment of the lord to joshua , even the city of arba the father of anak , which city is hebron .
and they rose up in the morning early , and worshipped before the lord , and returned , and came to their house to ramah : and elkanah knew hannah his wife ; and the lord remembered her .
and caleb said , he that smiteth kirjath - sepher , and taketh it , to him will i give achsah my daughter to wife .
and he went up thence to the inhabitants of debir : and the name of debir before was kirjath - sepher .
and it came to pass , as she came unto him , that she moved him to ask of her father a field : and she lighted off her ass ; and caleb said unto her , what wouldest thou ?
let them praise his name in the dance : let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp .
and othniel the son of kenaz , the brother of caleb , took it : and he gave him achsah his daughter to wife .
let israel rejoice in him that made him : let the children of zion be joyful in their king .
praise ye the lord . sing unto the lord a new song , and his praise in the congregation of saints .
who answered , give me a blessing ; for thou hast given me a south land ; give me also springs of water . and he gave her the upper springs , and the nether springs .
( according as it is written , god hath given them the spirit of slumber , eyes that they should not see , and ears that they should not hear ; ) unto this day .
and david saith , let their table be made a snare , and a trap , and a stumbling block , and a recompence unto them :
and if by grace , then is it no more of works : otherwise grace is no more grace . but if it be of works , then is it no more grace : otherwise work is no more work .
what then ? israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for ; but the election hath obtained it , and the rest were blinded
but what saith the answer of god unto him ? i have reserved to myself seven thousand men , who have not bowed the knee to the image of baal .
even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace .
but neither so did their witness agree together .
we heard him say , i will destroy this temple that is made with hands , and within three days i will build another made without hands .
and there arose certain , and bare false witness against him , saying ,
for many bare false witness against him , but their witness agreed not together .
and the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against jesus to put him to death ; and found none .
and he left the linen cloth , and fled from them naked .
and they led jesus away to the high priest : and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes .
and they all forsook him , and fled .
and there followed him a certain young man , having a linen cloth cast about his naked body ; and the young men laid hold on him :
lord , they have killed thy prophets , and digged down thine altars ; and i am left alone , and they seek my life .
god hath not cast away his people which he foreknew . wot ye not what the scripture saith of elias ? how he maketh intercession to god against israel , saying ,
i say then , hath god cast away his people ? god forbid . for i also am an israelite , of the seed of abraham , of the tribe of benjamin .
but he denied , saying , i know not , neither understand i what thou sayest . and he went out into the porch ; and the cock crew .
and when she saw peter warming himself , she looked upon him , and said , and thou also wast with jesus of nazareth .
and a maid saw him again , and began to say to them that stood by , this is one of them .
then the high priest rent his clothes , and saith , what need we any further witnesses ?
ye have heard the blasphemy : what think ye ? and they all condemned him to be guilty of death .
and it came to pass after many days , that the word of the lord came to elijah in the third year , saying , go , shew thyself unto ahab ; and i will send rain upon the earth .
and some began to spit on him , and to cover his face , and to buffet him , and to say unto him , prophesy : and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands .
and elijah went to shew himself unto ahab . and there was a sore famine in samaria .
and as peter was beneath in the palace , there cometh one of the maids of the high priest :
and ahab called obadiah , which was the governor of his house . ( now obadiah feared the lord greatly :
and the high priest stood up in the midst , and asked jesus , saying , answerest thou nothing ? what is it which these witness against thee ?
but he held his peace , and answered nothing . again the high priest asked him , and said unto him , art thou the christ , the son of the blessed ?
and jesus said , i am : and ye shall see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power , and coming in the clouds of heaven .
and he said , what have i sinned , that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of ahab , to slay me ?
for it was so , when jezebel cut off the prophets of the lord , that obadiah took an hundred prophets , and hid them by fifty in a cave , and fed them with bread and water . )
and ahab said unto obadiah , go into the land , unto all fountains of water , and unto all brooks : peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive , that we lose not all the beasts .
so they divided the land between them to pass throughout it : ahab went one way by himself , and obadiah went another way by himself .
and as obadiah was in the way , behold , elijah met him : and he knew him , and fell on his face , and said , art thou that my lord elijah ?
then he brought me forth into the utter court , the way toward the north : and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place , and which was before the building toward the north .
and before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits breadth inward , a way of one cubit ; and their doors toward the north .
then shall he answer them , saying , verily i say unto you , inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these , ye did it not to me .
now the upper chambers were shorter : for the galleries were higher than these , than the lower , and than the middlemost of the building .
and these shall go away into everlasting punishment : but the righteous into life eternal .
before the length of an hundred cubits was the north door , and the breadth was fifty cubits .
i was a stranger , and ye took me not in : naked , and ye clothed me not : sick , and in prison , and ye visited me not .
over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court , and over against the pavement which was for the utter court , was gallery against gallery in three stories .
he shall feed his flock like a shepherd : he shall gather the lambs with his arm , and carry them in his bosom , and shall gently lead those that are with young .
behold , the lord god will come with strong hand , and his arm shall rule for him : behold , his reward is with him , and his work before him .
out of his nostrils goeth smoke , as out of a seething pot or caldron .
but thou art holy , o thou that inhabitest the praises of israel .
his breath kindleth coals , and a flame goeth out of his mouth .
o my god , i cry in the daytime , but thou hearest not ; and in the night season , and am not silent .
the workman melteth a graven image , and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold , and casteth silver chains .
they cried unto thee , and were delivered : they trusted in thee , and were not confounded .
and lebanon is not sufficient to burn , nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering .
our fathers trusted in thee : they trusted , and thou didst deliver them .
all nations before him are as nothing ; and they are counted to him less than nothing , and vanity .
his heart is as firm as a stone ; yea , as hard as a piece of the nether millstone .
all they that see me laugh me to scorn : they shoot out the lip , they shake the head saying ,
with whom took he counsel , and who instructed him , and taught him in the path of judgment , and taught him knowledge , and shewed to him the way of understanding ?
when he raiseth up himself , the mighty are afraid : by reason of breakings they purify themselves .
but i am a worm , and no man ; a reproach of men , and despised of the people .
behold , the nations are as a drop of a bucket , and are counted as the small dust of the balance : behold , he taketh up the isles as a very little thing .
in his neck remaineth strength , and sorrow is turned into joy before him .
but thou art he that took me out of the womb : thou didst make me hope when i was upon my mother ' s breasts .
who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand , and meted out heaven with the span , and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure , and weighed the mountains in scales , and the hills in a balance ?
the flakes of his flesh are joined together : they are firm in themselves ; they cannot be moved .
he trusted on the lord that he would deliver him : let him deliver him , seeing he delighted in him .
who hath directed the spirit of the lord , or being his counseller hath taught him ?
the arrow cannot make him flee : slingstones are turned with him into stubble .
and from under these chambers was the entry on the east side , as one goeth into them from the utter court .
for i was an hungred , and ye gave me no meat : i was thirsty , and ye gave me no drink :
darts are counted as stubble : he laugheth at the shaking of a spear .
for the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was fifty cubits : and , lo , before the temple were an hundred cubits .
then shall he say also unto them on the left hand , depart from me , ye cursed , into everlasting fire , prepared for the devil and his angels :
the sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold : the spear , the dart , nor the habergeon .
and the wall that was without over against the chambers , toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers , the length thereof was fifty cubits .
and the king shall answer and say unto them , verily i say unto you , inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren , ye have done it unto me .
he esteemeth iron as straw , and brass as rotten wood .
for they were in three stories , but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts : therefore the building was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground .
and thy brethren also of the tribe of levi , the tribe of thy father , bring thou with thee , that they may be joined unto thee , and minister unto thee : but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister before the tabernacle of witness .
and the lord said unto aaron , thou and thy sons and thy father ' s house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary : and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood .
until thy brother ' s anger turn away from thee , and he forget that which thou hast done to him : then i will send , and fetch thee from thence : why should i be deprived also of you both in one day ?
and rebekah said to isaac , i am weary of my life because of the daughters of heth : if jacob take a wife of the daughters of heth , such as these which are of the daughters of the land , what good shall my life do me ?
my god , my god , why hast thou forsaken me ? why art thou so far from helping me , and from the words of my roaring ?
none is so fierce that dare stir him up : who then is able to stand before me ?
who hath prevented me , that i should repay him ? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
i will not conceal his parts , nor his power , nor his comely proportion .
who can discover the face of his garment ? or who can come to him with his double bridle ?
who can open the doors of his face ? his teeth are terrible round about .
and this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold , unto the shaft thereof , unto the flowers thereof , was beaten work : according unto the pattern which the lord had shewed moses , so he made the candlestick .
his scales are his pride , shut up together as with a close seal .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
one is so near to another , that no air can come between them .
speak unto aaron , and say unto him , when thou lightest the lamps , the seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick .
they are joined one to another , they stick together , that they cannot be sundered .
and aaron did so ; he lighted the lamps thereof over against the candlestick , as the lord commanded moses .
by his neesings a light doth shine , and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning .
then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering , even fine flour mingled with oil , and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin offering .
out of his mouth go burning lamps , and sparks of fire leap out .
and thou shalt bring the levites before the tabernacle of the congregation : and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the children of israel together :
take the levites from among the children of israel , and cleanse them .
and thus shalt thou do unto them , to cleanse them : sprinkle water of purifying upon them , and let them shave all their flesh , and let them wash their clothes , and so make themselves clean .
his lord said unto him , well done , good and faithful servant ; thou hast been faithful over a few things , i will make thee ruler over many things : enter thou into the joy of thy lord .
then he which had received the one talent came and said , lord , i knew thee that thou art an hard man , reaping where thou hast not sown , and gathering where thou hast not strawed :
his lord said unto him , well done , thou good and faithful servant : thou hast been faithful over a few things , i will make thee ruler over many things : enter thou into the joy of thy lord .
but sihon trusted not israel to pass through his coast : but sihon gathered all his people together , and pitched in jahaz , and fought against israel .
he also that had received two talents came and said , lord , thou deliveredst unto me two talents : behold , i have gained two other talents beside them .
thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers , and then at my coming i should have received mine own with usury .
take therefore the talent from him , and give it unto him which hath ten talents .
who smote great nations , and slew mighty kings ;
and i was afraid , and went and hid thy talent in the earth : lo , there thou hast that is thine .
sihon king of the amorites , and og king of bashan , and all the kingdoms of canaan :
his lord answered and said unto him , thou wicked and slothful servant , thou knewest that i reap where i sowed not , and gather where i have not strawed :
and gave their land for an heritage , an heritage unto israel his people .
thy name , o lord , endureth for ever ; and thy memorial , o lord , throughout all generations .
for the lord will judge his people , and he will repent himself concerning his servants .
the idols of the heathen are silver and gold , the work of men ' s hands .
they have mouths , but they speak not ; eyes have they , but they see not ;
they have ears , but they hear not ; neither is there any breath in their mouths .
they that make them are like unto them : so is every one that trusteth in them .
bless the lord , o house of israel : bless the lord , o house of aaron :
and israel sent messengers unto sihon king of the amorites , the king of heshbon ; and israel said unto him , let us pass , we pray thee , through thy land into my place .
then they went along through the wilderness , and compassed the land of edom , and the land of moab , and came by the east side of the land of moab , and pitched on the other side of arnon , but came not within the border of moab : for arnon was the border of moab .
and said unto him , thus saith jephthah , israel took not away the land of moab , nor the land of the children of ammon :
and they shall keep thy charge , and the charge of all the tabernacle : only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar , that neither they , nor ye also , die .
and jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of ammon :
and they shall be joined unto thee , and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation , for all the service of the tabernacle : and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you .
then israel sent messengers unto the king of edom , saying , let me , i pray thee , pass through thy land : but the king of edom would not hearken thereto . and in like manner they sent unto the king of moab : but he would not consent : and israel abode in kadesh .
and ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary , and the charge of the altar : that there be no wrath any more upon the children of israel .
but when israel came up from egypt , and walked through the wilderness unto the red sea , and came to kadesh ;
and i , behold , i have taken your brethren the levites from among the children of israel : to you they are given as a gift for the lord , to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation .
then jephthah went with the elders of gilead , and the people made him head and captain over them : and jephthah uttered all his words before the lord in mizpeh .
therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest ' s office for every thing of the altar , and within the vail ; and ye shall serve : i have given your priest ' s office unto you as a service of gift : and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death .
and so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents , saying , lord , thou deliveredst unto me five talents : behold , i have gained beside them five talents more .
and the elders of gilead said unto jephthah , the lord be witness between us , if we do not so according to thy words .
and the lord spake unto aaron , behold , i also have given thee the charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of israel ; unto thee have i given them by reason of the anointing , and to thy sons , by an ordinance for ever .
and the king of the children of ammon answered unto the messengers of jephthah , because israel took away my land , when they came up out of egypt , from arnon even unto jabbok , and unto jordan : now therefore restore those lands again peaceably .
this shall be thine of the most holy things , reserved from the fire : every oblation of theirs , every meat offering of theirs , and every sin offering of theirs , and every trespass offering of theirs , which they shall render unto me , shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons .
and jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of ammon , saying , what hast thou to do with me , that thou art come against me to fight in my land ?
and jephthah vowed a vow unto the lord , and said , if thou shalt without fail deliver the children of ammon into mine hands ,
and the south quarter was from the end of kirjath - jearim , and the border went out on the west , and went out to the well of waters of nephtoah :
and before him shall be gathered all nations : and he shall separate them one from another , as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats :
and the border was drawn thence , and compassed the corner of the sea southward , from the hill that lieth before beth - horon southward ; and the goings out thereof were at kirjath - baal , which is kirjath - jearim , a city of the children of judah : this was the west quarter .
and he shall set the sheep on his right hand , but the goats on the left .
and the border went over from thence toward luz , to the side of luz , which is bethel , southward ; and the border descended to ataroth - adar , near the hill that lieth on the south side of the nether beth - horon .
then shall the king say unto them on his right hand , come , ye blessed of my father , inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world :
and their border on the north side was from jordan ; and the border went up to the side of jericho on the north side , and went up through the mountains westward ; and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness of beth - aven .
for i was an hungred , and ye gave me meat : i was thirsty , and ye gave me drink : i was a stranger , and ye took me in :
and the lot of the tribe of the children of benjamin came up according to their families : and the coast of their lot came forth between the children of judah and the children of joseph .
but there went up a mist from the earth , and watered the whole face of the ground .
naked , and ye clothed me : i was sick , and ye visited me : i was in prison , and ye came unto me .
and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground , and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life ; and man became a living soul .
then shall the righteous answer him , saying , lord , when saw we thee an hungred , and fed thee ? or thirsty , and gave thee drink ?
and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden ; and there he put the man whom he had formed .
when saw we thee a stranger , and took thee in ? or naked , and clothed thee ?
and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight , and good for food ; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden , and the tree of knowledge of good and evil .
or when saw we thee sick , or in prison , and came unto thee ?
upon earth there is not his like , who is made without fear .
he beholdeth all high things : he is a king over all the children of pride .
sharp stones are under him : he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire .
he maketh the deep to boil like a pot : he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment .
then the spirit of the lord came upon jephthah , and he passed over gilead , and manasseh , and passed over mizpeh of gilead , and from mizpeh of gilead he passed over unto the children of ammon .
he maketh a path to shine after him ; one would think the deep to be hoary .
howbeit the king of the children of ammon hearkened not unto the words of jephthah which he sent him .
and god blessed the seventh day , and sanctified it : because that in it he had rested from all his work which god created and made .
wherefore i have not sinned against thee , but thou doest me wrong to war against me : the lord the judge be judge this day between the children of israel and the children of ammon .
and on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made ; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made .
and every plant of the field before it was in the earth , and every herb of the field before it grew : for the lord god had not caused it to rain upon the earth , and there was not a man to till the ground .
and now art thou any thing better than balak the son of zippor , king of moab ? did he ever strive against israel , or did he ever fight against them ,
these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created , in the day that the lord god made the earth and the heavens ,
wilt not thou possess that which chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess ? so whomsoever the lord our god shall drive out from before us , them will we possess .
so now the lord god of israel hath dispossessed the amorites from before his people israel , and shouldest thou possess it ?
and they possessed all the coasts of the amorites , from arnon even unto jabbok , and from the wilderness even unto jordan .
when the son of man shall come in his glory , and all the holy angels with him , then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory :
and the lord god of israel delivered sihon and all his people into the hand of israel , and they smote them : so israel possessed all the land of the amorites , the inhabitants of that country .
and cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children , and the heart of the children to their fathers , lest i come and smite the earth with a curse .
remember ye the law of moses my servant , which i commanded unto him in horeb for all israel , with the statutes and judgments .
and jordan was the border of it on the east side . this was the inheritance of the children of benjamin , by the coasts thereof round about , according to their families .
now the cities of the tribe of the children of benjamin according to their families were jericho , and beth - hoglah , and the valley of keziz ,
and beth - arabah , and zemaraim , and bethel ,
that the daughters of israel went yearly to lament the daughter of jephthah the gileadite four days in a year .
and avim , and parah , and ophrah ,
but unto you that fear my name shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings ; and ye shall go forth , and grow up as calves of the stall .
and chephar - haammonai , and ophni , and gaba ; twelve cities with their villages :
and ye shall tread down the wicked ; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that i shall do this , saith the lord of hosts .
gibeon , and ramah , and beeroth ,
for , behold , the day cometh , that shall burn as an oven ; and all the proud , yea , and all that do wickedly , shall be stubble : and the day that cometh shall burn them up , saith the lord of hosts , that it shall leave them neither root nor branch .
so jephthah passed over unto the children of ammon to fight against them ; and the lord delivered them into his hands .
and was drawn from the north , and went forth to en - shemesh , and went forth toward geliloth , which is over against the going up of adummim , and descended to the stone of bohan the son of reuben ,
and he smote them from aroer , even till thou come to minnith , even twenty cities , and unto the plain of the vineyards , with a very great slaughter . thus the children of ammon were subdued before the children of israel .
and the border came down to the end of the mountain that lieth before the valley of the son of hinnom , and which is in the valley of the giants on the north , and descended to the valley of hinnom , to the side of jebusi on the south , and descended to en - rogel ,
and jephthah came to mizpeh unto his house , and , behold , his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances : and she was his only child ; beside her he had neither son nor daughter .
and the border passed along to the side of beth - hoglah northward : and the outgoings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of jordan : this was the south coast .
and it came to pass , when he saw her , that he rent his clothes , and said , alas , my daughter ! thou hast brought me very low , and thou art one of them that trouble me : for i have opened my mouth unto the lord , and i cannot go back .
and passed along toward the side over against arabah northward , and went down unto arabah :
and she said unto him , my father , if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the lord , do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth ; forasmuch as the lord hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies , even of the children of ammon .
and she said unto her father , let this thing be done for me : let me alone two months , that i may go up and down upon the mountains , and bewail my virginity , i and my fellows .
and he said , go . and he sent her away for two months : and she went with her companions , and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains .
and it came to pass at the end of two months , that she returned unto her father , who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed : and she knew no man . and it was a custom in israel ,
and zelah , eleph , and jebusi , which is jerusalem , gibeath , and kirjath ; fourteen cities with their villages . this is the inheritance of the children of benjamin according to their families .
and rekem , and irpeel , and taralah ,
in those days the multitude being very great , and having nothing to eat , jesus called his disciples unto him , and saith unto them ,
and his disciples answered him , from whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness ?
and he asked them , how many loaves have ye ? and they said , seven .
i have compassion on the multitude , because they have now been with me three days , and have nothing to eat :
and if i send them away fasting to their own houses , they will faint by the way : for divers of them came from far .
god forbid that we should rebel against the lord , and turn this day from following the lord , to build an altar for burnt offerings , for meat offerings , or for sacrifices , beside the altar of the lord our god that is before his tabernacle .
so they did eat , and were filled : and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets .
and they that had eaten were about four thousand : and he sent them away .
and he commanded the people to sit down on the ground : and he took the seven loaves , and gave thanks , and brake , and gave to his disciples to set before them ; and they did set them before the people .
and they had a few small fishes : and he blessed , and commanded to set them also before them .
for the lord hath made jordan a border between us and you , ye children of reuben and children of gad ; ye have no part in the lord : so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the lord .
and if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing , saying , in time to come your children might speak unto our children , saying , what have ye to do with the lord god of israel ?
therefore we said , let us now prepare to build us an altar , not for burnt offering , nor for sacrifice :
then the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh answered , and said unto the heads of the thousands of israel ,
did not achan the son of zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing , and wrath fell on all the congregation of israel ? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity .
that we have built us an altar to turn from following the lord , or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering , or if to offer peace offerings thereon , let the lord himself require it ;
the lord god of gods , the lord god of gods , he knoweth , and israel he shall know ; if it be in rebellion , or if in transgression against the lord , ( save us not this day , )
wherefore , brethren , look ye out among you seven men of honest report , full of the holy ghost and wisdom , whom we may appoint over this business .
then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them , and said , it is not reason that we should leave the word of god , and serve tables .
and in those days , when the number of the disciples was multiplied , there arose a murmuring of the grecians against the hebrews , because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration .
and when phinehas the priest , and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of israel which were with him , heard the words that the children of reuben and the children of gad and the children of manasseh spake , it pleased them .
and the word of god increased ; and the number of the disciples multiplied in jerusalem greatly ; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith .
whom they set before the apostles : and when they had prayed , they laid their hands on them .
and the saying pleased the whole multitude : and they chose stephen , a man full of faith and of the holy ghost , and philip , and prochorus , and nicanor , and timon , and parmenas , and nicolas a proselyte of antioch :
but we will give ourselves continually to prayer , and to the ministry of the word .
then there arose certain of the synagogue , which is called the synagogue of the libertines , and cyrenians , and alexandrians , and of them of cilicia and of asia , disputing with stephen .
our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers : the snare is broken , and we are escaped .
and stephen , full of faith and power , did great wonders and miracles among the people .
our help is in the name of the lord , who made heaven and earth .
if it had not been the lord who was on our side , when men rose up against us :
if it had not been the lord who was on our side , now may israel say ;
then the waters had overwhelmed us , the stream had gone over our soul :
then they had swallowed us up quick , when their wrath was kindled against us :
but that ye must turn away this day from following the lord ? and it will be , seeing ye rebel to day against the lord , that to morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of israel .
blessed be the lord , who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth .
is the iniquity of peor too little for us , from which we are not cleansed until this day , although there was a plague in the congregation of the lord ,
thus saith the whole congregation of the lord , what trespass is this that ye have committed against the god of israel , to turn away this day from following the lord , in that ye have builded you an altar , that ye might rebel this day against the lord ?
and they came unto the children of reuben , and to the children of gad , and to the half tribe of manasseh , unto the land of gilead , and they spake with them , saying ,
and with him ten princes , of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of israel ; and each one was an head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of israel .
and the children of israel sent unto the children of reuben , and to the children of gad , and to the half tribe of manasseh , into the land of gilead , phinehas the son of eleazar the priest ,
and when the children of israel heard of it , the whole congregation of the children of israel gathered themselves together at shiloh , to go up to war against them .
and the children of israel heard say , behold , the chidren of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh have built an altar over against the land of canaan , in the borders of jordan , at the passage of the children of israel .
and when they came unto the borders of jordan , that are in the land of canaan , the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh built there an altar by jordan , a great altar to see to .
and the philistines followed hard upon saul and upon his sons ; and the philistines slew jonathan , and abinadab , and malchi - shua , saul ' s sons .
now the philistines fought against israel : and the men of israel fled from before the philistines , and fell down slain in mount gilboa .
then said saul unto his armourbearer , draw thy sword , and thrust me through therewith ; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through , and abuse me . but his armourbearer would not ; for he was sore afraid . therefore saul took a sword , and fell upon it .
and the battle went sore against saul , and the archers hit him ; and he was sore wounded of the archers .
and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name , that will i do , that the father may be glorified in the son .
if ye shall ask any thing in my name , i will do it .
believe me that i am in the father , and the father in me : or else believe me for the very works ' sake .
verily , verily , i say unto you , he that believeth on me , the works that i do shall he do also ; and greater works than these shall he do ; because i go unto my father .
believest thou not that i am in the father , and the father in me ? the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself : but the father that dwelleth in me , he doeth the works .
yet a little while , and the world seeth me no more ; but ye see me : because i live , ye shall live also .
even the spirit of truth ; whom the world cannot receive , because it seeth him not , neither knoweth him : but ye know him ; for he dwelleth with you , and shall be in you .
i will not leave you comfortless : i will come to you .
if ye love me , keep my commandments .
and i will pray the father , and he shall give you another comforter , that he may abide with you for ever ;
and they cut off his head , and stripped off his armour , and sent into the land of the philistines round about , to publish it in the house of their idols , and among the people .
so saul died , and his three sons , and his armourbearer , and all his men , that same day together .
and when his armourbearer saw that saul was dead , he fell likewise upon his sword , and died with him .
and it came to pass on the morrow , when the philistines came to strip the slain , that they found saul and his three sons fallen in mount gilboa .
and when the men of israel that were on the other side of the valley , and they that were on the other side jordan , saw that the men of israel fled , and that saul and his sons were dead , they forsook the cities , and fled ; and the philistines came and dwelt in them .
but that the world may know that i love the father ; and as the father gave me commandment , even so i do . arise , let us go hence .
hereafter i will not talk much with you : for the prince of this world cometh , and hath nothing in me .
that which is crooked cannot be made straight : and that which is wanting cannot be numbered .
i communed with mine own heart , saying , lo , i am come to great estate , and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in jerusalem : yea , my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge .
at that day ye shall know that i am in my father , and ye in me , and i in you .
and i gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven : this sore travail hath god given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith .
he that hath my commandments , and keepeth them , he it is that loveth me : and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father , and i will love him , and will manifest myself to him .
i have seen all the works that are done under the sun ; and , behold , all is vanity and vexation of spirit .
judas saith unto him , not iscariot , lord , how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us , and not unto the world ?
there is no remembrance of former things ; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after .
jesus answered and said unto him , if a man love me , he will keep my words : and my father will love him , and we will come unto him , and make our abode with him .
i the preacher was king over israel in jerusalem .
he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings : and the word which ye hear is not mine , but the father ' s which sent me .
these things have i spoken unto you , being yet present with you .
is there any thing whereof it may be said , see , this is new ? it hath been already of old time , which was before us .
but the comforter , which is the holy ghost , whom the father will send in my name , he shall teach you all things , and bring all things to your remembrance , whatsoever i have said unto you .
peace i leave with you , my peace i give unto you : not as the world giveth , give i unto you . let not your heart be troubled , neither let it be afraid .
ye have heard how i said unto you , i go away , and come again unto you . if ye loved me , ye would rejoice , because i said , i go unto the father : for my father is greater than i .
and now i have told you before it come to pass , that , when it is come to pass , ye might believe .
and i gave my heart to know wisdom , and to know madness and folly : i perceived that this also is vexation of spirit .
for in much wisdom is much grief : and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow .
therefore thou shalt devour men no more , neither bereave thy nations any more , saith the lord god .
neither will i cause men to hear in thee the shame of the heathen any more , neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people any more , neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more , saith the lord god .
moreover the word of the lord came unto me , saying ,
but the lord is in his holy temple : let all the earth keep silence before him .
son of man , when the house of israel dwelt in their own land , they defiled it by their own way and by their doings : their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman .
and i will multiply men upon you , all the house of israel , even all of it : and the cities shall be inhabited , and the wastes shall be builded :
and i will multiply upon you man and beast ; and they shall increase and bring fruit : and i will settle you after your old estates , and will do better unto you than at your beginnings : and ye shall know that i am the lord .
yea , i will cause men to walk upon you , even my people israel ; and they shall possess thee , and thou shalt be their inheritance , and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of men .
thus saith the lord god ; because they say unto you , thou land devourest up men , and hast bereaved thy nations ;
the third captain of the host for the third month was benaiah the son of jehoiada , a chief priest : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .
wherefore i poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land , and for their idols wherewith they had polluted it :
this is that benaiah , who was mighty among the thirty , and above the thirty : and in his course was ammizabad his son .
and i scattered them among the heathen , and they were dispersed through the countries : according to their way and according to their doings i judged them .
the fourth captain for the fourth month was asahel the brother of joab , and zebadiah his son after him : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .
the fifth captain for the fifth month was shamhuth the izrahite : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .
over the first course for the first month was jashobeam the son of zabdiel : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .
and over the course of the second month was dodai an ahohite , and of his course was mikloth also the ruler : in his course likewise were twenty and four thousand .
of the children of perez was the chief of all the captains of the host for the first month .
and when they entered unto the heathen , whither they went , they profaned my holy name , when they said to them , these are the people of the lord , and are gone forth out of his land .
and i will put my spirit within you , and cause you to walk in my statutes , and ye shall keep my judgments , and do them .
and ye shall dwell in the land that i gave to your fathers ; and ye shall be my people , and i will be your god .
then will i sprinkle clean water upon you , and ye shall be clean : from all your filthiness , and from all your idols , will i cleanse you .
a new heart also will i give you , and a new spirit will i put within you : and i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh , and i will give you an heart of flesh .
and i will sanctify my great name , which was profaned among the heathen , which ye have profaned in the midst of them ; and the heathen shall know that i am the lord , saith the lord god , when i shall be sanctified in you before their eyes .
for i will take you from among the heathen , and gather you out of all countries , and will bring you into your own land .
woe to him that buildeth a town with blood , and stablisheth a city by iniquity !
but i had pity for mine holy name , which the house of israel had profaned among the heathen , whither they went .
for the stone shall cry out of the wall , and the beam out of the timber shall answer it .
therefore say unto the house of israel , thus saith the lord god ; i do not this for your sakes , o house of israel , but for mine holy name ' s sake , which ye have profaned among the heathen , whither ye went .
thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people , and hast sinned against thy soul .
i will also save you from all your uncleannesses : and i will call for the corn , and will increase it , and lay no famine upon you .
after a long time the lord of those servants cometh , and reckoneth with them .
but he that had received one went and digged in the earth , and hid his lord ' s money .
then shall ye remember your own evil ways , and your doings that were not good , and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations .
and likewise he that had received two , he also gained other two .
and i will multiply the fruit of the tree , and the increase of the field , that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen .
for the violence of lebanon shall cover thee , and the spoil of beasts , which made them afraid , because of men ' s blood , and for the violence of the land , of the city , and of all that dwell therein .
then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same , and made them other five talents .
for the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the lord , as the waters cover the sea .
and unto one he gave five talents , to another two , and to another one ; to every man according to his several ability ; and straightway took his journey .
for the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country , who called his own servants , and delivered unto them his goods .
watch therefore , for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh .
but he answered and said , verily i say unto you , i know you not .
what profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it ; the molten image , and a teacher of lies , that the maker of his work trusteth therein , to make dumb idols ?
afterward came also the other virgins , saying , lord , lord , open to us .
woe unto him that saith to the wood , awake ; to the dumb stone , arise , it shall teach ! behold , it is laid over with gold and silver , and there is no breath at all in the midst of it .
and while they went to buy , the bridegroom came ; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage : and the door was shut .
and kore the son of imnah the levite , the porter toward the east , was over the freewill offerings of god , to distribute the oblations of the lord , and the most holy things .
and next him were eden , and miniamin , and jeshua , and shemaiah , amariah , and shecaniah , in the cities of the priests , in their set office , to give to their brethren by courses , as well to the great as to the small :
beside their genealogy of males , from three years old and upward , even unto every one that entereth into the house of the lord , his daily portion for their service in their charges according to their courses ;
both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers , and the levites from twenty years old and upward , in their charges by their courses ;
and to the genealogy of all their little ones , their wives , and their sons , and their daughters , through all the congregation : for in their set office they sanctified themselves in holiness :
also of the sons of aaron the priests , which were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities , in every several city , the men that were expressed by name , to give portions to all the males among the priests , and to all that were reckoned by genealogies among the levites .
then hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the lord ; and they prepared them ,
and jehiel , and azaziah , and nahath , and asahel , and jerimoth , and jozabad , and eliel , and ismachiah , and mahath , and benaiah , were overseers under the hand of cononiah and shimei his brother , at the commandment of hezekiah the king , and azariah the ruler of the house of god .
and brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully : over which cononiah the levite was ruler , and shimei his brother was the next .
and thus did hezekiah throughout all judah , and wrought that which was good and right and truth before the lord his god .
and in every work that he began in the service of the house of god , and in the law , and in the commandments , to seek his god , he did it with all his heart , and prospered .
nebuchadnezzar the king , unto all people , nations , and languages , that dwell in all the earth ; peace be multiplied unto you .
i thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high god hath wrought toward me .
but at the last daniel came in before me , whose name was belteshazzar , according to the name of my god , and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods : and before him i told the dream , saying ,
then came in the magicians , the astrologers , the chaldeans , and the soothsayers : and i told the dream before them ; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof .
o belteshazzar , master of the magicians , because i know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee , and no secret troubleth thee , tell me the visions of my dream that i have seen , and the interpretation thereof .
i nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house , and flourishing in my palace :
how great are his signs ! and how mighty are his wonders ! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom , and his dominion is from generation to generation .
the morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up , and lose thy sweet words .
therefore made i a decree to bring in all the wise men of babylon before me , that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream .
speak not in the ears of a fool : for he will despise the wisdom of thy words .
i saw a dream which made me afraid , and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me .
eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye , neither desire thou his dainty meats :
for as he thinketh in his heart , so is he : eat and drink , saith he to thee ; but his heart is not with thee .
labour not to be rich : cease from thine own wisdom .
wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not ? for riches certainly make themselves wings ; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven .
and put a knife to thy throat , if thou be a man given to appetite .
be not desirous of his dainties : for they are deceitful meat .
when thou sittest to eat with a ruler , consider diligently what is before thee :
and when he saw that , he arose , and went for his life , and came to beer - sheba , which belongeth to judah , and left his servant there .
and he looked , and , behold , there was a cake baken on the coals , and a cruse of water at his head . and he did eat and drink , and laid him down again .
and as he lay and slept under a juniper tree , behold , then an angel touched him , and said unto him , arise and eat .
and he arose , and did eat and drink , and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto horeb the mount of god .
and the angel of the lord came again the second time , and touched him , and said , arise and eat ; because the journey is too great for thee .
and he came thither unto a cave , and lodged there ; and , behold , the word of the lord came to him , and he said unto him , what doest thou here , elijah ?
then jezebel sent a messenger unto elijah , saying , so let the gods do to me , and more also , if i make not thy life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time .
and ahab told jezebel all that elijah had done , and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword .
i beseech you therefore , brethren , by the mercies of god , that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice , holy , acceptable unto god , which is your reasonable service .
and be not conformed to this world : but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind , that ye may prove what is that good , and acceptable , and perfect , will of god .
having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us , whether prophecy , let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith ;
so we , being many , are one body in christ , and every one members one of another .
as the holy flock , as the flock of jerusalem in her solemn feasts ; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men : and they shall know that i am the lord .
for as we have many members in one body , and all members have not the same office :
thus saith the lord god ; i will yet for this be inquired of by the house of israel , to do it for them ; i will increase them with men like a flock .
for i say , through the grace given unto me , to every man that is among you , not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think ; but to think soberly , according as god hath dealt to every man the measure of faith .
then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that i the lord build the ruined places , and plant that that was desolate : i the lord have spoken it , and i will do it .
and they shall say , this land that was desolate is become like the garden of eden ; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced , and are inhabited .
let love be without dissimulation . abhor that which is evil ; cleave to that which is good .
and the desolate land shall be tilled , whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by .
or he that exhorteth , on exhortation : he that giveth , let him do it with simplicity ; he that ruleth , with diligence ; he that sheweth mercy , with cheerfulness .
thus saith the lord god ; in the day that i shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities i will also cause you to dwell in the cities , and the wastes shall be builded .
or ministry , let us wait on our ministering : or he that teacheth , on teaching ;
not for your sakes do i this , saith the lord god , be it known unto you : be ashamed and confounded for your own ways , o house of israel .
behold , i go forward , but he is not there ; and backward , but i cannot perceive him :
on the left hand , where he doth work , but i cannot behold him : he hideth himself on the right hand , that i cannot see him :
i would know the words which he would answer me , and understand what he would say unto me .
will he plead against me with his great power ? no ; but he would put strength in me .
there the righteous might dispute with him ; so should i be delivered for ever from my judge .
then job answered and said ,
even to day is my complaint bitter : my stroke is heavier than my groaning .
oh that i knew where i might find him ! that i might come even to his seat !
three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the lord god .
and the feast of harvest , the firstfruits of thy labours , which thou hast sown in the field : and the feast of ingathering , which is in the end of the year , when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field .
the first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the lord thy god . thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother ' s milk .
and let the priests also , which come near to the lord , sanctify themselves , lest the lord break forth upon them .
six days thou shalt do thy work , and on the seventh day thou shalt rest : that thine ox and thine ass may rest , and the son of thy handmaid , and the stranger , may be refreshed .
and moses said unto the lord , the people cannot come up to mount sinai : for thou chargedst us , saying , set bounds about the mount , and sanctify it .
thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread : ( thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days , as i commanded thee , in the time appointed of the month abib ; for in it thou camest out from egypt : and none shall appear before me empty : )
and the lord said unto him , away , get thee down , and thou shalt come up , thou , and aaron with thee : but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the lord , lest he break forth upon them .
three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year .
so moses went down unto the people , and spake unto them .
and the lord came down upon mount sinai , on the top of the mount : and the lord called moses up to the top of the mount ; and moses went up .
and the lord said unto moses , go down , charge the people , lest they break through unto the lord to gaze , and many of them perish .
and six years thou shalt sow thy land , and shalt gather in the fruits thereof :
but the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still ; that the poor of thy people may eat : and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat . in like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard , and with thy oliveyard .
there shall not an hand touch it , but he shall surely be stoned , or shot through ; whether it be beast or man , it shall not live : when the trumpet soundeth long , they shall come up to the mount .
and moses went down from the mount unto the people , and sanctified the people ; and they washed their clothes .
and be ready against the third day : for the third day the lord will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount sinai .
and thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about , saying , take heed to yourselves , that ye go not up into the mount , or touch the border of it : whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death :
and moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with god ; and they stood at the nether part of the mount .
and mount sinai was altogether on a smoke , because the lord descended upon it in fire : and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace , and the whole mount quaked greatly .
and he said unto the people , be ready against the third day : come not at your wives .
and it came to pass on the third day in the morning , that there were thunders and lightnings , and a thick cloud upon the mount , and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud ; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled .
and the lord said unto moses , go unto the people , and sanctify them to day and to morrow , and let them wash their clothes ,
and when the voice of the trumpet sounded long , and waxed louder and louder , moses spake , and god answered him by a voice .
and it shall come to pass , that he that is left in zion , and he that remaineth in jerusalem , shall be called holy , even every one that is written among the living in jerusalem :
when the lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of zion , and shall have purged the blood of jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment , and by the spirit of burning .
and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man , saying , we will eat our own bread , and wear our own apparel : only let us be called by thy name , to take away our reproach .
in that day shall the branch of the lord be beautiful and glorious , and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of israel .
and there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the heat , and for a place of refuge , and for a covert from storm and from rain .
his breath goeth forth , he returneth to his earth ; in that very day his thoughts perish .
happy is he that hath the god of jacob for his help , whose hope is in the lord his god :
which made heaven , and earth , the sea , and all that therein is : which keepeth truth for ever :
praise ye the lord . praise the lord , o my soul .
while i live will i praise the lord : i will sing praises unto my god while i have any being .
the lord preserveth the strangers ; he relieveth the fatherless and widow : but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down .
which executeth judgment for the oppressed : which giveth food to the hungry . the lord looseth the prisoners :
paul , and silvanus , and timotheus , unto the church of the thessalonians which is in god the father and in the lord jesus christ : grace be unto you , and peace , from god our father , and the lord jesus christ .
we give thanks to god always for you all , making mention of you in our prayers ;
remembering without ceasing your work of faith , and labour of love , and patience of hope in our lord jesus christ , in the sight of god and our father ;
knowing , brethren beloved , your election of god .
for our gospel came not unto you in word only , but also in power , and in the holy ghost , and in much assurance ; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake .
and ye became followers of us , and of the lord , having received the word in much affliction , with joy of the holy ghost :
so that ye were ensamples to all that believe in macedonia and achaia .
for from you sounded out the word of the lord not only in macedonia and achaia , but also in every place your faith to god - ward is spread abroad ; so that we need not to speak any thing .
for they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you , and how ye turned to god from idols to serve the living and true god ;
but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden , god hath said , ye shall not eat of it , neither shall ye touch it , lest ye die .
and the serpent said unto the woman , ye shall not surely die :
now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the lord god had made . and he said unto the woman , yea , hath god said , ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden ?
and the woman said unto the serpent , we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden :
for , behold , i will shake mine hand upon them , and they shall be a spoil to their servants : and ye shall know that the lord of hosts hath sent me .
for thus saith the lord of hosts ; after the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you : for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye .
deliver thyself , o zion , that dwellest with the daughter of babylon .
ho , ho , come forth , and flee from the land of the north , saith the lord : for i have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven , saith the lord .
for i , saith the lord , will be unto her a wall of fire round about , and will be the glory in the midst of her .
and said unto him , run , speak to this young man , saying , jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein :
and , behold , the angel that talked with me went forth , and another angel went out to meet him ,
then said i , whither goest thou ? and he said unto me , to measure jerusalem , to see what is the breadth thereof , and what is the length thereof .
i lifted up mine eyes again , and looked , and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand .
and while they abode in galilee , jesus said unto them , the son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men :
and they shall kill him , and the third day he shall be raised again . and they were exceeding sorry .
and jesus said unto them , because of your unbelief : for verily i say unto you , if ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed , ye shall say unto this mountain , remove hence to yonder place ; and it shall remove ; and nothing shall be impossible unto you .
howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting .
notwithstanding , lest we should offend them , go thou to the sea , and cast an hook , and take up the fish that first cometh up ; and when thou hast opened his mouth , thou shalt find a piece of money : that take , and give unto them for me and thee .
peter saith unto him , of strangers . jesus saith unto him , then are the children free .
he saith , yes . and when he was come into the house , jesus prevented him , saying , what thinkest thou , simon ? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute ? of their own children , or of strangers ?
and when they were come to capernaum , they that received tribute money came to peter , and said , doth not your master pay tribute ?
and i said , what shall i do , lord ? and the lord said unto me , arise , and go into damascus ; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do .
and one ananias , a devout man according to the law , having a good report of all the jews which dwelt there ,
and he said , the god of our fathers hath chosen thee , that thou shouldest know his will , and see that just one , and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth .
came unto me , and stood , and said unto me , brother saul , receive thy sight . and the same hour i looked up upon him .
and now why tarriest thou ? arise , and be baptized , and wash away thy sins , calling on the name of the lord .
for thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard .
and the lord god called unto adam , and said unto him , where art thou ?
and saw him saying unto me , make haste , and get thee quickly out of jerusalem : for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me .
and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in the cool of the day : and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god amongst the trees of the garden .
bless the lord , o house of levi : ye that fear the lord , bless the lord .
and it came to pass , that , when i was come again to jerusalem , even while i prayed in the temple , i was in a trance ;
and the eyes of them both were opened , and they knew that they were naked ; and they sewed fig leaves together , and made themselves aprons .
and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food , and that it was pleasant to the eyes , and a tree to be desired to make one wise , she took of the fruit thereof , and did eat , and gave also unto her husband with her ; and he did eat .
and i said , lord , they know that i imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee :
for god doth know that in the day ye eat thereof , then your eyes shall be opened , and ye shall be as gods , knowing good and evil .
blessed be the lord out of zion , which dwelleth at jerusalem . praise ye the lord .
and moses laid up the rods before the lord in the tabernacle of witness .
and moses spake unto the children of israel , and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece , for each prince one , according to their fathers ' houses , even twelve rods : and the rod of aaron was among their rods .
and it shall come to pass , that the man ' s rod , whom i shall choose , shall blossom : and i will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of israel , whereby they murmur against you .
a reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool .
and thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony , where i will meet with you .
an evil man seeketh only rebellion : therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him .
let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man , rather than a fool in his folly .
whoso rewardeth evil for good , evil shall not depart from his house .
and moses brought out all the rods from before the lord unto all the children of israel : and they looked , and took every man his rod .
the beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water : therefore leave off contention , before it be meddled with .
and it came to pass , that on the morrow moses went into the tabernacle of witness ; and , behold , the rod of aaron for the house of levi was budded , and brought forth buds , and bloomed blossoms , and yielded almonds .
he that justifieth the wicked , and he that condemneth the just , even they both are abomination to the lord .
and as they cried out , and cast off their clothes , and threw dust into the air ,
and they gave him audience unto this word , and then lifted up their voices , and said , away with such a fellow from the earth : for it is not fit that he should live .
and he said unto me , depart : for i will send thee far hence unto the gentiles .
and when the blood of thy martyr stephen was shed , i also was standing by , and consenting unto his death , and kept the raiment of them that slew him .
then the chief captain came , and said unto him , tell me , art thou a roman ? he said , yea .
when the centurion heard that , he went and told the chief captain , saying , take heed what thou doest : for this man is a roman .
and as they bound him with thongs , paul said unto the centurion that stood by , is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a roman , and uncondemned ?
the chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle , and bade that he should be examined by scourging ; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him .
then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him : and the chief captain also was afraid , after he knew that he was a roman , and because he had bound him .
and the chief captain answered , with a great sum obtained i this freedom . and paul said , but i was free born .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
a foolish son is a grief to his father , and bitterness to her that bare him .
and they brought their offering before the lord , six covered wagons , and twelve oxen ; a wagon for two of the princes , and for each one an ox : and they brought them before the tabernacle .
also to punish the just is not good , nor to strike princes for equity .
and moses took the wagons and the oxen , and gave them unto the levites .
a wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment .
take it of them , that they may be to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation ; and thou shalt give them unto the levites , to every man according to his service .
wisdom is before him that hath understanding ; but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth .
and four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of merari , according unto their service , under the hand of ithamar the son of aaron the priest .
he that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow : and the father of a fool hath no joy .
two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of gershon , according to their service :
a merry heart doeth good like a medicine : but a broken spirit drieth the bones .
but unto the sons of kohath he gave none : because the service of the sanctuary belonging unto them was that they should bear upon their shoulders .
he that hath a froward heart findeth no good : and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief .
and mephibosheth had a young son , whose name was micha . and all that dwelt in the house of ziba were servants unto mephibosheth .
so mephibosheth dwelt in jerusalem : for he did eat continually at the king ' s table ; and was lame on both his feet .
that the princes of israel , heads of the house of their fathers , who were the princes of the tribes , and were over them that were numbered , offered :
and it came to pass on the day that moses had fully set up the tabernacle , and had anointed it , and sanctified it , and all the instruments thereof , both the altar and all the vessels thereof , and had anointed them , and sanctified them ;
then said ziba unto the king , according to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant , so shall thy servant do . as for mephibosheth , said the king , he shall eat at my table , as one of the king ' s sons .
on the morrow , because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the jews , he loosed him from his bands , and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear , and brought paul down , and set him before them .
he loveth transgression that loveth strife : and he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction .
a man void of understanding striketh hands , and becometh surety in the presence of his friend .
a friend loveth at all times , and a brother is born for adversity .
wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom , seeing he hath no heart to it ?
and his disciples asked him , saying , why then say the scribes that elias must first come ?
and jesus answered and said unto them , elias truly shall first come , and restore all things .
but i say unto you , that elias is come already , and they knew him not , but have done unto him whatsoever they listed . likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them .
and jesus rebuked the devil ; and he departed out of him : and the child was cured from that very hour .
then jesus answered and said , o faithless and perverse generation , how long shall i be with you ? how long shall i suffer you ? bring him hither to me .
then came the disciples to jesus apart , and said , why could not we cast him out ?
and when they were come to the multitude , there came to him a certain man , kneeling down to him , and saying ,
then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of john the baptist .
even a fool , when he holdeth his peace , is counted wise : and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding .
he that hath knowledge spareth his words : and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit .
and he said unto him , i will not go ; but i will depart to mine own land , and to my kindred .
and he said , leave us not , i pray thee ; forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness , and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes .
and it shall be , if thou go with us , yea , it shall be , that what goodness the lord shall do unto us , the same will we do unto thee .
and they departed from the mount of the lord three days ' journey : and the ark of the covenant of the lord went before them in the three days ' journey , to search out a resting place for them .
and it came to pass , when the ark set forward , that moses said , rise up , lord , and let thine enemies be scattered ; and let them that hate thee flee before thee .
and when it rested , he said , return , o lord , unto the many thousands of israel .
the lord render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness : for the lord delivered thee into my hand to day , but i would not stretch forth mine hand against the lord ' s anointed .
and , behold , as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes , so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the lord , and let him deliver me out of all tribulation .
then saul said to david , blessed be thou , my son david : thou shalt both do great things , and also shalt still prevail . so david went on his way , and saul returned to his place .
now therefore , let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the lord : for the king of israel is come out to seek a flea , as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains .
and david answered and said , behold the king ' s spear ! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it .
then said saul , i have sinned : return , my son david : for i will no more do thee harm , because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day : behold , i have played the fool , and have erred exceedingly .
surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life : and i will dwell in the house of the lord for ever .
and over the host of the tribe of the children of naphtali was ahira the son of enan .
thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies : thou anointest my head with oil ; my cup runneth over .
and moses said unto hobab , the son of raguel the midianite , moses ' father in law , we are journeying unto the place of which the lord said , i will give it you : come thou with us , and we will do thee good : for the lord hath spoken good concerning israel .
he maketh me to lie down in green pastures : he leadeth me beside the still waters .
the lord is my shepherd ; i shall not want .
yea , though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death , i will fear no evil : for thou art with me ; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me .
he restoreth my soul : he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name ' s sake .
and the kohathites set forward , bearing the sanctuary : and the other did set up the tabernacle against they came .
when it shall hail , coming down on the forest ; and the city shall be low in a low place .
and the standard of the camp of the children of ephraim set forward according to their armies : and over his host was elishama the son of ammihud .
and over the host of the tribe of the children of gad was eliasaph the son of deuel .
until the spirit be poured upon us from on high , and the wilderness be a fruitful field , and the fruitful field be counted for a forest .
and over the host of the tribe of the children of asher was pagiel the son of ocran .
then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness , and righteousness remain in the fruitful field .
and over the host of the tribe of the children of manasseh was gamaliel the son of pedahzur .
and the work of righteousness shall be peace ; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever .
and my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation , and in sure dwellings , and in quiet resting places ;
this thing is not good that thou hast done . as the lord liveth , ye are worthy to die , because ye have not kept your master , the lord ' s anointed . and now see where the king ' s spear is , and the cruse of water that was at his bolster .
and saul knew david ' s voice , and said , is this thy voice , my son david ? and david said , it is my voice , my lord , o king .
and thou shalt write aaron ' s name upon the rod of levi : for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers .
and david said to abner , art not thou a valiant man ? and who is like to thee in israel ? wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king ? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord .
speak unto the children of israel , and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of their fathers , of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods : write thou every man ' s name upon his rod .
so david took the spear and the cruse of water from saul ' s bolster ; and they gat them away , and no man saw it , nor knew it , neither awaked : for they were all asleep ; because a deep sleep from the lord was fallen upon them .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
then david went over to the other side , and stood on the top of an hill afar off ; a great space being between them :
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
the lord forbid that i should stretch forth mine hand against the lord ' s anointed : but , i pray thee , take thou now the spear that is at his bolster , and the cruse of water , and let us go .
and those men said unto him , we are defiled by the dead body of a man : wherefore are we kept back , that we may not offer an offering of the lord in his appointed season among the children of israel ?
and when all jabesh - gilead heard all that the philistines had done to saul ,
david said furthermore , as the lord liveth , the lord shall smite him ; or his day shall come to die ; or he shall descend into battle , and perish .
and moses said unto them , stand still , and i will hear what the lord will command concerning you .
and they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of sinai : according to all that the lord commanded moses , so did the children of israel .
and there were certain men , who were defiled by the dead body of a man , that they could not keep the passover on that day : and they came before moses and before aaron on that day :
and inquired not of the lord : therefore he slew him , and turned the kingdom unto david the son of jesse .
in the fourteenth day of this month , at even , ye shall keep it in his appointed season : according to all the rites of it , and according to all the ceremonies thereof , shall ye keep it .
and moses spake unto the children of israel , that they should keep the passover .
they arose , all the valiant men , and took away the body of saul , and the bodies of his sons , and brought them to jabesh , and buried their bones under the oak in jabesh , and fasted seven days .
and the lord spake unto moses in the wilderness of sinai , in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of egypt , saying ,
so saul died for his transgression which he committed against the lord , even against the word of the lord , which he kept not , and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit , to inquire of it ;
let the children of israel also keep the passover at his appointed season .
and over the host of the tribe of the children of simeon was shelumiel the son of zurishaddai .
they shall lament for the teats , for the pleasant fields , for the fruitful vine .
and the standard of the camp of reuben set forward according to their armies : and over his host was elizur the son of shedeur .
tremble , ye women that are at ease ; be troubled , ye careless ones : strip you , and make you bare , and gird sackcloth upon your loins .
and the tabernacle was taken down ; and the sons of gershon and the sons of merari set forward , bearing the tabernacle .
because the palaces shall be forsaken ; the multitude of the city shall be left ; the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever , a joy of wild asses , a pasture of flocks ;
and over the host of the tribe of the children of zebulun was eliab the son of helon .
upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers ; yea , upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city :
many days and years shall ye be troubled , ye careless women : for the vintage shall fail , the gathering shall not come .
and the children of israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of sinai ; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of paran .
and they first took their journey according to the commandment of the lord by the hand of moses .
in the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of judah according to their armies : and over his host was nahshon the son of amminadab .
and over the host of the tribe of the children of issachar was nethaneel the son of zuar .
and esau said , behold , i am at the point to die : and what profit shall this birthright do to me ?
and jacob said , swear to me this day ; and he sware unto him : and he sold his birthright unto jacob .
then jacob gave esau bread and pottage of lentiles ; and he did eat and drink , and rose up , and went his way : thus esau despised his birthright .
and it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month , in the second year , that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony .
blessed are ye that sow beside all waters , that send forth thither the feet of the ox and the ass .
and the boys grew : and esau was a cunning hunter , a man of the field ; and jacob was a plain man , dwelling in tents .
and isaac loved esau , because he did eat of his venison : but rebekah loved jacob .
and after that came his brother out , and his hand took hold on esau ' s heel ; and his name was called jacob : and isaac was threescore years old when she bare them .
and the lord said unto her , two nations are in thy womb , and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels ; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people ; and the elder shall serve the younger .
and when her days to be delivered were fulfilled , behold , there were twins in her womb .
and isaac intreated the lord for his wife , because she was barren : and the lord was intreated of him , and rebekah his wife conceived .
and the children struggled together within her ; and she said , if it be so , why am i thus ? and she went to inquire of the lord .
and god made the firmament , and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament : and it was so .
and god called the firmament heaven . and the evening and the morning were the second day .
and god said , let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place , and let the dry land appear : and it was so .
and jacob sod pottage : and esau came from the field , and he was faint :
and the earth was without form , and void ; and darkness was upon the face of the deep . and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters .
in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth .
and god saw the light , that it was good : and god divided the light from the darkness .
and god said , let there be light : and there was light .
and god said , let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters , and let it divide the waters from the waters .
and god called the light day , and the darkness he called night . and the evening and the morning were the first day .
and jacob said , sell me this day thy birthright .
and esau said to jacob , feed me , i pray thee , with that same red pottage ; for i am faint : therefore was his name called edom .
and he shall sit as a refiner and purifer of silver : and he shall purify the sons of levi , and purge them as gold and silver , that they may offer unto the lord an offering in righteousness .
then shall the offering of judah and jerusalem be pleasant unto the lord , as in the days of old , and as in former years .
behold , i will send my messenger , and he shall prepare the way before me : and the lord , whom ye seek , shall suddenly come to this temple , even the messenger of the covenant , whom ye delight in : behold , he shall come , saith the lord of hosts .
but who may abide the day of his coming ? and who shall stand when he appeareth ? for he is like a refiner ' s fire , and like fullers ' soap :
ye are cursed with a curse : for ye have robbed me , even this whole nation .
will a man rob god ? yet ye have robbed me . but ye say , wherein have we robbed thee ? in tithes and offerings .
for i am the lord , i change not ; therefore ye sons of jacob are not consumed .
and as they came down from the mountain , he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen , till the son of man were risen from the dead .
and there was a cloud that overshadowed them : and a voice came out of the cloud , saying , this is my beloved son : hear him .
and suddenly , when they had looked round about , they saw no man any more , save jesus only with themselves .
and peter answered and said to jesus , master , it is good for us to be here : and let us make three tabernacles ; one for thee , and one for moses , and one for elias .
for he wist not what to say ; for they were sore afraid .
and his raiment became shining , exceeding white as snow ; so as no fuller on earth can white them .
and there appeared unto them elias with moses : and they were talking with jesus .
and he said unto them , verily i say unto you , that there be some of them that stand here , which shall not taste of death , till they have seen the kingdom of god come with power .
and after six days jesus taketh with him peter , and james , and john , and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves : and he was transfigured before them .
and the patriarchs , moved with envy , sold joseph into egypt : but god was with him ,
and he gave him the covenant of circumcision : and so abraham begat isaac , and circumcised him the eighth day ; and isaac begat jacob ; and jacob begat the twelve patriarchs .
and the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will i judge , said god : and after that shall they come forth , and serve me in this place .
and god spake on this wise , that his seed should sojourn in a strange land ; and that they should bring them into bondage , and entreat them evil four hundred years .
and he gave him none inheritance in it , no , not so much as to set his foot on : yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession , and to his seed after him , when as yet he had no child .
then came he out of the land of the chaldaeans , and dwelt in charran : and from thence , when his father was dead , he removed him into this land , wherein ye now dwell .
and said unto him , get thee out of thy country , and from thy kindred , and come into the land which i shall shew thee .
and he said , men , brethren , and fathers , hearken ; the god of glory appeared unto our father abraham , when he was in mesopotamia , before he dwelt in charran ,
then said the high priest , are these things so ?
for the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous ; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity .
as the mountains are round about jerusalem , so the lord is round about his people from henceforth even for ever .
as for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways , the lord shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity : but peace shall be upon israel .
do good , o lord , unto those that be good , and to them that are upright in their hearts .
they that trust in the lord shall be as mount zion , which cannot be removed , but abideth for ever .
also unto shemaiah his son were sons born , that ruled throughout the house of their father : for they were mighty men of valour .
and meshelemiah had sons and brethren , strong men , eighteen .
all these of the sons of obed - edom : they and their sons and their brethren , able men for strength for the service , were threescore and two of obed - edom .
for the lord of hosts , that planted thee , hath pronounced evil against thee , for the evil of the house of israel and of the house of judah , which they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger in offering incense unto baal .
and the lord hath given me knowledge of it , and i know it : then thou shewedst me their doings .
for according to the number of thy cities were thy gods , o judah ; and according to the number of the streets of jerusalem have ye set up altars to that shameful thing , even altars to burn incense unto baal .
then shall the cities of judah and inhabitants of jerusalem go , and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense : but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble .
what hath my beloved to do in mine house , seeing she hath wrought lewdness with many , and the holy flesh is passed from thee ? when thou doest evil , then thou rejoicest .
concerning the divisions of the porters : of the korhites was meshelemiah the son of kore , of the sons of asaph .
therefore pray not thou for this people , neither lift up a cry or prayer for them : for i will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble .
elam the fifth , jehohanan the sixth , elioenai the seventh .
moreover the sons of obed - edom were , shemaiah the firstborn , jehozabad the second , joah the third , and sacar the fourth , and nethaneel the fifth ,
therefore thus saith the lord , behold , i will bring evil upon them , which they shall not be able to escape ; and though they shall cry unto me , i will not hearken unto them .
ammiel the sixth , issachar the seventh , peulthai the eighth : for god blessed him .
they are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers , which refused to hear my words ; and they went after other gods to serve them : the house of israel and the house of judah have broken my covenant which i made with their fathers .
and isaac was forty years old when he took rebekah to wife , the daughter of bethuel the syrian of padan - aram , the sister to laban the syrian .

now these are the generations of ishmael , abraham ' s son , whom hagar the egyptian , sarah ' s handmaid , bare unto abraham :
and it came to pass after the death of abraham , that god blessed his son isaac ; and isaac dwelt by the well lahai - roi .
the field which abraham purchased of the sons of heth : there was abraham buried , and sarah his wife .
and these are the years of the life of ishmael , an hundred and thirty and seven years : and he gave up the ghost and died ; and was gathered unto his people .
these are the sons of ishmael , and these are their names , by their towns , and by their castles ; twelve princes according to their nations .
hadar , and tema , jetur , naphish , and kedemah :
and mishma , and dumah , and massa ,
but the voice answered me again from heaven , what god hath cleansed , that call not thou common .
but i said , not so , lord : for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth .
and i heard a voice saying unto me , arise , peter ; slay and eat .
upon the which when i had fastened mine eyes , i considered , and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth , and wild beasts , and creeping things , and fowls of the air .
and the apostles and brethren that were in judaea heard that the gentiles had also received the word of god .
i was in the city of joppa praying : and in a trance i saw a vision , a certain vessel descend , as it had been a great sheet , let down from heaven by four corners ; and it came even to me :

wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master ' s servants that are come with thee : and as soon as ye be up early in the morning , and have light , depart .
they are wet with the showers of the mountains , and embrace the rock for want of a shelter .
they cause the naked to lodge without clothing , that they have no covering in the cold .
they pluck the fatherless from the breast , and take a pledge of the poor .
so david and his men rose up early to depart in the morning , to return into the land of the philistines . and the philistines went up to jezreel .
and when the angel which spake unto cornelius was departed , he called two of his household servants , and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually ;
and when he had declared all these things unto them , he sent them to joppa .
on the morrow , as they went on their journey , and drew nigh unto the city , peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour :
some remove the landmarks ; they violently take away flocks , and feed thereof .
why , seeing times are not hidden from the almighty , do they that know him not see his days ?
they turn the needy out of the way : the poor of the earth hide themselves together .
they drive away the ass of the fatherless , they take the widow ' s ox for a pledge .
they reap every one his corn in the field : and they gather the vintage of the wicked .
behold , as wild asses in the desert , go they forth to their work ; rising betimes for a prey : the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children .

to many thou shalt give the more inheritance , and to few thou shalt give the less inheritance : to every one shall his inheritance be given according to those that were numbered of him .
unto these the land shall be divided for an inheritance according to the number of names .
according to the lot shall the possession thereof be divided between many and few .
notwithstanding the land shall be divided by lot : according to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit .
and the fourth angel sounded , and the third part of the sun was smitten , and the third part of the moon , and the third part of the stars ; so as the third part of them was darkened , and the day shone not for a third part of it , and the night likewise .
and i beheld , and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven , saying with a loud voice , woe , woe , woe , to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels , which are yet to sound !
and the third angel sounded , and there fell a great star from heaven , burning as it were a lamp , and it fell upon the third part of the rivers , and upon the fountains of waters ;
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
and the name of the star is called wormwood : and the third part of the waters became wormwood ; and many men died of the waters , because they were made bitter .
these were the numbered of the children of israel , six hundred thousand and a thousand seven hundred and thirty .
and the time that jehu reigned over israel in samaria was twenty and eight years .
now the rest of the acts of jehu , and all that he did , and all his might , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel ?
and jehu slept with his fathers : and they buried him in samaria . and jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead .
in those days the lord began to cut israel short : and hazael smote them in all the coasts of israel ;
from jordan eastward , all the land of gilead , the gadites , and the reubenites , and the manassites , from aroer , which is by the river arnon , even gilead and bashan .
and the lord said unto jehu , because thou hast done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes , and hast done unto the house of ahab according to all that was in mine heart , thy children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of israel .
but jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the lord god of israel with all his heart : for he departed not from the sins of jeroboam , which made israel to sin .
of jezer , the family of the jezerites : of shillem , the family of the shillemites .
of the sons of naphtali after their families : of jahzeel , the family of the jahzeelites : of guni , the family of the gunites :

howbeit from the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat , who made israel to sin , jehu departed not from after them , to wit , the golden calves that were in bethel , and that were in dan .
and they brought forth the images out of the house of baal , and burned them .
and they brake down the image of baal , and brake down the house of baal , and made it a draught house unto this day .
thus jehu destroyed baal out of israel .
and jehu sent through all israel : and all the worshippers of baal came , so that there was not a man left that came not . and they came into the house of baal ; and the house of baal was full from one end to another .
and he said unto him that was over the vestry , bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of baal . and he brought them forth vestments .
and when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings , jehu appointed fourscore men without , and said , if any of the men whom i have brought into your hands escape , he that letteth him go , his life shall be for the life of him .
and jehu said , proclaim a solemn assembly for baal . and they proclaimed it .
nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold , whose height was threescore cubits , and the breadth thereof six cubits : he set it up in the plain of dura , in the province of babylon .
then the princes , the governors , and captains , the judges , the treasurers , the counsellers , the sheriffs , and all the rulers of the provinces , were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that nebuchadnezzar the king had set up ; and they stood before the image that nebuchadnezzar had set up .
then nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes , the governors , and the captains , the judges , the treasurers , the counsellers , the sheriffs , and all the rulers of the provinces , to come to the dedication of the image which nebuchadnezzar the king had set up .
then an herald cried aloud , to you it is commanded , o people , nations , and languages ,
the thought of foolishness is sin : and the scorner is an abomination to men .
that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet , flute , harp , sackbut , psaltery , dulcimer , and all kinds of musick , ye fall down and worship the golden image that nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up :
he that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person .
and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace .
wisdom is too high for a fool : he openeth not his mouth in the gate .
jehu met with the brethren of ahaziah king of judah , and said , who are ye ? and they answered , we are the brethren of ahaziah ; and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen .
and naaman said , shall there not then , i pray thee , be given to thy servant two mules ' burden of earth ? for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods , but unto the lord .
wherefore at that time certain chaldeans came near , and accused the jews .
and he arose and departed , and came to samaria . and as he was at the shearing house in the way ,
but he said , as the lord liveth , before whom i stand , i will receive none . and he urged him to take it ; but he refused .
they spake and said to the king nebuchadnezzar , o king , live for ever .
so jehu slew all that remained of the house of ahab in jezreel , and all his great men , and his kinsfolks , and his priests , until he left him none remaining .
and he said unto him , go in peace . so he departed from him a little way .
know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the lord , which the lord spake concerning the house of ahab : for the lord hath done that which he spake by his servant elijah .
in this thing the lord pardon thy servant , that when my master goeth into the house of rimmon to worship there , and he leaneth on my hand , and i bow myself in the house of rimmon : when i bow down myself in the house of rimmon , the lord pardon thy servant in this thing .
and when he came to samaria , he slew all that remained unto ahab in samaria , till he had destroyed him , according to the saying of the lord , which he spake to elijah .
and his servants came near , and spake unto him , and said , my father , if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing , wouldest thou not have done it ? how much rather then , when he saith to thee , wash , and be clean ?
for their heart studieth destruction , and their lips talk of mischief .
and he said , come with me , and see my zeal for the lord . so they made him ride in his chariot .
are not abana and pharpar , rivers of damascus , better than all the waters of israel ? may i not wash in them , and be clean ? so he turned and went away in a rage .
be not thou envious against evil men , neither desire to be with them .
and he returned to the man of god , he and all his company , and came , and stood before him : and he said , behold , now i know that there is no god in all earth , but in israel : now therefore , i pray thee , take a blessing of thy servant .
and he said , take them alive . and they took them alive , and slew them at the pit of the shearing house , even two and forty men ; neither left he any of them .
then went he down , and dipped himself seven times in jordan , according to the saying of the man of god : and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child , and he was clean .
for by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war : and in multitude of counsellers there is safety .
a wise man is strong ; yea , a man of knowledge increaseth strength .
but naaman was wroth , and went away , and said , behold , i thought , he will surely come out to me , and stand , and call on the name of the lord his god , and strike his hand over the place , and recover the leper .
and eleazar the son of aaron died ; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to phinehas his son , which was given him in mount ephraim .
and by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches .
and jehu gathered all the people together , and said unto them , ahab served baal a little ; but jehu shall serve him much .
and elisha sent a messenger unto him , saying , go and wash in the jordan seven times , and thy flesh shall come again to thee , and thou shalt be clean .
through wisdom is an house builded ; and by understanding it is established :
and those that were numbered of them were twenty and three thousand , all males from a month old and upward : for they were not numbered among the children of israel , because there was no inheritance given them among the children of israel .
these are they that were numbered by moses and eleazar the priest , who numbered the children of israel in the plains of moab by jordan near jericho .
and unto aaron was born nadab , and abihu , eleazar , and ithamar .
and nadab and abihu died , when they offered strange fire before the lord .
for the lord had said of them , they shall surely die in the wilderness . and there was not left a man of them , save caleb the son of jephunneh , and joshua the son of nun .
and the people said unto joshua , nay ; but we will serve the lord .
if ye forsake the lord , and serve strange gods , then he will turn and do you hurt , and consume you , after that he hath done you good .
and joshua said unto the people , ye cannot serve the lord : for he is an holy god ; he is a jealous god ; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins .
and i have given you a land for which ye did not labour , and cities which ye built not , and ye dwell in them ; of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat .
now therefore fear the lord , and serve him in sincerity and in truth : and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood , and in egypt ; and serve ye the lord .
and ye went over jordan , and came unto jericho : and the men of jericho fought against you , the amorites , and the perizzites , and the canaanites , and the hittites , and the girgashites , the hivites , and the jebusites ; and i delivered them into your hand .
and i sent the hornet before you , which drave them out from before you , even the two kings of the amorites ; but not with thy sword , nor with thy bow .
for the lord our god , he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of egypt , from the house of bondage , and which did those great signs in our sight , and preserved us in all the way wherein we went , and among all the people through whom we passed :
and the lord drave out from before us all the people , even the amorites which dwelt in the land : therefore will we also serve the lord ; for he is our god .
and the people answered and said , god forbid that we should forsake the lord , to serve other gods ;
and they buried him in the border of his inheritance in timnath - serah , which is in mount ephraim , on the north side of the hill of gaash .
and the bones of joseph , which the children of israel brought up out of egypt , buried they in shechem , in a parcel of ground which jacob bought of the sons of hamor the father of shechem for an hundred pieces of silver : and it became the inheritance of the children of joseph .
and israel served the lord all the days of joshua , and all the days of the elders that overlived joshua , and which had known all the works of the lord , that he had done for israel .
the leprosy therefore of naaman shall cleave unto thee , and unto thy seed for ever . and he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow .
and he said , all is well . my master hath sent me , saying , behold , even now there be come to me from mount ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets : give them , i pray thee , a talent of silver , and two changes of garments .
and joshua said unto the people , ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the lord , to serve him . and they said , we are witnesses .
so gehazi followed after naaman . and when naaman saw him running after him , he lighted down from the chariot to meet him , and said , is all well ?
now therefore put away , said he , the strange gods which are among you , and incline your heart unto the lord god of israel .
but gehazi , the servant of elisha the man of god , said , behold , my master hath spared naaman this syrian , in not receiving at his hands that which he brought : but , as the lord liveth , i will run after him , and take somewhat of him .
and the people said unto joshua , the lord our god will we serve , and his voice will we obey .
so joshua made a covenant with the people that day , and set them a statute and an ordinance in shechem .
and he said unto him , went not mine heart with thee , when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee ? is it a time to receive money , and to receive garments , and oliveyards , and vineyards , and sheep , and oxen , and menservants , and maidservants ?
and joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of god , and took a great stone , and set it up there under an oak , that was by the sanctuary of the lord .
but he went in , and stood before his master . and elisha said unto him , whence comest thou , gehazi ? and he said , thy servant went no whither .
and joshua said unto all the people , behold , this stone shall be a witness unto us ; for it hath heard all the words of the lord which he spake unto us : it shall be therefore a witness unto you , lest ye deny your god .
and when he came to the tower , he took them from their hand , and bestowed them in the house : and he let the men go , and they departed .
so joshua let the people depart , every man unto his inheritance .
and naaman said , be content , take two talents . and he urged him , and bound two talents of silver in two bags , with two changes of garments , and laid them upon two of his servants ; and they bare them before him .
and it came to pass after these things , that joshua the son of nun , the servant of the lord , died , being an hundred and ten years old .
then said i , o my lord , what are these ? and the angel that talked with me said unto me , i will shew thee what these be .
upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month , which is the month sebat , in the second year of darius , came the word of the lord unto zechariah , the son of berechiah , the son of iddo the prophet , saying ,
in mine ears said the lord of hosts , of a truth many houses shall be desolate , even great and fair , without inhabitant .
i saw by night , and behold a man riding upon a red horse , and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom ; and behind him were there red horses , speckled , and white .
and i will lay it waste : it shall not be pruned , nor digged ; but there shall come up briers and thorns : i will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it .
for the vineyard of the lord of hosts is the house of israel , and the men of judah his pleasant plant : and he looked for judgment , but behold oppression ; for righteousness , but behold a cry .
what could have been done more to my vineyard , that i have not done in it ? wherefore , when i looked that it should bring forth grapes , brought it forth wild grapes ?
and now go to ; i will tell you what i will do to my vineyard : i will take away the hedge thereof , and it shall be eaten up ; and break down the wall thereof , and it shall be trodden down :
and he fenced it , and gathered out the stones thereof , and planted it with the choicest vine , and built a tower in the midst of it , and also made a winepress therein : and he looked that it should bring forth grapes , and it brought forth wild grapes .
in the eighth month , in the second year of darius , came the word of the lord unto zechariah , the son of berechiah , the son of iddo the prophet , saying ,
and now , o inhabitants of jerusalem , and men of judah , judge , i pray you , betwixt me and my vineyard .
the lord hath been sore displeased with your fathers .
now will i sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard . my wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill :
your fathers , where are they ? and the prophets , do they live for ever ?
but my words and my statutes , which i commanded my servants the prophets , did they not take hold of your fathers ? and they returned and said , like as the lord of hosts thought to do unto us , according to our ways , and according to our doings , so hath he dealt with us .
therefore say thou unto them , thus saith the lord of hosts ; turn ye unto me , saith the lord of hosts , and i will turn unto you , saith the lord of hosts .
be ye not as your fathers , unto whom the former prophets have cried , saying , thus saith the lord of hosts ; turn ye now from your evil ways , and from your evil doings : but they did not hear , nor hearken unto me , saith the lord .
and pharaoh commanded his men concerning him : and they sent him away , and his wife , and all that he had .
praise ye the lord : for it is good to sing praises unto our god ; for it is pleasant ; and praise is comely .
he healeth the broken in heart , and bindeth up their wounds .
the lord doth build up jerusalem : he gathereth together the outcasts of israel .
great is our lord , and of great power : his understanding is infinite .
he telleth the number of the stars ; he calleth them all by their names .
who covereth the heaven with clouds , who prepareth rain for the earth , who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains .
he giveth to the beast his food , and to the young ravens which cry .
the lord lifteth up the meek : he casteth the wicked down to the ground .
sing unto the lord with thanksgiving ; sing praise upon the harp unto our god :
and so terrible was the sight , that moses said , i exceedingly fear and quake : )
( for they could not endure that which was commanded , and if so much as a beast touch the mountain , it shall be stoned , or thrust through with a dart :
see that ye refuse not him that speaketh . for if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth , much more shall not we escape , if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven :
and there was an enlarging , and a winding about still upward to the side chambers : for the winding about of the house went still upward round about the house : therefore the breadth of the house was still upward , and so increased from the lowest chamber to the highest by the midst .
and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant , and to the blood of sprinkling , that speaketh better things than that of abel .
i saw also the height of the house round about : the foundations of the side chambers were a full reed of six great cubits .
to the general assembly and church of the firstborn , which are written in heaven , and to god the judge of all , and to the spirits of just men made perfect ,
the thickness of the wall , which was for the side chamber without , was five cubits : and that which was left was the place of the side chambers that were within .
but ye are come unto mount sion , and unto the city of the living god , the heavenly jerusalem , and to an innumerable company of angels ,
seemeth it but a small thing unto you , that the god of israel hath separated you from the congregation of israel , to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the lord , and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them ?
for our god is a consuming fire .
and moses said unto korah , hear , i pray you , ye sons of levi :
wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved , let us have grace , whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear :
and put fire therein , and put incense in them before the lord to morrow : and it shall be that the man whom the lord doth choose , he shall be holy : ye take too much upon you , ye sons of levi .
and this word , yet once more , signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken , as of things that are made , that those things which cannot be shaken may remain .
this do ; take you censers , korah , and all his company ;
and he spake unto korah and unto all his company , saying , even to morrow the lord will shew who are his , and who is holy ; and will cause him to come near unto him : even him whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near unto him .
why saidst thou , she is my sister ? so i might have taken her to me to wife : now therefore behold thy wife , take her , and go thy way .
and esau said , let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me . and he said , what needeth it ? let me find grace in the sight of my lord .
and pharaoh called abram , and said , what is this that thou hast done unto me ? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife ?
so esau returned that day on his way unto seir .
and the sound of a trumpet , and the voice of words ; which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more :
and the breadth of the door was ten cubits ; and the sides of the door were five cubits on the one side , and five cubits on the other side : and he measured the length thereof , forty cubits : and the breadth , twenty cubits .
and he entreated abram well for her sake : and he had sheep , and oxen , and he asses , and menservants , and maidservants , and she asses , and camels .
and jacob came to shalem , a city of shechem , which is in the land of canaan , when he came from padan - aram ; and pitched his tent before the city .
afterward he brought me to the temple , and measured the posts , six cubits broad on the one side , and six cubits broad on the other side , which was the breadth of the tabernacle .
and he bought a parcel of a field , where he had spread his tent , at the hand of the children of hamor , shechem ' s father , for an hundred pieces of money .
so he measured the length thereof , twenty cubits ; and the breadth , twenty cubits , before the temple : and he said unto me , this is the most holy place .
then went he inward , and measured the post of the door , two cubits ; and the door , six cubits ; and the breadth of the door , seven cubits .
and the side chambers were three , one over another , and thirty in order ; and they entered into the wall which was of the house for the side chambers round about , that they might have hold , but they had not hold in the wall of the house .
after he measured the wall of the house , six cubits ; and the breadth of every side chamber , four cubits , round about the house on every side .
and it came to pass , when he was come near to enter into egypt , that he said unto sarai his wife , behold now , i know that thou art a fair woman to look upon :
and there was a famine in the land : and abram went down into egypt to sojourn there ; for the famine was grievous in the land .
and jacob said , nay , i pray thee , if now i have found grace in thy sight , then receive my present at my hand : for therefore i have seen thy face , as though i had seen the face of god , and thou wast pleased with me .
the princes also of pharaoh saw her , and commended her before pharaoh : and the woman was taken into pharaoh ' s house .
take , i pray thee , my blessing that is brought to thee ; because god hath dealt graciously with me , and because i have enough . and he urged him , and he took it .
and it came to pass , that , when abram was come into egypt , the egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair .
and he said , let us take our journey , and let us go , and i will go before thee .
say , i pray thee , thou art my sister : that it may be well with me for thy sake ; and my soul shall live because of thee .
and he said unto him , my lord knoweth that the children are tender , and the flocks and herds with young are with me : and if men should overdrive them one day , all the flock will die .
therefore it shall come to pass , when the egyptians shall see thee , that they shall say , this is his wife : and they will kill me , but they will save thee alive .
let my lord , i pray thee , pass over before his servant : and i will lead on softly , according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure , until i come unto my lord unto seir .
for they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure ; but he for our profit , that we might be partakers of his holiness .
lest there be any fornicator , or profane person , as esau , who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright .
looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of god ; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you , and thereby many be defiled ;
for ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched , and that burned with fire , nor unto blackness , and darkness , and tempest ,
for ye know how that afterward , when he would have inherited the blessing , he was rejected : for he found no place of repentance , though he sought it carefully with tears .
follow peace with all men , and holiness , without which no man shall see the lord :
and make straight paths for your feet , lest that which is lame be turned out of the way ; but let it rather be healed .
notwithstanding the children of korah died not .
the sons of simeon after their families : of nemuel , the family of the nemuelites : of jamin , the family of the jaminites : of jachin , the family of the jachinites :
and the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed them up together with korah , when that company died , what time the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men : and they became a sign .
and they rose up before moses , with certain of the children of israel , two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly , famous in the congregation , men of renown :
and they gathered themselves together against moses and against aaron , and said unto them , ye take too much upon you , seeing all the congregation are holy , every one of them , and the lord is among them : wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the lord ?
and when moses heard it , he fell upon his face :
the sons of judah were er and onan : and er and onan died in the land of canaan .
of arod , the family of the arodites : of areli , the family of the arelites .
these are the families of the children of gad according to those that were numbered of them , forty thousand and five hundred .
and he erected there an altar , and called it el - elohe - israel .
the children of gad after their families : of zephon , the family of the zephonites : of haggi , the family of the haggites : of shuni , the family of the shunites :
of ozni , the family of the oznites : of eri , the family of the erites :
of zerah , the family of the zarhites : of shaul , the family of the shaulites .
these are the families of the simeonites , twenty and two thousand and two hundred .
for for this cause pay ye tribute also : for they are god ' s ministers , attending continually upon this very thing .
render therefore to all their dues : tribute to whom tribute is due ; custom to whom custom ; fear to whom fear ; honour to whom honour .
owe no man any thing , but to love one another : for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law .
for this , thou shalt not commit adultery , thou shalt not kill , thou shalt not steal , thou shalt not bear false witness , thou shalt not covet ; and if there be any other commandment , it is briefly comprehended in this saying , namely , thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself .
whosoever therefore resisteth the power , resisteth the ordinance of god : and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation .
for rulers are not a terror to good works , but to the evil . wilt thou then not be afraid of the power ? do that which is good , and thou shalt have praise of the same :
for he is the minister of god to thee for good . but if thou do that which is evil , be afraid ; for he beareth not the sword in vain : for he is the minister of god , a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil .
wherefore ye must needs be subject , not only for wrath , but also for conscience sake .
let every soul be subject unto the higher powers . for there is no power but of god : the powers that be are ordained of god .
i will sing a new song unto thee , o god : upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings will i sing praises unto thee .
man is like to vanity : his days are as a shadow that passeth away .
lord , what is man , that thou takest knowledge of him ! or the son of man , that thou makest account of him !
my goodness , and my fortress ; my high tower , and my deliverer ; my shield , and he in whom i trust ; who subdueth my people under me .
blessed be the lord my strength , which teacheth my hands to war , and my fingers to fight :
whose mouth speaketh vanity , and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood .
send thine hand from above ; rid me , and deliver me out of great waters , from the hand of strange children ;
cast forth lightning , and scatter them : shoot out thine arrows , and destroy them .
bow thy heavens , o lord , and come down : touch the mountains , and they shall smoke .
for to this end also did i write , that i might know the proof of you , whether ye be obedient in all things .
wherefore i beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him .
but i determined this with myself , that i would not come again to you in heaviness .
for if i make you sorry , who is he then that maketh me glad , but the same which is made sorry by me ?
and i wrote this same unto you , lest , when i came , i should have sorrow from them of whom i ought to rejoice ; having confidence in you all , that my joy is the joy of you all .
for out of much affliction and anguish of heart i wrote unto you with many tears ; not that ye should be grieved , but that ye might know the love which i have more abundantly unto you .
but if any have caused grief , he hath not grieved me , but in part : that i may not overcharge you all .
so that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him , and comfort him , lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow .
all the horns of the wicked also will i cut off ; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted .
and it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year , in the first month , in the first day of the month , the word of the lord came unto me , saying ,
and it shall be no more the confidence of the house of israel , which bringeth their iniquity to remembrance , when they shall look after them : but they shall know that i am the lord god .
it shall be the basest of the kingdoms ; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations : for i will diminish them , that they shall no more rule over the nations .
and i will bring again the captivity of egypt , and will cause them to return into the land of pathros , into the land of their habitation ; and they shall be there a base kingdom .
and it shall be our righteousness , if we observe to do all these commandments before the lord our god , as he hath commanded us .
therefore thus saith the lord god ; behold , i will give the land of egypt unto nebuchadrezzar king of babylon ; and he shall take her multitude , and take her spoil , and take her prey ; and it shall be the wages for his army .
and the lord commanded us to do all these statutes , to fear the lord our god , for our good always , that he might preserve us alive , as it is at this day .
son of man , nebuchadrezzar king of babylon caused his army to serve a great service against tyrus : every head was made bald , and every shoulder was peeled : yet had he no wages , nor his army , for tyrus , for the service that he had served against it :
and these were they which went up also from telmelah , telharesha , cherub , addon , and immer : but they could not shew their father ' s house , nor their seed , whether they were of israel .
all the nethinims , and the children of solomon ' s servants , were three hundred ninety and two .
and of the priests : the children of habaiah , the children of koz , the children of barzillai , which took one of the daughters of barzillai the gileadite to wife , and was called after their name .
the children of delaiah , the children of tobiah , the children of nekoda , six hundred forty and two .
and the tirshatha said unto them , that they should not eat of the most holy things , till there stood up a priest with urim and thummim .
they answered and said unto him , art thou also of galilee ? search , and look : for out of galilee ariseth no prophet .
the children of barkos , the children of sisera , the children of tamah ,
doth our law judge any man , before it hear him , and know what he doeth ?
nicodemus saith unto them , ( he that came to jesus by night , being one of them , )
the children of solomon ' s servants : the children of sotai , the children of sophereth , the children of perida ,
the children of jaala , the children of darkon , the children of giddel ,
the children of shephatiah , the children of hattil , the children of pochereth of zebaim , the children of amon .
and every man went unto his own house .
i have given him the land of egypt for his labour wherewith he served against it , because they wrought for me , saith the lord god .
in that day will i cause the horn of the house of israel to bud forth , and i will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them ; and they shall know that i am the lord .
the officers answered , never man spake like this man .
the children of reaiah , the children of rezin , the children of nekoda ,
then answered them the pharisees , are ye also deceived ?
have any of the rulers or of the pharisees believed on him ?
but this people who knoweth not the law are cursed .
the children of bazlith , the children of mehida , the children of harsha ,
the children of bakbuk , the children of hakupha , the children of harhur ,
the children of besai , the children of meunim , the children of nephishesim ,
the children of gazzam , the children of uzza , the children of phaseah ,
the nethinims : the children of ziha , the children of hashupha , the children of tabbaoth ,
the children of keros , the children of sia , the children of padon ,
others said , this is the christ . but some said , shall christ come out of galilee ?
the singers : the children of asaph , an hundred forty and eight .
many of the people therefore , when they heard this saying , said , of a truth this is the prophet .
the porters : the children of shallum , the children of ater , the children of talmon , the children of akkub , the children of hatita , the children of shobai , an hundred thirty and eight .
so there was a division among the people because of him .
hath not the scripture said , that christ cometh of the seed of david , and out of the town of bethlehem , where david was ?
the children of lebana , the children of hagaba , the children of shalmai ,
and some of them would have taken him ; but no man laid hands on him .
the children of hanan , the children of giddel , the children of gahar ,
behold , therefore i am against thee , and against thy rivers , and i will make the land of egypt utterly waste and desolate , from the tower of syene even unto the border of ethiopia .
no foot of man shall pass through it , nor foot of beast shall pass through it , neither shall it be inhabited forty years .
and i will make the land of egypt desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate , and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be desolate forty years : and i will scatter the egyptians among the nations , and will disperse them through the countries .
yet thus saith the lord god ; at the end of forty years will i gather the egyptians from the people whither they were scattered :
because of the house of the lord our god i will seek thy good .
howbeit many of them which heard the word believed ; and the number of the men was about five thousand .
and it came to pass on the morrow , that their rulers , and elders , and scribes ,
being grieved that they taught the people , and preached through jesus the resurrection from the dead .
and they laid hands on them , and put them in hold unto the next day : for it was now eventide .
then peter , filled with the holy ghost , said unto them , ye rulers of the people , and elders of israel ,
if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man , by what means he is made whole ;
and annas the high priest , and caiaphas , and john , and alexander , and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest , were gathered together at jerusalem .
and when they had set them in the midst , they asked , by what power , or by what name , have ye done this ?
and as they spake unto the people , the priests , and the captain of the temple , and the sadducees , came upon them ,
and houses full of all good things , which thou filledst not , and wells digged , which thou diggedst not , vineyards and olive trees , which thou plantedst not ; when thou shalt have eaten and be full ;
then beware lest thou forget the lord , which brought thee forth out of the land of egypt , from the house of bondage .
and it shall be , when the lord thy god shall have brought thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers , to abraham , to isaac , and to jacob , to give thee great and goodly cities , which thou buildedst not ,
ye shall not go after other gods , of the gods of the people which are round about you ;
thou shalt fear the lord thy god , and serve him , and shalt swear by his name .
ye shall not tempt the lord your god , as ye tempted him in massah .
( for the lord thy god is a jealous god among you ) lest the anger of the lord thy god be kindled against thee , and destroy thee from off the face of the earth .
and thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the lord : that it may be well with thee , and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the lord sware unto thy fathers ,
ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the lord your god , and his testimonies , and his statutes , which he hath commanded thee .
to cast out all thine enemies from before thee , as the lord hath spoken .
so the priests , and the levites , and the porters , and the singers , and some of the people , and the nethinims , and all israel , dwelt in their cities ; and when the seventh month came , the children of israel were in their cities .
and that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand drams of gold , and two thousand pound of silver , and threescore and seven priests ' garments .
and some of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of the work twenty thousand drams of gold , and two thousand and two hundred pound of silver .
and some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work . the tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold , fifty basons , five hundred and thirty priests ' garments .
their horses , seven hundred thirty and six : their mules , two hundred forty and five :
their camels , four hundred thirty and five : six thousand seven hundred and twenty asses .
the whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore ,
beside their manservants and their maidservants , of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven : and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women .
our feet shall stand within thy gates , o jerusalem .
jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together :
whither the tribes go up , the tribes of the lord , unto the testimony of israel , to give thanks unto the name of the lord .
and when thy son asketh thee in time to come , saying , what mean the testimonies , and the statutes , and the judgments , which the lord our god hath commanded you ?
for there are set thrones of judgment , the thrones of the house of david .
then thou shalt say unto thy son , we were pharaoh ' s bondmen in egypt ; and the lord brought us out of egypt with a mighty hand :
pray for the peace of jerusalem : they shall prosper that love thee .
and the lord shewed signs and wonders , great and sore , upon egypt , upon pharaoh , and upon all his household , before our eyes :
peace be within thy walls , and prosperity within thy palaces .
and he brought us out from thence , that he might bring us in , to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers .
for my brethren and companions ' sakes , i will now say , peace be within thee .
and he made a vail of blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen : with cherubims made he it of cunning work .
and he overlaid the boards with gold , and made their rings of gold to be places for the bars , and overlaid the bars with gold .
and he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one end to the other .
and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle , and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward .
and he made bars of shittim wood ; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle ,
and there were eight boards ; and their sockets were sixteen sockets of silver , under every board two sockets .
and the king said , is the young man absalom safe ? and ahimaaz answered , when joab sent the king ' s servant , and me thy servant , i saw a great tumult , but i knew not what it was .
and ahimaaz called , and said unto the king , all is well . and he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king , and said , blessed be the lord thy god , which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king .
but when his brethren were gone up , then went he also up unto the feast , not openly , but as it were in secret .
and the watchman said , me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of ahimaaz the son of zadok . and the king said , he is a good man , and cometh with good tidings .
then the jews sought him at the feast , and said , where is he ?
and the watchman saw another man running : and the watchman called unto the porter , and said , behold another man running alone . and the king said , he also bringeth tidings .
and there was much murmuring among the people concerning him : for some said , he is a good man : others said , nay ; but he deceiveth the people .
and the watchman cried , and told the king . and the king said , if he be alone , there is tidings in his mouth . and he came apace , and drew near .
now about the midst of the feast jesus went up into the temple , and taught .
but howsoever , said he , let me run . and he said unto him , run . then ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain , and overran cushi .
howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the jews .
and david sat between the two gates : and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall , and lifted up his eyes , and looked , and behold a man running alone .
jesus answered them , and said , my doctrine is not mine , but his that sent me .
then said joab to cushi , go tell the king what thou hast seen . and cushi bowed himself unto joab , and ran .
who is this king of glory ? the lord strong and mighty , the lord mighty in battle .
and the jews marvelled , saying , how knoweth this man letters , having never learned ?
then said ahimaaz the son of zadok yet again to joab , but howsoever , let me , i pray thee , also run after cushi . and joab said , wherefore wilt thou run , my son , seeing that thou hast no tidings ready ?
lift up your heads , o ye gates ; even lift them up , ye everlasting doors ; and the king of glory shall come in .
he that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory : but he that seeketh his glory that sent him , the same is true , and no unrighteousness is in him .
if any man will do his will , he shall know of the doctrine , whether it be of god , or whether i speak of myself .
and joab said unto him , thou shalt not bear tidings this day , but thou shalt bear tidings another day : but this day thou shalt bear no tidings , because the king ' s son is dead .
did not moses give you the law , and yet none of you keepeth the law ? why go ye about to kill me ?
for he hath founded it upon the seas , and established it upon the floods .
who shall ascend into the hill of the lord ? or who shall stand in his holy place ?
the earth is the lord ' s , and the fulness thereof ; the world , and they that dwell therein .
and the five pillars of it with their hooks : and he overlaid their chapiters and their fillets with gold : but their five sockets were of brass .
this is the generation of them that seek him , that seek thy face , o jacob . selah .
lift up your head , o ye gates ; and be ye lift up , ye everlasting doors ; and the king of glory shall come in .
and he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood , and overlaid them with gold : their hooks were of gold ; and he cast for them four sockets of silver .
he that hath clean hands , and a pure heart ; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity , nor sworn deceitfully .
and he made an hanging for the tabernacle door of blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen , of needlework ;
he shall receive the blessing from the lord , and righteousness from the god of his salvation .
then said ahimaaz the son of zadok , let me now run , and bear the king tidings , how that the lord hath avenged him of his enemies .
and ten young men that bare joab ' s armour compassed about and smote absalom , and slew him .
then said joab , i may not tarry thus with thee . and he took three darts in his hand , and thrust them through the heart of absalom , while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak .
and they took absalom , and cast him into a great pit in the wood , and laid a very great heap of stones upon him : and all israel fled every one to his tent .
and joab blew the trumpet , and the people returned from pursuing after israel : for joab held back the people .
and joab said unto the man that told him , and , behold , thou sawest him , and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground ? and i would have given thee ten shekels of silver , and a girdle .
and the man said unto joab , though i should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine hand , yet would i not put forth mine hand against the king ' s son : for in our hearing the king charged thee and abishai and ittai , saying , beware that none touch the young man absalom .
otherwise i should have wrought falsehood against mine own life : for there is no matter hid from the king , and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me .
and he made fifty taches of gold , and coupled the curtains one unto another with the taches : so it became one tabernacle .
fifty loops made he in one curtain , and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second : the loops held one curtain to another .
and he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling : likewise he made in the uttermost side of another curtain , in the coupling of the second .
and he coupled the five curtains one unto another : and the other five curtains he coupled one unto another .
and many of the people believed on him , and said , when christ cometh , will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done ?
the pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him ; and the pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him .
then said jesus unto them , yet a little while am i with you , and then i go unto him that sent me .
ye shall seek me , and shall not find me : and where i am , thither ye cannot come .
then they sought to take him : but no man laid hands on him , because his hour was not yet come .
( but this spake he of the spirit , which they that believe on him should receive : for the holy ghost was not yet given ; because that jesus was not yet glorified . )
what manner of saying is this that he said , ye shall seek me , and shall not find me : and where i am , thither ye cannot come ?
then said the jews among themselves , whither will he go , that we shall not find him ? will he go unto the dispersed among the gentiles , and teach the gentiles ?
he that believeth on me , as the scripture hath said , out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water .
in the last day , that great day of the feast , jesus stood and cried , saying , if any man thirst , let him come unto me , and drink .
and he coupled five curtains by themselves , and six curtains by themselves .
and he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain in the coupling , and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second .
and he made curtains of goats ' hair for the tent over the tabernacle : eleven curtains he made them .
the length of one curtain was thirty cubits , and four cubits was the breadth of one curtain : the eleven curtains were of one size .
and he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together , that it might be one .
and he made a covering for the tent of rams ' skins dyed red , and a covering of badgers ' skins above that .
and because he saw it pleased the jews , he proceeded further to take peter also . ( then were the days of unleavened bread . )
and when he had apprehended him , he put him in prison , and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him ; intending after easter to bring him forth to the people .
now about that time herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church .
and he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood , standing up .
and he killed james the brother of john with the sword .
one board had two tenons , equally distant one from another : thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle .
the length of a board was ten cubits , and the breadth of a board one cubit and a half .
and forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards ; two sockets under one board for his two tenons , and two sockets under another board for his two tenons .
and he made boards for the tabernacle ; twenty boards for the south side southward :
moses therefore gave unto you circumcision ; ( not because it is of moses , but of the fathers ; ) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man .
if a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision , that the law of moses should not be broken ; are ye angry at me , because i have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day ?
the people answered and said , thou hast a devil : who goeth about to kill thee ?
jesus answered and said unto them , i have done one work , and ye all marvel .
but i know him : for i am from him , and he hath sent me .
howbeit we know this man whence he is : but when christ cometh , no man knoweth whence he is .
but , lo , he speaketh boldly , and they say nothing unto him . do the rulers know indeed that this is the very christ ?
then said some of them of jerusalem , is not this he , whom they seek to kill ?
judge not according to the appearance , but judge righteous judgment .
and for the other side of the tabernacle , which is toward the north corner , he made twenty boards ,
and their forty sockets of silver ; two sockets under one board , and two sockets under another board .
and for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards .
and he went out , and followed him ; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel ; but thought he saw a vision .
and two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides .
and they were coupled beneath , and coupled together at the head thereof , to one ring : thus he did to both of them in both the corners .
and , behold , the angel of the lord came upon him , and a light shined in the prison : and he smote peter on the side , and raised him up , saying , arise up quickly . and his chains fell off from his hands .
and when herod would have brought him forth , the same night peter was sleeping between two soldiers , bound with two chains : and the keepers before the door kept the prison .
of jeduthun : the sons of jeduthun ; gedaliah , and zeri , and jeshaiah , hashabiah , and mattithiah , six , under the hands of their father jeduthun , who prophesied with a harp , to give thanks and to praise the lord .
or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past , and his owner hath not kept him in ; he shall surely pay ox for ox ; and the dead shall be his own .
of heman : the sons of heman ; bukkiah , mattaniah , uzziel , shebuel , and jerimoth , hananiah , hanani , eliathah , giddalti , and romamti - ezer , joshbekashah , mallothi , hothir , and mahazioth :
all these were the sons of heman the king ' s seer in the words of god , to lift up the horn . and god gave to heman fourteen sons and three daughters .
all these were under the hands of their father for song in the house of the lord , with cymbals , psalteries , and harps , for the service of the house of god , according to the king ' s order to asaph , jeduthun , and heman .
if the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant ; he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver , and the ox shall be stoned .
and if a man shall open a pit , or if a man shall dig a pit , and not cover it , and an ox or an ass fall therein ;
now are we sure that thou knowest all things , and needest not that any man should ask thee : by this we believe that thou camest forth from god .
moreover david and the captains of the host separated to the service of the sons of asaph , and of heman , and of jeduthun , who should prophesy with harps , with psalteries , and with cymbals : and the number of the workmen according to their service was :
the owner of the pit shall make it good , and give money unto the owner of them ; and the dead beast shall be his .
of the sons of asaph ; zaccur , and joseph , and nethaniah , and asarelah , the sons of asaph under the hands of asaph , which prophesied according to the order of the king .
and if one man ' s ox hurt another ' s , that he die ; then they shall sell the live ox , and divide the money of it ; and the dead ox also they shall divide .
jesus answered them , do ye now believe ?
these things i have spoken unto you , that in me ye might have peace . in the world ye shall have tribulation : but be of good cheer ; i have overcome the world .
whether he have gored a son , or have gored a daughter , according to this judgment shall it be done unto him .
if there be laid on him a sum of money , then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him .
and they cast lots , ward against ward , as well the small as the great , the teacher as the scholar .
so the number of them , with their brethren that were instructed in the songs of the lord , even all that were cunning , was two hundred fourscore and eight .
now the first lot came forth for asaph to joseph : the second to gedaliah , who with his brethren and sons were twelve :
but if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past , and it hath been testified to his owner , and he hath not kept him in , but that he hath killed a man or a woman ; the ox shall be stoned , and his owner also shall be put to death .
and if he smite out his manservant ' s tooth , or his maidservant ' s tooth ; he shall let him go free for his tooth ' s sake .
if an ox gore a man or a woman , that they die : then the ox shall be surely stoned , and his flesh shall not be eaten ; but the owner of the ox shall be quit .
burning for burning , wound for wound , stripe for stripe .
and if a man smite the eye of his servant , or the eye of his maid , that it perish ; he shall let him go free for his eye ' s sake .
and if any mischief follow , then thou shalt give life for life ,
eye for eye , tooth for tooth , hand for hand , foot for foot ,
notwithstanding , if he continue a day or two , he shall not be punished : for he is his money .
if men strive , and hurt a woman with child , so that her fruit depart from her , and yet no mischief follow : he shall be surely punished , according as the woman ' s husband will lay upon him ; and he shall pay as the judges determine .
and ye now therefore have sorrow : but i will see you again , and your heart shall rejoice , and your joy no man taketh from you .
and if a man smite his servant , or his maid , with a rod , and he die under his hand ; he shall be surely punished .
and in that day ye shall ask me nothing . verily , verily , i say unto you , whatsoever ye shall ask the father in my name , he will give it you .
verily , verily , i say unto you , that ye shall weep and lament , but the world shall rejoice : and ye shall be sorrowful , but your sorrow shall be turned into joy .
a woman when she is in travail hath sorrow , because her hour is come : but as soon as she is delivered of the child , she remembereth no more the anguish , for joy that a man is born into the world .
at that day ye shall ask in my name : and i say not unto you , that i will pray the father for you :
for the father himself loveth you , because ye have loved me , and have believed that i came out from god .
hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name : ask , and ye shall receive , that your joy may be full .
these things have i spoken unto you in proverbs : but the time cometh , when i shall no more speak unto you in proverbs , but i shall shew you plainly of the father .
he that believeth on the son of god hath the witness in himself : he that believeth not god hath made him a liar ; because he believeth not the record that god gave of his son .
and this is the record , that god hath given to us eternal life , and this life is in his son .
he that hath the son hath life ; and he that hath not the son of god hath not life .
i came forth from the father , and am come into the world : again , i leave the world , and go to the father .
these things have i written unto you that believe on the name of the son of god ; that ye may know that ye have eternal life , and that ye may believe on the name of the son of god .
his disciples said unto him , lo , now speakest thou plainly , and speakest no proverb .
all unrighteousness is sin : and there is a sin not unto death .
and if men strive together , and one smite another with a stone , or with his fist , and he die not , but keepeth his bed :
this is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen , either in the warp , or woof , or any thing of skins , to pronounce it clean , or to pronounce it unclean .
if any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death , he shall ask , and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death . there is a sin unto death : i do not say that he shall pray for it .
if he rise again , and walk abroad upon his staff , then shall he that smote him be quit : only he shall pay for the loss of his time , and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed .
and the garment , either warp , or woof , or whatsoever thing of skin it be , which thou shalt wash , if the plague be departed from them , then it shall be washed the second time , and shall be clean .
and if we know that he hear us , whatsoever we ask , we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him .
and this is the confidence that we have in him , that , if we ask any thing according to his will , he heareth us :
and we know that we are of god , and the whole world lieth in wickedness .
we know that whosoever is born of god sinneth not ; but he that is begotten of god keepeth himself , and that wicked one toucheth him not .
if he take him another wife ; her food , her raiment , and her duty of marriage , shall he not diminish .
and if he do not these three unto her , then shall she go out free without money .
he that smiteth a man , so that he die , shall be surely put to death .
and if a man lie not in wait , but god deliver him into his hand ; then i will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee .
but if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour , to slay him with guile ; thou shalt take him from mine altar , that he may die .
and he that smiteth his father , or his mother , shall be surely put to death .
and he that stealeth a man , and selleth him , or if he be found in his hand , he shall surely be put to death .
and he that curseth his father , or his mother , shall surely be put to death .
and the priest shall look upon the plague , and shut up it that hath the plague seven days :
and we know that the son of god is come , and hath given us an understanding , that we may know him that is true , and we are in him that is true , even in his son jesus christ . this is the true god , and eternal life .
and he shall look on the plague on the seventh day : if the plague be spread in the garment , either in the warp , or in the woof , or in a skin , or in any work that is made of skin ; the plague is a fretting leprosy ; it is unclean .
then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the plague is , and he shall shut it up seven days more :
he shall therefore burn that garment , whether warp or woof , in woollen or in linen , or any thing of skin , wherein the plague is : for it is a fretting leprosy ; it shall be burnt in the fire .
and if the priest shall look , and , behold , the plague be not spread in the garment , either in the warp , or in the woof , or in any thing of skin ;
all the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be defiled ; he is unclean : he shall dwell alone ; without the camp shall his habitation be .
and the leper in whom the plague is , his clothes shall be rent , and his head bare , and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip , and shall cry , unclean , unclean .
whether it be in the warp , or woof ; of linen , or of woollen ; whether in a skin , or in any thing made of skin ;
the garment also that the plague of leprosy is in , whether it be a woollen garment , or a linen garment ;
and if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment , or in the skin , either in the warp , or in the woof , or in any thing of skin ; it is a plague of leprosy , and shall be shewed unto the priest :
and , behold , cushi came ; and cushi said , tidings , my lord the king : for the lord hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee .
and the king said unto him , turn aside , and stand here . and he turned aside , and stood still .
and the man whose hair is fallen off his head , he is bald ; yet is he clean .
and the king was much moved , and went up to the chamber over the gate , and wept : and as he went , thus he said , o my son absalom , my son , my son absalom ! would god i had died for thee , o absalom , my son , my son !
and he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face , he is forehead bald : yet is he clean .
and the king said unto cushi , is the young man absalom safe ? and cushi answered , the enemies of my lord the king , and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt , be as that young man is .
and if there be in the bald head , or bald forehead , a white reddish sore ; it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head , or his bald forehead .
then the priest shall look upon it : and , behold , if the rising of the sore be white reddish in his bald head , or in his bald forehead , as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh ;
he is a leprous man , he is unclean : the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean ; his plague is in his head .
take away the wicked from before the king , and his throne shall be established in righteousness .
take away the dross from the silver , and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer .
the heaven for height , and the earth for depth , and the heart of kings is unsearchable .
it is the glory of god to conceal a thing : but the honour of kings is to search out a matter .
these are also proverbs of solomon , which the men of hezekiah king of judah copied out .
debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself ; and discover not a secret to another :
go not forth hastily to strive , lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof , when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame .
for better it is that it be said unto thee , come up hither ; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen .
put not forth thyself in the presence of the king , and stand not in the place of great men :
and he stayed yet other seven days ; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark ;
every beast , every creeping thing , and every fowl , and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth , after their kinds , went forth out of the ark .
go forth of the ark , thou , and thy wife , and thy sons , and thy sons ' wives with thee .
and god spake unto noah , saying ,
and noah went forth , and his sons , and his wife , and his sons ' wives with him :
bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee , of all flesh , both of fowl , and of cattle , and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth ; that they may breed abundantly in the earth , and be fruitful , and multiply upon the earth .
and he stayed yet other seven days ; and sent forth the dove ; which returned not again unto him any more .
and the dove came in to him in the evening ; and , lo , in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off : so noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth .
and in the second month , on the seven and twentieth day of the month , was the earth dried .
and it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year , in the first month , the first day of the month , the waters were dried up from off the earth : and noah removed the covering of the ark , and looked , and , behold , the face of the ground was dry .
and noah builded an altar unto the lord ; and took of every clean beast , and of every clean fowl , and offered burnt offerings on the altar .
while the earth remaineth , seedtime and harvest , and cold and heat , and summer and winter , and day and night shall not cease .
now jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him , and said unto them , do ye inquire among yourselves of that i said , a little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me ?
they said therefore , what is this that he saith , a little while ? we cannot tell what he saith .
then said some of his disciples among themselves , what is this that he saith unto us , a little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me : and , because i go to the father ?
keep therefore the words of this covenant , and do them , that ye may prosper in all that ye do .
i have yet many things to say unto you , but ye cannot bear them now .
yet the lord hath not given you an heart to perceive , and eyes to see , and ears to hear , unto this day .
of judgment , because the prince of this world is judged .
the great temptations which thine eyes have seen , the signs , and those great miracles :
and i will smite the winter house with the summer house ; and the houses of ivory shall perish , and the great houses shall have an end , saith the lord .
of righteousness , because i go to my father , and ye see me no more ;
and moses called unto all israel , and said unto them , ye have seen all that the lord did before your eyes in the land of egypt unto pharaoh , and unto all his servants , and unto all his land ;
that in the day that i shall visit the transgressions of israel upon him i will also visit the altars of bethel : and the horns of the altar shall be cut off , and fall to the ground .
these are the words of the covenant , which the lord commanded moses to make with the children of israel in the land of moab , beside the covenant which he made with them in horeb .
hear ye , and testify in the house of jacob , saith the lord god , the god of hosts ,
a little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me , because i go to the father .
and we took their land , and gave it for an inheritance unto the reubenites , and to the gadites , and to the half tribe of manasseh .
thus saith the lord ; as the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of the lion two legs , or a piece of an ear ; so shall the children of israel be taken out that dwell in samaria in the corner of a bed , and in damascus in a couch .
and when ye came unto this place , sihon the king of heshbon , and og the king of bashan , came out against us unto battle , and we smote them :
therefore thus saith the lord god ; an adversary there shall be even round about the land ; and he shall bring down thy strength from thee , and thy palaces shall be spoiled .
he shall glorify me : for he shall receive of mine , and shall shew it unto you .
ye have not eaten bread , neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink : that ye might know that i am the lord your god .
for they know not to do right , saith the lord , who store up violence and robbery in their palaces .
howbeit when he , the spirit of truth , is come , he will guide you into all truth : for he shall not speak of himself ; but whatsoever he shall hear , that shall he speak : and he will shew you things to come .
and i have led you forty years in the wilderness : your clothes are not waxen old upon you , and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot .
is there any number of his armies ? and upon whom doth not his light arise ?
so the prophet departed , and waited for the king by the way , and disguised himself with ashes upon his face .
dominion and fear are with him , he maketh peace in his high places .
and the angel that talked with me came again , and waked me , as a man that is wakened out of his sleep ,
then he found another man , and said , smite me , i pray thee . and the man smote him , so that in smiting he wounded him .
behold even to the moon , and it shineth not ; yea , the stars are not pure in his sight .
and said unto me , what seest thou ? and i said , i have looked , and behold a candlestick all of gold , with a bowl upon the top of it , and his seven lamps thereon , and seven pipes to the seven lamps , which are upon the top thereof :
then said he unto him , because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the lord , behold , as soon as thou art departed from me , a lion shall slay thee . and as soon as he was departed from him , a lion found him , and slew him .
how then can man be justified with god ? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman ?
and two olive trees by it , one upon the right side of the bowl , and the other upon the left side thereof .
then answered bildad the shuhite , and said ,
and his servants said unto him , behold now , we have heard that the kings of the house of israel are merciful kings : let us , i pray thee , put sackcloth on our loins , and ropes upon our heads , and go out to the king of israel : peradventure he will save thy life .
moreover the word of the lord came unto me , saying ,
but the rest fled to aphek , into the city ; and there a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left . and ben - hadad fled , and came into the city , into an inner chamber .
the hands of zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house ; his hands shall also finish it ; and thou shalt know that the lord of hosts hath sent me unto you .
and a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the lord , smite me , i pray thee . and the man refused to smite him .
so i answered and spake to the angel that talked with me , saying , what are these , my lord ?
how much less man , that is a worm ? and the son of man , which is a worm ?
then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me , knowest thou not what these be ? and i said , no , my lord .
now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come from him , and did hastily catch it : and they said , thy brother ben - hadad . then he said , go ye , bring him . then ben - hadad came forth to him ; and he caused him to come up into the chariot .
then he answered and spake unto me , saying , this is the word of the lord unto zerubbabel , saying , not by might , nor by power , but by my spirit , saith the lord of hosts .
so they girded sackcloth on their loins , and put ropes on their heads , and came to the king of israel , and said , thy servant ben - hadad saith , i pray thee , let me live . and he said , is he yet alive ? he is my brother .
who art thou , o great mountain ? before zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain : and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings , crying , grace , grace unto it .
and it came to pass at the return of the year , that ben - hadad numbered the syrians , and went up to aphek , to fight against israel .
and number thee an army , like the army that thou hast lost , horse for horse , and chariot for chariot : and we will fight against them in the plain , and surely we shall be stronger than they . and he hearkened unto their voice , and did so .
and the children of israel were numbered , and were all present , and went against them : and the children of israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids ; but the syrians filled the country .
and there was yet a battle in gath , where was a man of great stature , that had on every hand six fingers , and on every foot six toes , four and twenty in number ; and he also was born to the giant .
and when he defied israel , jonathan the son of shimea the brother of david slew him .
and they pitched one over against the other seven days . and so it was , that in the seventh day the battle was joined : and the children of israel slew of the syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day .
these four were born to the giant in gath , and fell by the hand of david , and by the hand of his servants .
and they slew every one his man : and the syrians fled ; and israel pursued them : and ben - hadad the king of syria escaped on an horse with the horsemen .
and the prophet came to the king of israel , and said unto him , go , strengthen thy self , and mark , and see what thou doest : for at the return of the year the king of syria will come up against thee .
and ye my flock , the flock of my pasture , are men , and i am your god , saith the lord god .
and the king of israel went out , and smote the horses and chariots , and slew the syrians with a great slaughter .
thus shall they know that i the lord their god am with them , and that they , even the house of israel , are my people , saith the lord god .
and do this thing , take the kings away , every man out of his place , and put captains in their rooms :
and the servants of the king of syria said unto him , their gods are gods of the hills ; therefore they were stronger than we ; but let us fight against them in the plain , and surely we shall be stronger than they .
and david went and took the bones of saul and the bones of jonathan his son from the men of jabesh - gilead , which had stolen them from the street of beth - shan , where the philistines had hanged them , when the philistines had slain saul in gilboa :
and he brought up from thence the bones of saul and the bones of jonathan his son ; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged .
and i will raise up for them a plant of renown , and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land , neither bear the shame of the heathen any more .
and rizpah the daughter of aiah took sackcloth , and spread it for her upon the rock , from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven , and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day , nor the beasts of the field by night .
and they shall no more be a prey to the heathen , neither shall the beast of the land devour them ; but they shall dwell safely , and none shall make them afraid .
and it was told david what rizpah the daughter of aiah , the concubine of saul , had done .
therefore will i save my flock , and they shall no more be a prey ; and i will judge between cattle and cattle .
because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder , and pushed all the diseased with your horns , till ye have scattered them abroad ;
therefore thus saith the lord god unto them ; behold , i , even i , will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle .
and there was again a battle in gob with the philistines , where elhanan the son of jaare - oregim , a bethlehemite , slew the brother of goliath the gittite , the staff of whose spear was like a weaver ' s beam .
and ishbi - benob , which was of the sons of the giant , the weight of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight , he being girded with a new sword , thought to have slain david .
and i will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing ; and i will cause the shower to come down in his season ; there shall be showers of blessing .
but abishai the son of zeruiah succoured him , and smote the philistine , and killed him . then the men of david sware unto him , saying , thou shalt go no more out with us to battle , that thou quench not the light of israel .
and i will make with them a covenant of peace , and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land : and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness , and sleep in the woods .
and the bones of saul and jonathan his son buried they in the country of benjamin in zelah , in the sepulchre of kish his father : and they performed all that the king commanded . and after that god was intreated for the land .
and i the lord will be their god , and my servant david a prince among them ; i the lord have spoken it .
moreover the philistines had yet war again with israel ; and david went down , and his servants with him , and fought against the philistines : and david waxed faint .
and i will set up one shepherd over them , and he shall feed them , even my servant david ; he shall feed them , and he shall be their shepherd .
and as for you , o my flock , thus saith the lord god ; behold , i judge between cattle and cattle , between the rams and the he goats .
i will seek that which was lost , and bring again that which was driven away , and will bind up that which was broken , and will strengthen that which was sick : but i will destroy the fat and the strong ; i will feed them with judgment .
and as for my flock , they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet ; and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet .
seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture , but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures ? and to have drunk of the deep waters , but ye must foul the residue with your feet ?
and the king of israel went to his house heavy and displeased , and came to samaria .
for thus saith the lord god ; behold , i , even i , will both search my sheep , and seek them out .
and as thy servant was busy here and there , he was gone . and the king of israel said unto him , so shall thy judgment be ; thyself hast decided it .
and i will bring them out from the people , and gather them from the countries , and will bring them to their own land , and feed them upon the mountains of israel by the rivers , and in all the inhabited places of the country .
as a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered ; so will i seek out my sheep , and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day .
and he said unto him , thus saith the lord , because thou hast let go out of thy hand a man whom i appointed to utter destruction , therefore thy life shall go for his life , and thy people for his people .
i will feed my flock , and i will cause them to lie down , saith the lord god .
and he hasted , and took the ashes away from his face ; and the king of israel discerned him that he was of the prophets .
i will feed them in a good pasture , and upon the high mountains of israel shall their fold be : there shall they lie in a good fold , and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of israel .
and the lord said unto moses , stretch forth thine hand toward heaven , that there may be hail in all the land of egypt , upon man , and upon beast , and upon every herb of the field , throughout the land of egypt .
and he that regarded not the word of the lord left his servants and his cattle in the field .
they have stricken me , shalt thou say , and i was not sick ; they have beaten me , and i felt it not : when shall i awake ? i will seek it yet again .
he that feared the word of the lord among the servants of pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses :
yea , thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea , or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast .
thine eyes shall behold strange women , and thine heart shall utter perverse things .
only in the land of goshen , where the children of israel were , was there no hail .
and the hail smote throughout all the land of egypt all that was in the field , both man and beast ; and the hail smote every herb of the field , and brake every tree of the field .
so there was hail , and fire mingled with the hail , very grievous , such as there was none like it in all the land of egypt since it became a nation .
and moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven : and the lord sent thunder and hail , and the fire ran along upon the ground ; and the lord rained hail upon the land of egypt .
and moses said unto him , as soon as i am gone out of the city , i will spread abroad my hands unto the lord ; and the thunder shall cease , neither shall there be any more hail ; that thou mayest know how that the earth is the lord ' s .
intreat the lord ( for it is enough ) that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail ; and i will let you go , and ye shall stay no longer .
and pharaoh sent , and called for moses and aaron , and said unto them , i have sinned this time : the lord is righteous , and i and my people are wicked .
let thy garments be always white ; and let thy head lack no ointment .
live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity , which he hath given thee under the sun , all the days of thy vanity : for that is thy portion in this life , and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun .
and the mean man boweth down , and the great man humbleth himself : therefore forgive them not .
also their love , and their hatred , and their envy , is now perished ; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun .
their land also is full of idols ; they worship the work of their own hands , that which their own fingers have made :
the children of arah , six hundred fifty and two .
go thy way , eat thy bread with joy , and drink thy wine with a merry heart ; for god now accepteth thy works .
their land also is full of silver and gold , neither is there any end of their treasures ; their land is also full of horses , neither is there any end of their chariots :
for to him that is joined to all the living there is hope : for a living dog is better than a dead lion .
for the living know that they shall die : but the dead know not any thing , neither have they any more a reward ; for the memory of them is forgotten .
wherefore king darius signed the writing and the decree .
this is an evil among all things that are done under the sun , that there is one event unto all : yea , also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil , and madness is in their heart while they live , and after that they go to the dead .
and it shall come to pass in the last days , that the mountain of the lord ' s house shall be established in the top of the mountains , and shall be exalted above the hills ; and all nations shall flow unto it .
for all this i considered in my heart even to declare all this , that the righteous , and the wise , and their works , are in the hand of god : no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them .
now , o king , establish the decree , and sign the writing , that it be not changed , according to the law of the medes and persians , which altereth not .
then said these men , we shall not find any occasion against this daniel , except we find it against him concerning the law of his god .
then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king , and said thus unto him , king darius , live for ever .
therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of jacob , because they be replenished from the east , and are soothsayers like the philistines , and they please themselves in the children of strangers .
then this daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes , because an excellent spirit was in him ; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm .
o house of jacob , come ye , and let us walk in the light of the lord .
then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against daniel concerning the kingdom ; but they could find none occasion nor fault ; forasmuch as he was faithful , neither was there any error or fault found in him .
and he shall judge among the nations , and shall rebuke many people : and they shall beat their swords into plowshares , and their spears into pruninghooks : nation shall not lift up sword against nation , neither shall they learn war any more .
it pleased darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes , which should be over the whole kingdom ;
and over these three presidents ; of whom daniel was first : that the princes might give accounts unto them , and the king should have no damage .
and the flax and the barley was smitten : for the barley was in the ear , and the flax was bolled .
if i had called , and he had answered me ; yet would i not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice .
but as for thee and thy servants , i know that ye will not yet fear the lord god .
whom , though i were righteous , yet would i not answer , but i would make supplication to my judge .
and moses went out of the city from pharaoh , and spread abroad his hands unto the lord : and the thunders and hail ceased , and the rain was not poured upon the earth .
how much less shall i answer him , and choose out my words to reason with him ?
but the wheat and the rie were not smitten : for they were not grown up .
if god will not withdraw his anger , the proud helpers do stoop under him .
and the heart of pharaoh was hardened , neither would he let the children of israel go ; as the lord had spoken by moses .
behold , he taketh away , who can hinder him ? who will say unto him , what doest thou ?
and when pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased , he sinned yet more , and hardened his heart , he and his servants .
lo , he goeth by me , and i see him not : he passeth on also , but i perceive him not .
which doeth great things past finding out ; yea , and wonders without number .
the children of bigvai , two thousand threescore and seven .
the children of adonikam , six hundred threescore and seven .
the children of azgad , two thousand three hundred twenty and two .
the children of bebai , six hundred twenty and eight .
and every little chamber was one reed long , and one reed broad ; and between the little chambers were five cubits ; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within was one reed .
the children of binnui , six hundred forty and eight .
then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east , and went up the stairs thereof , and measured the threshold of the gate , which was one reed broad ; and the other threshold of the gate , which was one reed broad .
the children of zaccai , seven hundred and threescore .
in the five and twentieth year of our captivity , in the beginning of the year , in the tenth day of the month , in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten , in the selfsame day the hand of the lord was upon me , and brought me thither .
for god is my witness , whom i serve with my spirit in the gospel of his son , that without ceasing i make mention of you always in my prayers ;
the children of zattu , eight hundred forty and five .
if i speak of strength , lo , he is strong : and if of judgment , who shall set me a time to plead ?
first , i thank my god through jesus christ for you all , that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world .
now peter and john went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer , being the ninth hour .
the children of elam , a thousand two hundred fifty and four .
he will not suffer me to take my breath , but filleth me with bitterness .
and he brought me thither , and , behold , there was a man , whose appearance was like the appearance of brass , with a line of flax in his hand , and a measuring reed ; and he stood in the gate .
and a certain man lame from his mother ' s womb was carried , whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called beautiful , to ask alms of them that entered into the temple ;
the children of pahath - moab , of the children of jeshua and joab , two thousand and eight hundred and eighteen .
for he breaketh me with a tempest , and multiplieth my wounds without cause .
by whom we have received grace and apostleship , for obedience to the faith among all nations , for his name :
and peter , fastening his eyes upon him with john , said , look on us .
the children of adin , six hundred fifty and five .
among whom are ye also the called of jesus christ :
who seeing peter and john about to go into the temple asked an alms .
the children of ater of hezekiah , ninety and eight .
concerning his son jesus christ our lord , which was made of the seed of david according to the flesh ;
then peter said , silver and gold have i none ; but such as i have give i thee : in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk .
and declared to be the son of god with power , according to the spirit of holiness , by the resurrection from the dead :
and he gave heed unto them , expecting to receive something of them .
paul , a servant of jesus christ , called to be an apostle , separated unto the gospel of god ,
and he leaping up stood , and walked , and entered with them into the temple , walking , and leaping , and praising god .
he measured also the porch of the gate within , one reed .
( which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures , )
and he took him by the right hand , and lifted him up : and immediately his feet and ancle bones received strength .
then measured he the porch of the gate , eight cubits ; and the posts thereof , two cubits ; and the porch of the gate was inward .
and all the people saw him walking and praising god :
though i were perfect , yet would i not know my soul : i would despise my life .
if i justify myself , mine own mouth shall condemn me : if i say , i am perfect , it shall also prove me perverse .
if the scourge slay suddenly , he will laugh at the trial of the innocent .
this is one thing , therefore i said it , he destroyeth the perfect and the wicked .
now my days are swifter than a post : they flee away , they see no good .
the earth is given into the hand of the wicked : he covereth the faces of the judges thereof ; if not , where , and who is he ?
if i say , i will forget my complaint , i will leave off my heaviness , and comfort myself :
they are passed away as the swift ships : as the eagle that hasteth to the prey .
the children of bezai , three hundred twenty and four .
if i be wicked , why then labour i in vain ?
the children of hashum , three hundred twenty and eight .
i am afraid of all my sorrows , i know that thou wilt not hold me innocent .
the children of gibeon , ninety and five .
the men of anathoth , an hundred twenty and eight .
the men of bethlehem and netophah , an hundred fourscore and eight .
the men of kirjath - jearim , chephirah , and beeroth , seven hundred forty and three .

the men of michmas , an hundred and twenty and two .
the men of bethel and ai , an hundred twenty and three .
and the lord said unto moses , rise up early in the morning , and stand before pharaoh , and say unto him , thus saith the lord god of the hebrews , let my people go , that they may serve me .
let him take his rod away from me , and let not his fear terrify me :
and the lord hardened the heart of pharaoh , and he hearkened not unto them ; as the lord had spoken unto moses .
neither is there any daysman betwixt us , that might lay his hand upon us both .
for now i will stretch out my hand , that i may smite thee and thy people with pestilence ; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth .
for he is not a man , as i am , that i should answer him , and we should come together in judgment .
for i will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart , and upon thy servants , and upon thy people ; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth .
yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch , and mine own clothes shall abhor me .
and the magicians could not stand before moses because of the boils ; for the boil was upon the magicians , and upon all the egyptians .
and they took ashes of the furnace , and stood before pharaoh ; and moses sprinkled it up toward heaven ; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man , and upon beast .
then would i speak , and not fear him ; but it is not so with me .
the children of jericho , three hundred forty and five .
the children of harim , three hundred and twenty .
the children of the other elam , a thousand two hundred fifty and four .
the men of the other nebo , fifty and two .
as yet exaltest thou thyself against my people , that thou wilt not let them go ?
and in very deed for this cause have i raised thee up , for to shew in thee my power ; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth .
the priests : the children of jedaiah , of the house of jeshua , nine hundred seventy and three .
send therefore now , and gather thy cattle , and all that thou hast in the field ; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field , and shall not be brought home , the hail shall come down upon them , and they shall die .
the children of senaah , three thousand nine hundred and thirty .
behold , to morrow about this time i will cause it to rain a very grievous hail , such as hath not been in egypt since the foundation thereof even until now .
the children of lod , hadid , and ono , seven hundred twenty and one .
him that is weak in the faith receive ye , but not to doubtful disputations .
for one believeth that he may eat all things : another , who is weak , eateth herbs .
let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not ; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth : for god hath received him .
who art thou that judgest another man ' s servant ? to his own master he standeth or falleth . yea , he shall be holden up : for god is able to make him stand .
one man esteemeth one day above another : another esteemeth every day alike . let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind .
the children of harim , a thousand and seventeen .
the levites : the children of jeshua , of kadmiel , and of the children of hodevah , seventy and four .
for none of us liveth to himself , and no man dieth to himself .
the children of immer , a thousand fifty and two .
for whether we live , we live unto the lord ; and whether we die , we die unto the lord : whether we live therefore , or die , we are the lord ' s .
the children of pashur , a thousand two hundred forty and seven .
for to this end christ both died , and rose , and revived , that he might be lord both of the dead and living .
if i wash myself with snow water , and make my hands never so clean ;
and enos lived ninety years , and begat cainan :
and seth lived after he begat enos eight hundred and seven years , and begat sons and daughters :
and all the days of seth were nine hundred and twelve years : and he died .
and all the days that adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years : and he died .
and seth lived an hundred and five years , and begat enos :
and adam lived an hundred and thirty years , and begat a son in his own likeness , after his image ; and called his name seth :
and the days of adam after he had begotten seth were eight hundred years : and he begat sons and daughters :
and when the sabbath day was come , he began to teach in the synagogue : and many hearing him were astonished , saying , from whence hath this man these things ? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him , that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands ?
is not this the carpenter , the son of mary , the brother of james , and joses , and of juda , and simon ? and are not his sisters here with us ? and they were offended at him .
and he went out from thence , and came into his own country ; and his disciples follow him .
male and female created he them ; and blessed them , and called their name adam , in the day when they were created .
this is the book of the generations of adam . in the day that god created man , in the likeness of god made he him ;
behold , i will corrupt your seed , and spread dung upon your faces , even the dung of your solemn feasts ; and one shall take you away with it .
my covenant was with him of life and peace ; and i gave them to him for the fear wherewith he feared me , and was afraid before my name .
and ye shall know that i have sent this commandment unto you , that my covenant might be with levi , saith the lord of hosts .
and now , o ye priests , this commandment is for you .
for the priest ' s lips should keep knowledge , and they should seek the law at his mouth : for he is the messenger of the lord of hosts .
the law of truth was in his mouth , and iniquity was not found in his lips : he walked with me in peace and equity , and did turn many away from iniquity .
therefore have i also made you contemptible and base before all the people , according as ye have not kept my ways , but have been partial in the law .
but ye are departed out of the way ; ye have caused many to stumble at the law ; ye have corrupted the covenant of levi , saith the lord of hosts .
if thou be wise , thou shalt be wise for thyself : but if thou scornest , thou alone shalt bear it .
for by me thy days shall be multiplied , and the years of thy life shall be increased .
the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom : and the knowledge of the holy is understanding .
whoso is simple , let him turn in hither : and as for him that wanteth understanding , she saith to him ,
to call passengers who go right on their ways :
for she sitteth at the door of her house , on a seat in the high places of the city ,
a foolish woman is clamourous : she is simple , and knoweth nothing .
but he knoweth not that the dead are there ; and that her guests are in the depths of hell .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
command the children of israel , that they put out of the camp every leper , and every one that hath an issue , and whosoever is defiled by the dead :
both male and female shall ye put out , without the camp shall ye put them ; that they defile not their camps , in the midst whereof i dwell .
and the children of israel did so , and put them out without the camp : as the lord spake unto moses , so did the children of israel .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
speak unto the children of israel , when a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit , to do a trespass against the lord , and that person be guilty ;
then they shall confess their sin which they have done : and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof , and add unto it the fifth part thereof , and give it unto him against whom he hath trespassed .
but if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto , let the trespass be recompensed unto the lord , even to the priest ; beside the ram of the atonement , whereby an atonement shall be made for him .
and every offering of all the holy things of the children of israel , which they bring unto the priest , shall be his .
and abimelech the son of jerubbaal went to shechem unto his mother ' s brethren , and communed with them , and with all the family of the house of his mother ' s father , saying ,
but be shod with sandals ; and not put on two coats .
and commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey , save a staff only ; no scrip , no bread , no money in their purse :
as we said before , so say i now again , if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received , let him be accursed .
which is not another ; but there be some that trouble you , and would pervert the gospel of christ .
and he could there do no mighty work , save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk , and healed them .
but though we , or an angel from heaven , preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you , let him be accursed .
but jesus said unto them , a prophet is not without honour , but in his own country , and among his own kin , and in his own house .
to whom be glory for ever and ever . amen .
and he called unto him the twelve , and began to send them forth by two and two ; and gave them power over unclean spirits ;
i marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of christ unto another gospel :
and he marvelled because of their unbelief . and he went round about the villages , teaching .
who gave himself for our sins , that he might deliver us from this present evil world , according to the will of god and our father :
grace be to you and peace from god the father , and from our lord jesus christ ,
and all the brethren which are with me , unto the churches of galatia :
paul , an apostle , ( not of men , neither by man , but by jesus christ , and god the father , who raised him from the dead ; )
and all the men of shechem gathered together , and all the house of millo , and went , and made abimelech king , by the plain of the pillar that was in shechem .
and when they told it to jotham , he went and stood in the top of mount gerizim , and lifted up his voice , and cried , and said unto them , hearken unto me , ye men of shechem , that god may hearken unto you .
the trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them ; and they said unto the olive tree , reign thou over us .
but the olive tree said unto them , should i leave my fatness , wherewith by me they honour god and man , and go to be promoted over the trees ?
speak , i pray you , in the ears of all the men of shechem , whether is better for you , either that all the sons of jerubbaal , which are threescore and ten persons , reign over you , or that one reign over you ? remember also that i am your bone and your flesh .
and his mother ' s brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of shechem all these words : and their hearts inclined to follow abimelech ; for they said , he is our brother .
and they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of baal - berith , wherewith abimelech hired vain and light persons , which followed him .
and he went unto his father ' s house at ophrah , and slew his brethren the sons of jerubbaal , being threescore and ten persons , upon one stone : notwithstanding yet jotham the youngest son of jerubbaal was left ; for he hid himself .
and make one cherub on the one end , and the other cherub on the other end : even of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubims on the two ends thereof .
and thou shalt make two cherubims of gold , of beaten work shalt thou make them , in the two ends of the mercy seat .
and thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure gold : two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof , and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof .
and thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which i shall give thee .
the staves shall be in the rings of the ark : they shall not be taken from it .
and thou shalt put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark , that the ark may be borne with them .
and thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it , and put them in the four corners thereof ; and two rings shall be in the one side of it , and two rings in the other side of it .
and thou shalt make staves of shittim wood , and overlay them with gold .
and they shall make an ark of shittim wood : two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof , and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof , and a cubit and a half the height thereof .
and thou shalt overlay it with pure gold , within and without shalt thou overlay it , and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about .
and when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled , that is to say , with unwashen , hands , they found fault .
then came together unto him the pharisees , and certain of the scribes , which came from jerusalem .
that the blood of all the prophets , which was shed from the foundation of the world , may be required of this generation ;
from the blood of abel unto the blood of zacharias , which perished between the altar and the temple : verily i say unto you , it shall be required of this generation .
woe unto you , lawyers ! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge : ye entered not in yourselves , and them that were entering in ye hindered .
and as he said these things unto them , the scribes and the pharisees began to urge him vehemently , and to provoke him to speak of many things :
laying wait for him , and seeking to catch something out of his mouth , that they might accuse him .
and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron , saying ,
of a talent of pure gold shall he make it , with all these vessels .
and the tongs thereof , and the snuffdishes thereof , shall be of pure gold .
and thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof : and they shall light the lamps thereof , that they may give light over against it .
their knops and their branches shall be of the same : all it shall be one beaten work of pure gold .
and thou shalt set upon the table shewbread before me alway .
and thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold : of beaten work shall the candlestick be made : his shaft , and his branches , his bowls , his knops , and his flowers , shall be of the same .
and in the candlestick shall be four bowls made like unto almonds , with their knops and their flowers .
and there shall be a knop under two branches of the same , and a knop under two branches of the same , and a knop under two branches of the same , according to the six branches that proceed out of the candlestick .
and six branches shall come out of the sides of it ; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side , and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side :
three bowls made like unto almonds , with a knop and a flower in one branch ; and three bowls made like almonds in the other branch , with a knop and a flower : so in the six branches that come out of the candlestick .
but we had the sentence of death in ourselves , that we should not trust in ourselves , but in god which raiseth the dead :
for as the sufferings of christ abound in us , so our consolation also aboundeth by christ .
and whether we be afflicted , it is for your consolation and salvation , which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer : or whether we be comforted , it is for your consolation and salvation .
and our hope of you is stedfast , knowing , that as ye are partakers of the sufferings , so shall ye be also of the consolation .
paul , an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god , and timothy our brother , unto the church of god which is at corinth , with all the saints which are in all achaia :
grace be to you and peace from god our father , and from the lord jesus christ .
blessed be god , even the father of our lord jesus christ , the father of mercies , and the god of all comfort ;
who comforteth us in all our tribulation , that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble , by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of god .
and thou shalt make for it four rings of gold , and put the rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof .
for our soul is bowed down to the dust : our belly cleaveth unto the earth .
and thou shalt make unto it a border of an hand breadth round about , and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round about .
wherefore hidest thou thy face , and forgettest our affliction and our oppression ?
and thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood , and overlay them with gold , that the table may be borne with them .
over against the border shall the rings be for places of the staves to bear the table .
arise for our help , and redeem us for thy mercies ' sake .
shall not god search this out ? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart .
if we have forgotten the name of our god , or stretched out our hands to a strange god ;
awake , why sleepest thou , o lord ? arise , cast us not off for ever .
yea , for thy sake are we killed all the day long ; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter .
and thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark ; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that i shall give thee .
and there i will meet with thee , and i will commune with thee from above the mercy seat , from between the two cherubims which are upon the ark of the testimony , of all things which i will give thee in commandment unto the children of israel .
thou shalt also make a table of shittim wood : two cubits shall be the length thereof , and a cubit the breadth thereof , and a cubit and a half the height thereof .
and thou shalt overlay it with pure gold , and make thereto a crown of gold round about .
thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat ; and hast scattered us among the heathen .
thou sellest thy people for nought , and dost not increase thy wealth by their price .
thou makest us to turn back from the enemy : and they which hate us spoil for themselves .
my confusion is continually before me , and the shame of my face hath covered me ,
for the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth ; by reason of the enemy and avenger .
thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours , a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us .
thou makest us a byword among the heathen , a shaking of the head among the people .
though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons , and covered us with the shadow of death .
all this is come upon us ; yet have we not forgotten thee , neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant .
our heart is not turned back , neither have our steps declined from thy way ;
then goeth he , and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself ; and they enter in , and dwell there : and the last state of that man is worse than the first .
and when he cometh , he findeth it swept and garnished .
when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man , he walketh through dry places , seeking rest ; and finding none , he saith , i will return unto my house whence i came out .
and when the people were gathered thick together , he began to say , this is an evil generation : they seek a sign ; and there shall no sign be given it , but the sign of jonas the prophet .
but he said , yea rather , blessed are they that hear the word of god , and keep it .
he that is not with me is against me : and he that gathereth not with me scattereth .
but when a stronger than he shall come upon him , and overcome him , he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted , and divideth his spoils .
when a strong man armed keepeth his palace , his goods are in peace :
but if i with the finger of god cast out devils , no doubt the kingdom of god is come upon you .
and he was casting out a devil , and it was dumb . and it came to pass , when the devil was gone out , the dumb spake ; and the people wondered .
if ye then , being evil , know how to give good gifts unto your children : how much more shall your heavenly father give the holy spirit to them that ask him ?
and others , tempting him , sought of him a sign from heaven .
but some of them said , he casteth out devils through beelzebub the chief of the devils .
but he , knowing their thoughts , said unto them , every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation ; and a house divided against a house falleth .
and if i by beelzebub cast out devils , by whom do your sons cast them out ? therefore shall they be your judges .
or if he shall ask an egg , will he offer him a scorpion ?
if a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father , will he give him a stone ? or if he ask a fish , will he for a fish give him a serpent ?
and it was about the space of three hours after , when his wife , not knowing what was done , came in .
and the priest shall take cedar wood , and hyssop , and scarlet , and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer .
and peter answered unto her , tell me whether ye sold the land for so much ? and she said , yea , for so much .
then the priest shall wash his clothes , and he shall bathe his flesh in water , and afterward he shall come into the camp , and the priest shall be unclean until the even .
and ananias hearing these words fell down , and gave up the ghost : and great fear came on all them that heard these things .
and he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water , and bathe his flesh in water , and shall be unclean until the even .
and the young men arose , wound him up , and carried him out , and buried him .
and a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer , and lay them up without the camp in a clean place , and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of israel for a water of separation : it is a purification for sin .
but peter said , ananias , why hath satan filled thine heart to lie to the holy ghost , and to keep back part of the price of the land ?
this is the ordinance of the law which the lord hath commanded , saying , speak unto the children of israel , that they bring thee a red heifer without spot , wherein is no blemish , and upon which never came yoke :
whiles it remained , was it not thine own ? and after it was sold , was it not in thine own power ? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart ? thou hast not lied unto men , but unto god .
and ye shall give her unto eleazar the priest , that he may bring her forth without the camp , and one shall slay her before his face :
but a certain man named ananias , with sapphira his wife , sold a possession ,
and eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger , and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times :
and kept back part of the price , his wife also being privy to it , and brought a certain part , and laid it at the apostles ' feet .
and one shall burn the heifer in his sight ; her skin , and her flesh , and her blood , with her dung , shall he burn :
then peter said unto her , how is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the spirit of the lord ? behold , the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door , and shall carry thee out .
therefore also said the wisdom of god , i will send them prophets and apostles , and some of them they shall slay and persecute :
truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers : for they indeed killed them , and ye build their sepulchres .
woe unto you ! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets , and your fathers killed them .
and he said , woe unto you also , ye lawyers ! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne , and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers .
then answered one of the lawyers , and said unto him , master , thus saying thou reproachest us also .
woe unto you , scribes and pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye are as graves which appear not , and the men that walk over them are not aware of them .
woe unto you , pharisees ! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues , and greetings in the markets .
but woe unto you , pharisees ! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs , and pass over judgment and the love of god : these ought ye to have done , and not to leave the other undone .
but rather give alms of such things as ye have ; and , behold , all things are clean unto you .
ye fools , did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also ?
our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease , and with the contempt of the proud .
and the lord said unto him , now do ye pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter ; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness .
if thy whole body therefore be full of light , having no part dark , the whole shall be full of light , as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light .
take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness .
unto thee lift i up mine eyes , o thou that dwellest in the heavens .
and when the pharisee saw it , he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner .
behold , as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters , and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress ; so our eyes wait upon the lord our god , until that he have mercy upon us .
and as he spake , a certain pharisee besought him to dine with him : and he went in , and sat down to meat .
have mercy upon us , o lord , have mercy upon us : for we are exceedingly filled with contempt .
the men of nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : for they repented at the preaching of jonas ; and , behold , a greater than jonas is here .
the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation , and condemn them : for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon ; and , behold , a greater than solomon is here .
the light of the body is the eye : therefore when thine eye is single , thy whole body also is full of light ; but when thine eye is evil , thy body also is full of darkness .
no man , when he hath lighted a candle , putteth it in a secret place , neither under a bushel , but on a candlestick , that they which come in may see the light .
for as jonas was a sign unto the ninevites , so shall also the son of man be to this generation .
and they , when they had testified and preached the word of the lord , returned to jerusalem , and preached the gospel in many villages of the samaritans .
and he arose and went : and , behold , a man of ethiopia , an eunuch of great authority under candace queen of the ethiopians , who had the charge of all her treasure , and had come to jerusalem for to worship ,
and the angel of the lord spake unto philip , saying , arise , and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from jerusalem unto gaza , which is desert .
then the spirit said unto philip , go near , and join thyself to this chariot .
was returning , and sitting in his chariot read esaias the prophet .
lead me in thy truth , and teach me : for thou art the god of my salvation ; on thee do i wait all the day .
remember , o lord , thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses ; for they have been ever of old .
yea , let none that wait on thee be ashamed : let them be ashamed which transgress without cause .
and philip ran thither to him , and heard him read the prophet esaias , and said , understandest thou what thou readest ?
shew me thy ways , o lord ; teach me thy paths .
and he said , how can i , except some man should guide me ? and he desired philip that he would come up and sit with him .
unto thee , o lord , do i lift up my soul .
the place of the scripture which he read was this , he was led as a sheep to the slaughter ; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer , so opened he not his mouth :
o my god , i trust in thee : let me not be ashamed , let not mine enemies triumph over me .
in his humiliation his judgment was taken away : and who shall declare his generation ? for his life is taken from the earth .
and the eunuch answered philip , and said , i pray thee , of whom speaketh the prophet this ? of himself , or of some other man ?
when ye go , ye shall come unto a people secure , and to a large land : for god hath given it into your hands ; a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth .
and they went up , and pitched in kirjath - jearim , in judah : wherefore they called that place mahaneh - dan unto this day : behold , it is behind kirjath - jearim .
then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of laish , and said unto their brethren , do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod , and teraphim , and a graven image , and a molten image ? now therefore consider what ye have to do .
the meek will he guide in judgment : and the meek will he teach his way .
and they passed thence unto mount ephraim , and came unto the house of micah .
and the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war , which were of the children of dan , stood by the entering of the gate .
remember not the sins of my youth , nor my transgressions : according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness ' sake , o lord .
and they turned thitherward , and came to the house of the young man the levite , even unto the house of micah , and saluted him .
good and upright is the lord : therefore will he teach sinners in the way .
and these went into micah ' s house , and fetched the carved image , the ephod , and the teraphim , and the molten image . then said the priest unto them , what do ye ?
and he commanded the chariot to stand still : and they went down both into the water , both philip and the eunuch ; and he baptized him .
and philip said , if thou believest with all thine heart , thou mayest . and he answered and said , i believe that jesus christ is the son of god .
and as they went on their way , they came unto a certain water : and the eunuch said , see , here is water ; what doth hinder me to be baptized ?
then philip opened his mouth , and began at the same scripture , and preached unto him jesus .
and when they were come up out of the water , the spirit of the lord caught away philip , that the eunuch saw him no more : and he went on his way rejoicing .
then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces , and they were two hundred and thirty two : and after them he numbered all the people , even all the children of israel , being seven thousand .
and they went out at noon . but ben - hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions , he and the kings , the thirty and two kings that helped him .
and the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first ; and ben - hadad sent out , and they told him , saying , there are men come out of samaria .
so these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city , and the army which followed them .
and they cried unto the children of dan . and they turned their faces , and said unto micah , what aileth thee , that thou comest with such a company ?
and when they were a good way from the house of micah , the men that were in the houses near to micah ' s house were gathered together , and overtook the children of dan .
so they turned and departed , and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them .
and the priest ' s heart was glad , and he took the ephod , and the teraphim , and the graven image , and went in the midst of the people .
and ben - hadad sent unto him , and said , the gods do so unto me , and more also , if the dust of samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me .
and they took the things which micah had made , and the priest which he had , and came unto laish , unto a people that were at quiet and secure : and they smote them with the edge of the sword , and burnt the city with fire .
and the king of israel answered and said , tell him , let not him that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off .
and the children of dan went their way : and when micah saw that they were too strong for him , he turned and went back unto his house .
and it came to pass , when ben - hadad heard this message , as he was drinking , he and the kings in the pavilions , that he said unto his servants , set yourselves in array . and they set themselves in array against the city .
and the children of dan said unto him , let not thy voice be heard among us , lest angry fellows run upon thee , and thou lose thy life , with the lives of thy household .
and , behold , there came a prophet unto ahab king of israel , saying , thus saith the lord , hast thou seen all this great multitude ? behold , i will deliver it in to thine hand this day ; and thou shalt know that i am the lord .
to whom they all gave heed , from the least to the greatest , saying , this man is the great power of god .
and to him they had regard , because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries .
but when they believed philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of god , and the name of jesus christ , they were baptized , both men and women .
and laban said , it must not be so done in our country , to give the younger before the firstborn .
and it came to pass , that in the morning , behold , it was leah : and he said to laban , what is this thou hast done unto me ? did not i serve with thee for rachel ? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me ?
and jacob did so , and fulfilled her week : and he gave him rachel his daughter to wife also .
fulfil her week , and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years .
and laban gave to rachel his daughter bilhah his handmaid to be her maid .
but they rebelled , and vexed his holy spirit : therefore he was turned to be their enemy , and he fought against them .
then he remembered the days of old , moses , and his people , saying , where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock ? where is he that put his holy spirit within him ?
that led them by the right hand of moses with his glorious arm , dividing the water before them , to make himself an everlasting name ?
and when simon saw that through laying on of the apostles ' hands the holy ghost was given , he offered them money ,
then laid they their hands on them , and they received the holy ghost .
who , when they were come down , prayed for them , that they might receive the holy ghost :
then simon himself believed also : and when he was baptized , he continued with philip , and wondered , beholding the miracles and signs which were done .
repent therefore of this thy wickedness , and pray god , if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee .
for i perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness , and in the bond of iniquity .
but peter said unto him , thy money perish with thee , because thou hast thought that the gift of god may be purchased with money .
thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter : for thy heart is not right in the sight of god .
as a beast goeth down into the valley , the spirit of the lord caused him to rest : so didst thou lead thy people , to make thyself a glorious name .
that led them through the deep , as an horse in the wilderness , that they should not stumble ?
doubtless thou art our father , though abraham be ignorant of us , and israel acknowledge us not : thou , o lord , art our father , our redeemer ; thy name is from everlasting .
and when the lord saw that leah was hated , he opened her womb : but rachel was barren .
look down from heaven , and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory : where is thy zeal and thy strength , the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me ? are they restrained ?
and leah conceived , and bare a son , and she called his name reuben : for she said , surely the lord hath looked upon my affliction ; now therefore my husband will love me .
the people of thy holiness have possessed it but a little while : our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary .
and she conceived again , and bare a son ; and said , because the lord hath heard that i was hated , he hath therefore given me this son also : and she called his name simeon .
o lord , why hast thou made us to err from thy ways , and hardened our heart from thy fear ? return for thy servants ' sake , the tribes of thine inheritance .
and she conceived again , and bare a son ; and said , now this time will my husband be joined unto me , because i have born him three sons : therefore was his name called levi .
and she conceived again , and bare a son : and she said , now will i praise the lord : therefore she called his name judah ; and left bearing .
we are thine : thou never barest rule over them ; they were not called by thy name .
and there arose not a prophet since in israel like unto moses , whom the lord knew face to face ,
in all the signs and the wonders , which the lord sent him to do in the land of egypt to pharaoh , and to all his servants , and to all his land ,
and jacob loved rachel ; and said , i will serve thee seven years for rachel thy younger daughter .
and laban said , it is better that i give her to thee , than that i should give her to another man : abide with me .
and laban had two daughters : the name of the elder was leah , and the name of the younger was rachel .
and in all that mighty hand , and in all the great terror which moses shewed in the sight of all israel .
leah was tender eyed ; but rachel was beautiful and well favoured .
and laban said to him , surely thou art my bone and my flesh . and he abode with him the space of a month .
and laban said unto jacob , because thou art my brother , shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought ? tell me , what shall thy wages be ?
and laban gave unto his daughter leah zilpah his maid for an handmaid .
and it came to pass in the evening , that he took leah his daughter , and brought her to him ; and he went in unto her .
and laban gathered together all the men of the place , and made a feast .
and jacob said unto laban , give me my wife , for my days are fulfilled , that i may go in unto her .
they shall not dwell in thy land , lest they make thee sin against me : for if thou serve their gods , it will surely be a snare unto thee .
thou shalt make no covenant with them , nor with their gods .
by little and little i will drive them out from before thee , until thou be increased , and inherit the land .
i will send my fear before thee , and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come , and i will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee .
and i will send hornets before thee , which shall drive out the hivite , the canaanite , and the hittite , from before thee .
i will not drive them out from before thee in one year ; lest the land become desolate , and the beast of the field multiply against thee .
for mine angel shall go before thee , and bring thee in unto the amorites , and the hittites , and the perizzites , and the canaanites , and the hivites , and the jebusites : and i will cut them off .
thou shalt not bow down to their gods , nor serve them , nor do after their works : but thou shalt utterly overthrow them , and quite break down their images .
and ye shall serve the lord your god , and he shall bless thy bread , and thy water ; and i will take sickness away from the midst of thee .
there shall nothing cast their young , nor be barren , in thy land : the number of thy days i will fulfil .
and look that thou make them after their pattern , which was shewed thee in the mount .
and jacob kissed rachel , and lifted up his voice , and wept .
as snow in summer , and as rain in harvest , so honour is not seemly for a fool .
and it came to pass , when jacob saw rachel the daughter of laban his mother ' s brother , and the sheep of laban his mother ' s brother , that jacob went near , and rolled the stone from the well ' s mouth , and watered the flock of laban his mother ' s brother .
as the bird by wandering , as the swallow by flying , so the curse causeless shall not come .
and it came to pass , when laban heard the tidings of jacob his sister ' s son , that he ran to meet him , and embraced him , and kissed him , and brought him to his house . and he told laban all these things .
a whip for the horse , a bridle for the ass , and a rod for the fool ' s back .
and jacob told rachel that he was her father ' s brother , and that he was rebekah ' s son : and she ran and told her father .
answer not a fool according to his folly , lest thou also be like unto him .
and i took the little book out of the angel ' s hand , and ate it up ; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey : and as soon as i had eaten it , my belly was bitter .
and he said unto me , thou must prophesy again before many peoples , and nations , and tongues , and kings .
behold , i send an angel before thee , to keep thee in the way , and to bring thee into the place which i have prepared .
as a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard , so is a parable in the mouth of fools .
but if thou shalt indeed obey his voice , and do all that i speak ; then i will be an enemy unto thine enemies , and an adversary unto thine adversaries .
beware of him , and obey his voice , provoke him not ; for he will not pardon your transgressions : for my name is in him .
answer a fool according to his folly , lest he be wise in his own conceit .
he that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet , and drinketh damage .
the legs of the lame are not equal : so is a parable in the mouth of fools .
as he that bindeth a stone in a sling , so is he that giveth honour to a fool .
and when they had fasted and prayed , and laid their hands on them , they sent them away .
as they ministered to the lord , and fasted , the holy ghost said , separate me barnabas and saul for the work whereunto i have called them .
now there were in the church that was at antioch certain prophets and teachers ; as barnabas , and simeon that was called niger , and lucius of cyrene , and manaen , which had been brought up with herod the tetrarch , and saul .
and when they had gone through the isle unto paphos , they found a certain sorcerer , a false prophet , a jew , whose name was bar - jesus :
which was with the deputy of the country , sergius paulus , a prudent man ; who called for barnabas and saul , and desired to hear the word of god .
so they , being sent forth by the holy ghost , departed unto seleucia ; and from thence they sailed to cyprus .
and when they were at salamis , they preached the word of god in the synagogues of the jews : and they had also john to their minister .
but elymas the sorcerer ( for so is his name by interpretation ) withstood them , seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith .
then saul , ( who also is called paul , ) filled with the holy ghost , set his eyes on him ,
go forth , o ye daughters of zion , and behold king solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals , and in the day of the gladness of his heart .
he made the pillars thereof of silver , the bottom thereof of gold , the covering of it of purple , the midst thereof being paved with love , for the daughters of jerusalem .
the third to harim , the fourth to seorim ,
the fifth to malchijah , the sixth to mijamin ,
it is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh , and the priest shall pronounce him unclean , and shall not shut him up : for he is unclean .
and the priest shall see him : and , behold , if the rising be white in the skin , and it have turned the hair white , and there be quick raw flesh in the rising ;
or if the raw flesh turn again , and be changed unto white , he shall come unto the priest ;
and the priest shall see him : and , behold , if the plague be turned into white ; then the priest shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague : he is clean .
the flesh also , in which , even in the skin thereof , was a boil , and is healed ,
and in the place of the boil there be a white rising , or a bright spot , white , and somewhat reddish , and it be shewed to the priest ;
and if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin , and the leprosy cover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to his foot , wheresoever the priest looketh ;
then the priest shall consider : and , behold , if the leprosy have covered all his flesh , he shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague : it is all turned white : he is clean .
but when raw flesh appeareth in him , he shall be unclean .
and the priest shall see the raw flesh , and pronounce him to be unclean : for the raw flesh is unclean : it is a leprosy .
now the first lot came forth to jehoiarib , the second to jedaiah ,
thus were they divided by lot , one sort with another ; for the governors of the sanctuary , and governors of the house of god , were of the sons of eleazar , and of the sons of ithamar .
and there were more chief men found of the sons of eleazar than of the sons of ithamar ; and thus were they divided . among the sons of eleazar there were sixteen chief men of the house of their fathers , and eight among the sons of ithamar according to the house of their fathers .
and david distributed them , both zadok of the sons of eleazar , and ahimelech of the sons of ithamar , according to their offices in their service .
but nadab and abihu died before their father , and had no children : therefore elezar and ithamar executed the priest ' s office .
now these are the divisions of the sons of aaron . the sons of aaron ; nadab , and abihu , eleazar , and ithamar .
and if it spread much abroad in the skin , then the priest shall pronounce him unclean : it is a plague .
but if the priest look on it , and , behold , there be no white hairs therein , and if it be not lower than the skin , but be somewhat dark ; then the priest shall shut him up seven days :
and if , when the priest seeth it , behold , it be in sight lower than the skin , and the hair thereof be turned white ; the priest shall pronounce him unclean : it is a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil .
then the priest shall look upon it : and , behold , if the hair in the bright spot be turned white , and it be in sight deeper than the skin ; it is a leprosy broken out of the burning : wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean : it is the plague of leprosy .
but if the priest look on it , and , behold , there be no white hair in the bright spot , and it be no lower than the other skin , but be somewhat dark ; then the priest shall shut him up seven days :
but if the bright spot stay in his place , and spread not , it is a burning boil ; and the priest shall pronounce him clean .
or if there be any flesh , in the skin whereof there is a hot burning , and the quick flesh that burneth have a white bright spot , somewhat reddish , or white ;
if a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard ;
and the priest shall look upon him the seventh day : and if it be spread much abroad in the skin , then the priest shall pronounce him unclean : it is the plague of leprosy .
and if the bright spot stay in his place , and spread not in the skin , but it be somewhat dark ; it is a rising of the burning , and the priest shall pronounce him clean : for it is an inflammation of the burning .
and if the priest look on the plague of the scall , and , behold , it be not in sight deeper than the skin , and that there is no black hair in it ; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of the scall seven days :
then the priest shall see the plague : and , behold , if it be in sight deeper than the skin ; and there be in it a yellow thin hair ; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean : it is a dry scall , even a leprosy upon the head or beard .
he shall be shaven , but the scall shall he not shave ; and the priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more :
and in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague : and , behold , if the scall spread not , and there be in it no yellow hair , and the scall be not in sight deeper than the skin ;
and in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall : and , behold , if the scall be not spread in the skin , nor be in sight deeper than the skin ; then the priest shall pronounce him clean : and he shall wash his clothes , and be clean .
but if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing ;
but if the scall be in his sight at a stay , and that there is black hair grown up therein ; the scall is healed , he is clean : and the priest shall pronounce him clean .
if a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots , even white bright spots ;
then the priest shall look : and , behold , if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh be darkish white ; it is a freckled spot that groweth in the skin ; he is clean .
for thou hast trusted in thy wickedness : thou hast said , none seeth me . thy wisdom and thy knowledge , it hath perverted thee ; and thou hast said in thine heart , i am , and none else beside me .
behold , they shall be as stubble ; the fire shall burn them ; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame : there shall not be a coal to warm at , nor fire to sit before it .
then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of god which was at jerusalem ; and the king , and his princes , his wives , and his concubines , drank in them .
thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels . let now the astrologers , the stargazers , the monthly prognosticators , stand up , and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee .
belshazzar , whiles he tasted the wine , commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in jerusalem ; that the king , and his princes , his wives , and his concubines , might drink therein .
stand now with thine enchantments , and with the multitude of thy sorceries , wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth ; if so be thou shalt be able to profit , if so be thou mayest prevail .
in the same hour came forth fingers of a man ' s hand , and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king ' s palace : and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote .
therefore shall evil come upon thee ; thou shalt not know from whence it riseth : and mischief shall fall upon thee ; thou shalt not be able to put it off : and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly , which thou shalt not know .
they drank wine , and praised the gods of gold , and of silver , of brass , of iron , of wood , and of stone .
then the king ' s countenance was changed , and his thoughts troubled him , so that the joints of his loins were loosed , and his knees smote one against another .
then was king belshazzar greatly troubled , and his countenance was changed in him , and his lords were astonied .
thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured , even thy merchants , from thy youth : they shall wander every one to his quarter ; none shall save thee .
then came in all the king ' s wise men : but they could not read the writing , nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof .
belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords , and drank wine before the thousand .
and they set them up micah ' s graven image , which he made , all the time that the house of god was in shiloh .
and the children of dan set up the graven image : and jonathan , the son of gershom , the son of manasseh , he and his sons were priests to the tribe of dan until the day of the captivity of the land .
and they called the name of the city dan , after the name of dan their father , who was born unto israel : howbeit the name of the city was laish at the first .
and there was no deliverer , because it was far from zidon , and they had no business with any man ; and it was in the valley that lieth by beth - rehob . and they built a city , and dwelt therein .
if thou doest well , shalt thou not be accepted ? and if thou doest not well , sin lieth at the door . and unto thee shall be his desire , and thou shalt rule over him .
and jehoiakim the king sent men into egypt , namely , elnathan the son of achbor , and certain men with him into egypt .
and the lord said unto cain , why art thou wroth ? and why is thy countenance fallen ?
and when jehoiakim the king , with all his mighty men , and all the princes , heard his words , the king sought to put him to death : but when urijah heard it , he was afraid , and fled , and went into egypt ;
but unto cain and to his offering he had not respect . and cain was very wroth , and his countenance fell .
and there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the lord , urijah the son of shemaiah of kirjath - jearim , who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of jeremiah :
and abel , he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof . and the lord had respect unto abel and to his offering :
and the lord said unto cain , where is abel thy brother ? and he said , i know not : am i my brother ' s keeper ?
and cain talked with abel his brother : and it came to pass , when they were in the field , that cain rose up against abel his brother , and slew him .
and his father isaac said unto him , come near now , and kiss me , my son .
have ye not known ? have ye not heard ? hath it not been told you from the beginning ? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth ?
and he said , bring it near to me , and i will eat of my son ' s venison , that my soul may bless thee . and he brought it near to him , and he did eat : and he brought him wine , and he drank .
the horse is prepared against the day of battle : but safety is of the lord .
it is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth , and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers ; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain , and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in :
and he said , art thou my very son esau ? and he said , i am .
and he discerned him not , because his hands were hairy , as his brother esau ' s hands : so he blessed him .
he that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot ; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image , that shall not be moved .
let people serve thee , and nations bow down to thee : be lord over thy brethren , and let thy mother ' s sons bow down to thee : cursed be every one that curseth thee , and blessed be he that blesseth thee .
therefore god give thee of the dew of heaven , and the fatness of the earth , and plenty of corn and wine :
nevertheless the hand of ahikam the son of shaphan was with jeremiah , that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death .
and the people shall be oppressed , every one by another , and every one by his neighbour : the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient , and the base against the honourable .
and i will give children to be their princes , and babes shall rule over them .
he giveth power to the faint ; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength .
the captain of fifty , and the honourable man , and the counseller , and the cunning artificer , and the eloquent orator .
hast thou not known ? hast thou not heard , that the everlasting god , the lord , the creator of the ends of the earth , fainteth not , neither is weary ? there is no searching of his understanding .
the mighty man , and the man of war , the judge , and the prophet , and the prudent , and the ancient ,
why sayest thou , o jacob , and speakest , o israel , my way is hid from the lord , and my judgment is passed over from my god ?
and isaac his father said unto him , who art thou ? and he said , i am thy son , thy firstborn esau .
how hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom ? and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is ?
who is as the wise man ? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing ? a man ' s wisdom maketh his face to shine , and the boldness of his face shall be changed .
for , behold , the lord , the lord of hosts , doth take away from jerusalem and from judah the stay and the staff , the whole stay of bread , and the whole stay of water ,
and he answered and spake unto those that stood before him , saying , take away the filthy garments from him . and unto him he said , behold , i have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee , and i will clothe thee with change of raiment .
to whom hast thou uttered words ? and whose spirit came from thee ?
i counsel thee to keep the king ' s commandment , and that in regard of the oath of god .
to whom then will ye liken me , or shall i be equal ? saith the holy one .
now joshua was clothed with filthy garments , and stood before the angel .
and it came to pass , as soon as isaac had made an end of blessing jacob , and jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of isaac his father , that esau his brother came in from his hunting .
but job answered and said ,
and the lord said unto satan , the lord rebuke thee , o satan ; even the lord that hath chosen jerusalem rebuke thee : is not this a brand plucked out of the fire ?
and he also had made savoury meat , and brought it unto his father , and said unto his father , let my father arise , and eat of his son ' s venison , that thy soul may bless me .
that bringeth the princes to nothing ; he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity .
and he shewed me joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the lord , and satan standing at his right hand to resist him .
he stretcheth out the north over the empty place , and hangeth the earth upon nothing .
whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing : and a wise man ' s heart discerneth both time and judgment .
hear now , o joshua the high priest , thou , and thy fellows that sit before thee : for they are men wondered at : for , behold , i will bring forth my servant the branch .
he bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds ; and the cloud is not rent under them .
because to every purpose there is time and judgment , therefore the misery of man is great upon him .
thus saith the lord of hosts ; if thou wilt walk in my ways , and if thou wilt keep my charge , then thou shalt also judge my house , and shalt also keep my courts , and i will give thee places to walk among these that stand by .
dead things are formed from under the waters , and the inhabitants thereof .
be not hasty to go out of his sight : stand not in an evil thing ; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him .
hell is naked before him , and destruction hath no covering .
where the word of a king is , there is power : and who may say unto him , what doest thou ?
and i said , let them set a fair mitre upon his head . so they set a fair mitre upon his head , and clothed him with garments . and the angel of the lord stood by .
and she again bare his brother abel . and abel was a keeper of sheep , but cain was a tiller of the ground .
all this have i seen , and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun : there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt .
the shew of their countenance doth witness against them ; and they declare their sin as sodom , they hide it not . woe unto their soul ! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves .
and in process of time it came to pass , that cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the lord .
for jerusalem is ruined , and judah is fallen : because their tongue and their doings are against the lord , to provoke the eyes of his glory .
he holdeth back the face of his throne , and spreadeth his cloud upon it .
for he knoweth not that which shall be : for who can tell him when it shall be ?
in that day shall he swear , saying , i will not be an healer ; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing : make me not a ruler of the people .
and adam knew eve his wife ; and she conceived , and bare cain , and said , i have gotten a man from the lord .
there is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit ; neither hath he power in the day of death : and there is no discharge in that war ; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it .
when a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father , saying , thou hast clothing , be thou our ruler , and let this ruin be under thy hand :
for behold the stone that i have laid before joshua ; upon one stone shall be seven eyes : behold , i will engrave the graving thereof , saith the lord of hosts , and i will remove the iniquity of that land in one day .
tribulation and anguish , upon every soul of man that doeth evil , of the jew first , and also of the gentile ;
but unto them that are contentious , and do not obey the truth , but obey unrighteousness , indignation and wrath ,
to them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality , eternal life :
then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people , saying , this man is worthy to die ; for he hath prophesied against this city , as ye have heard with your ears .
who will render to every man according to his deeds :
when the princes of judah heard these things , then they came up from the king ' s house unto the house of the lord , and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the lord ' s house .
and he said , thy brother came with subtilty , and hath taken away thy blessing .
and aaron said unto moses , alas , my lord , i beseech thee , lay not the sin upon us , wherein we have done foolishly , and wherein we have sinned .
even the youths shall faint and be weary , and the young men shall utterly fall :
then rose up certain of the elders of the land , and spake to all the assembly of the people , saying ,
and when esau heard the words of his father , he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry , and said unto his father , bless me , even me also , o my father .
and the cloud departed from off the tabernacle ; and , behold , miriam became leprous , white as snow : and aaron looked upon miriam , and , behold , she was leprous .
but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength ; they shall mount up with wings as eagles ; they shall run , and not be weary ; and they shall walk , and not faint .
then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets ; this man is not worthy to die : for he hath spoken to us in the name of the lord our god .
and isaac answered and said unto esau , behold , i have made him thy lord , and all his brethren have i given to him for servants ; and with corn and wine have i sustained him : and what shall i do now unto thee , my son ?
and moses cried unto the lord , saying , heal her now , o god , i beseech thee .
many sorrows shall be to the wicked : but he that trusteth in the lord , mercy shall compass him about .
did hezekiah king of judah and all judah put him at all to death ? did he not fear the lord , and besought the lord , and the lord repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them ? thus might we procure great evil against our souls .
and he said , is not he rightly named jacob ? for he hath supplanted me these two times : he took away my birthright ; and , behold , now he hath taken away my blessing . and he said , hast thou not reserved a blessing for me ?
let her not be as one dead , of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother ' s womb .
be glad in the lord , and rejoice , ye righteous : and shout for joy , all ye that are upright in heart .
micah the morasthite prophesied in the days of hezekiah king of judah , and spake to all the people of judah , saying , thus saith the lord of hosts ; zion shall be plowed like a field , and jerusalem shall become heaps , and the mountains of the house as the high places of a forest .
and isaac his father answered and said unto him , behold , thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth , and of the dew of heaven from above ;
and miriam was shut out from the camp seven days : and the people journeyed not till miriam was brought in again .
therefore now amend your ways and your doings , and obey the voice of the lord your god ; and the lord will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you .
and esau said unto his father , hast thou but one blessing , my father ? bless me , even me also , o my father . and esau lifted up his voice , and wept .
then spake jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people , saying , the lord sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard .
and afterward the people removed from hazeroth , and pitched in the wilderness of paran .
as for me , behold , i am in your hand : do with me as seemeth good and meet unto you .
and by thy sword shalt thou live , and shalt serve thy brother ; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion , that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck .
and esau hated jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him : and esau said in his heart , the days of mourning for my father are at hand ; then will i slay my brother jacob .
and these words of esau her elder son were told to rebekah : and she sent and called jacob her younger son , and said unto him , behold , thy brother esau , as touching thee , doth comfort himself , purposing to kill thee .
now therefore , my son , obey my voice ; and arise , flee thou to laban my brother to haran ;
and tarry with him a few days , until thy brother ' s fury turn away ;
therefore thou art inexcusable , o man , whosoever thou art that judgest : for wherein thou judgest another , thou condemnest thyself ; for thou that judgest doest the same things .
or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering ; not knowing that the goodness of god leadeth thee to repentance ?
but we are sure that the judgment of god is according to truth against them which commit such things .
and thinkest thou this , o man , that judgest them which do such things , and doest the same , that thou shalt escape the judgment of god ?
the wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous , and the transgressor for the upright .
he that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man : he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich .
it is better to dwell in the wilderness , than with a contentious and an angry woman .
a gift in secret pacifieth anger : and a reward in the bosom strong wrath .
whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor , he also shall cry himself , but shall not be heard .
the man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead .
it is joy to the just to do judgment : but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity .
the soul of the wicked desireth evil : his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes .
the righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked : but god overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness .
when the scorner is punished , the simple is made wise : and when the wise is instructed , he receiveth knowledge .
and thou shalt bring it to thy father , that he may eat , and that he may bless thee before his death .
and the lord spake unto moses , saying ,
and jacob said to rebekah his mother , behold , esau my brother is a hairy man , and i am a smooth man :
he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink , and shall drink no vinegar of wine , or vinegar of strong drink , neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes , nor eat moist grapes , or dried .
speak unto the children of israel , and say unto them , when either man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a nazarite , to separate themselves unto the lord :
and if any man die very suddenly by him , and he hath defiled the head of his consecration ; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing , on the seventh day shall he shave it .
all the days of his separation he is holy unto the lord .
all the days of the vow of his separation there shall no rasor come upon his head : until the days be fulfilled , in the which he separateth himself unto the lord , he shall be holy , and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow .
all the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine tree , from the kernels even to the husk .
he shall not make himself unclean for his father , or for his mother , for his brother , or for his sister , when they die : because the consecration of his god is upon his head .
all the days that he separateth himself unto the lord he shall come at no dead body .
a wicked man hardeneth his face : but as for the upright , he directeth his way .
a false witness shall perish : but the man that heareth speaketh constantly .
and she gave the savoury meat and the bread , which she had prepared , into the hand of her son jacob .
the sacrifice of the wicked is abomination : how much more , when he bringeth it with a wicked mind ?
and she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands , and upon the smooth of his neck :
he coveteth greedily all the day long : but the righteous giveth and spareth not .
and jacob said unto his father , i am esau thy firstborn ; i have done according as thou badest me : arise , i pray thee , sit and eat of my venison , that thy soul may bless me .
and he came unto his father , and said , my father : and he said , here am i ; who art thou , my son ?
proud and haughty scorner is his name , who dealeth in proud wrath .
and his mother said unto him , upon me be thy curse , my son : only obey my voice , and go fetch me them .
whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles .
my father peradventure will feel me , and i shall seem to him as a deceiver ; and i shall bring a curse upon me , and not a blessing .
a wise man scaleth the city of the mighty , and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof .
and rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son esau , which were with her in the house , and put them upon jacob her younger son :
he that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life , righteousness , and honour .
there is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise ; but a foolish man spendeth it up .
and isaac said unto his son , how is it that thou hast found it so quickly , my son ? and he said , because the lord thy god brought it to me .
there is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the lord .
and isaac said unto jacob , come near , i pray thee , that i may feel thee , my son , whether thou be my very son esau or not .
and jacob went near unto isaac his father ; and he felt him , and said , the voice is jacob ' s voice , but the hands are the hands of esau .
i will extol thee , my god , o king ; and i will bless thy name for ever and ever .
every day will i bless thee ; and i will praise thy name for ever and ever .
great is the lord , and greatly to be praised ; and his greatness is unsearchable .
one generation shall praise thy works to another , and shall declare thy mighty acts .
i will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty , and of thy wondrous works .
and men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts : and i will declare thy greatness .
they shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness , and shall sing of thy righteousness .
and if ye offer the blind for sacrifice , is it not evil ? and if ye offer the lame and sick , is it not evil ? offer it now unto thy governor ; will he be pleased with thee , or accept thy person ? saith the lord of hosts .
ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar ; and ye say , wherein have we polluted thee ? in that ye say , the table of the lord is contemptible .
and now , i pray you , beseech god that he will be gracious unto us : this hath been by your means : will he regard your persons ? saith the lord of hosts .
ye that fear the lord , trust in the lord : he is their help and their shield .
o house of aaron , trust in the lord : he is their help and their shield .
he will bless them that fear the lord , both small and great .
the lord hath been mindful of us : he will bless us ; he will bless the house of israel ; he will bless the house of aaron .
ye are blessed of the lord which made heaven and earth .
the lord shall increase you more and more , you and your children .
the dead praise not the lord , neither any that go down into silence .
i have loved you , saith the lord . yet ye say , wherein hast thou loved us ? was not esau jacob ' s brother ? saith the lord : yet i loved jacob ,
the heaven , even the heavens , are the lord ' s : but the earth hath he given to the children of men .
the burden of the word of the lord to israel by malachi .
whereas edom saith , we are impoverished , but we will return and build the desolate places ; thus saith the lord of hosts , they shall build , but i will throw down ; and they shall call them , the border of wickedness , and , the people against whom the lord hath indignation for ever .
but we will bless the lord from this time forth and for evermore . praise the lord .
and i hated esau , and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness .
and your eyes shall see , and ye shall say , the lord will be magnified from the border of israel .
the lord is good to all : and his tender mercies are over all his works .
the lord is gracious , and full of compassion ; slow to anger , and of great mercy .
and phinehas the son of eleazar the priest , and the princes , returned from the children of reuben , and from the children of gad , out of the land of gilead , unto the land of canaan , to the children of israel , and brought them word again .
and the thing pleased the children of israel ; and the children of israel blessed god , and did not intend to go up against them in battle , to destroy the land wherein the children of reuben and gad dwelt .
and the children of reuben and the children of gad called the altar ed : for it shall be a witness between us that the lord is god .
and when they come from the market , except they wash , they eat not . and many other things there be , which they have received to hold , as the washing of cups , and pots , brasen vessels , and of tables .
for the pharisees , and all the jews , except they wash their hands oft , eat not , holding the tradition of the elders .
he answered and said unto them , well hath esaias prophesied of you hypocrites , as it is written , this people honoureth me with their lips , but their heart is far from me .
then the pharisees and scribes asked him , why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders , but eat bread with unwashen hands ?
for laying aside the commandment of god , ye hold the tradition of men , as the washing of pots and cups : and many other such like things ye do .
howbeit in vain do they worship me , teaching for doctines the commandments of men .
and he said unto them , full well ye reject the commandment of god , that ye may keep your own tradition .
now the god of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to christ jesus :
for whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning , that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope .
wherefore receive ye one another , as christ also received us to the glory of god .
that ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify god , even the father of our lord jesus christ .
we then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak , and not to please ourselves .
for even christ pleased not himself ; but , as it is written , the reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me .
let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification .
and that the gentiles might glorify god for his mercy ; as it is written , for this cause i will confess to thee among the gentiles , and sing unto thy name .
now i say that jesus christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of god , to confirm the promises made unto the fathers :
